(PRWEB) October 11, 2019\n\nFor the first time, Today's Inspired Latina (TIL), an internationally acclaimed book series highlighting the success stories of Latinas, invited several young Hispanic women to speak about their personal experiences on the stage of North Central College's Wentz Concert Hall in Naperville, Illinois.\n\nShared on ENTITY, a worldwide audience met 12 dynamic local high school and college-age speakers who displayed poise, grace and a positive energy. Taking the stage were Evelyn Lozano, Alondra Ivette Guevara, Arianna Urrutia, Gina Aridal Pardino, Giselle Gonzalez, Andrea Vallejo, Samantha Ante, Maria Clara Ospina, Daniela Limon, Yahayra Argueta, Erica Franco and Scarlett Magana.\n\nJacqueline Camacho-Ruiz, Today's Inspired Latina's creator, beamed with pride and joy as she explained that the event idea came from Elizabeth Colón-Rivera, a TIL author, who suggested that young Latinas do a Latina Talks event of their own after participating in one. Jelena Sánchez, assistant professor of Spanish, Modern Languages at North Central College and another TIL author, also helped Camacho-Ruiz in finding the location for these talks. With the stage set, Camacho-Ruiz immediately started planning.\n\n\""When things are aligned, they happen,\"" she said. \""I began putting in a lot of 'heart' work -- not hard work-to make this happen,\"" she said.\n\nAt the event, Colón-Rivera spoke about the powerful emotional impact that she experienced participating during a Latina Talks event. She was impressed by the resilience these presenters displayed.\n\n\""You are our next generation,\"" she said. \""When I got on that stage and spoke at the Latina Talks, I thought it would be a great idea for the next generation to speak about their own experiences about bullying, respect, self-love, the loss of a parent, owning their power and about pressure. Your stories are impactful. You have an amazing journey ahead of you.\""\n\nAdditionally, the speakers were also vying for two college scholarships: a $1,000 Amazing Young Latina Scholarship and the newly created $500 Latina Leaders Scholarship awarded to a North Central College student. A panel of TIL Authors -- Colón-Rivera, Sánchez, Neli Vazquez Rowland, Macarena Tamayo-Calabrese, Jeannette Lurdez Collazo and Tamika Lecheé Morales -- chose Urrutia for the Amazing Young Latina Scholarship and Ospina for the Latina Leadership Scholarship.\n\nUrrutia, a North Central College senior who is also expecting her first child, shared an emotional story about the loss of her father as a result of a drug-induced overdose. She explained how many individuals will endure obstacles in their lives but the ultimate factor is how they move forward.\n\n\""You are continuously going to be challenged in life and you are continuously going to have to make hard choices,\"" she said. \""One of those choices is going to be how you move on (in your life.) Regardless of what happens, you have to move on. You have to keep going forward. You know why? If you don't who is going to pay the bills, secure your future and take care your family. No one. You only have yourself.\""\n\nMaking this event possible were the following sponsors: Metaphrasis, Fig Factor Media Publishing, Conectando Corazones, North Central College, Urban Air Adventure Park, 1 2 3 Got My Job, Ollin Technology and Jeannette Lurdez Collazo.\n\nFor more information about Today's Inspired Latina, visit: http://todayslatina.com.\n\nAbout Today's Inspired Latina:\n\nToday's Inspired Latina is a book series of inspiration and hope, a poignant collection of personal stories that will activate your passion.

Facebook,0,"BANGKOK - The Chinese embassy in Bangkok has condemned Thai politicians for showing support to Hong Kong activists amid mass anti-Beijing protests, saying that such move could harm the relationship between the two countries.\n\nThe criticism was echoed by Thailand's army chief, who on Friday spoke of \hidden agendas\"" in meetings between opposition activists.\n\nThe embassy statement, posted on its official ENTITY page late on Thursday, came days after Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong posted a picture on social media with prominent Thai opposition figure Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit.\n\n\""Some Thai politicians have contacted the group that wants to separate Hong Kong from China, showing gestures of support,\"" the embassy said in a Thai-language statement without naming individuals.\n\n\""This is wrong and irresponsible. China hopes that relevant people will understand the truth about problems in Hong Kong, act carefully and do useful things for the friendship between China and Thailand.\""\n\nWong and Thanathorn met on Oct. 5 at the Open Future Festival in Hong Kong, attending as speakers at the annual event.\n\n\""Under the hard-line authoritarian suppression, we stand in solidarity,\"" Wong wrote in a tweet that showed a picture of him standing next to the Thai politician.\n\nThanathorn's Future Forward Party declined to comment when contacted by Reuters on Friday.\n\nThai army chief General Apirat Kongsompong indirectly criticized Thanathorn's meeting with Wong on Friday during a press briefing in which he accused opposition politicians of inappropriate behavior.\n\n\""Wong came to Thailand countless of times. To meet whom? The meetings had hidden agendas. Were they conspiring, cooking up something together?\"" Apirat said.\n\n\""And with the incidents in Hong Kong, someone went, to give moral support, to give encouragement,\"" Apirat added, showing the picture of Thanathorn and Wong that was posted on social media, though Thanathorn's body was blacked out.\n\nThailand was run by a military junta for five years after then-army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha overthrew an elected government.\n\nElections held in July were won by Prayuth's pro-army party in a vote that opposition parties said was organized to ensure the continuation of military control of politics.\n\nThe Thai Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the Chinese embassy's statement but referred to a statement in September stating that Thailand regards the situation in Hong Kong as China's internal affairs."

To mark the milestone in the promotion's history, ONE will be putting together a two-part fight card that features a handful of their biggest stars as well as a number of exciting prospects.\n\nOn that day, one of the Philippines' fastest rising stars steps into the biggest opportunity of his career, as Team Lakay's Danny \""The King\"" Kingad faces former long-time UFC Flyweight World Champion and American MMA icon Demetrious \""Mighty Mouse\"" Johnson in the finals of the ONE Flyweight World Grand Prix.\n\nThe winner takes home the ONE Flyweight World Grand Prix Championship, but most importantly, he gets a shot at the ONE Flyweight World Championship.\n\nThis is Danny Kingad's Road to ONE: CENTURY.\n\nAfter winning his first four professional bouts, Kingad made the jump to ONE Championship in 2016 and immediately put the division on notice, winning his debut by way of first-round TKO via ground and pound. He would follow that up with two more wins to improve his record to 7-0.\n\nThe impressive start was enough for him to earn a shot at the ONE Flyweight World Championship, held by Brazilian star Adriano Moraes.\n\nPerhaps pushed into the situation too quickly, the young Kingad succumbed to the more experienced Moraes and absorbed the first defeat of his young career.\n\nThe young Team Lakay standout bounced back in impressive fashion, stringing together three consecutive wins and then earning himself a shot at entering the ONE Flyweight World Grand Prix.\n\nIn his \""qualifying match\"" so to speak, Kingad bested Japanese grappler Tatsumitsu Wada to earn a spot in the eight-man flyweight tournament.\n\nIn his ONE Flyweight Grand Prix Quarterfinal match, Kingad outclassed Pancrase champion Senzo Ikeda in Tokyo to advance into the semifinals and move one step closer to the title.\n\nIn the semifinals, Kingad was originally slated to face former champion Kairat Akhmetov, but an injury forced the Kazakh to withdraw. Taking Akhmetov's place was former title challenger Reece McLaren.\n\nAgainst McLaren, Kingad was pushed to the limit, getting outgrappled in the first two rounds before rallying back and dominating the third round to sway the judges' decision to his favor and advance to the tournament finale.\n\nAs it fate would have it, Kingad would find himself matched up with an idol and an opponent he's wanted to face for a long time, Demetrious Johnson.\n\nThe American former champion also dominated his side of the bracket, setting up the must-see Final match.\n\nWhat's more is that Kingad will have the chance to showcase his talents on a much bigger audience, with his match against Johnson being the co-main event of ONE Century Part I, which will air on primetime television in the United States.\n\nCatch ONE: CENTURY in it's entirety on LIVESTREAMING on Sunday, October 13 starting at 8:00 AM (Part 1) and 4:00 PM (Part 2) via sports.abs-cbn.com/livestream/one and on iWant Sports as well as on the ABS-CBN Sports ENTITY Page and the ABS-CBN Sports YouTube Page!\n\nCatch ONE: CENTURY Part 2 LIVE at 6:30 PM on ABS-CBN S+A channel 23!\n\nONE: CENTURY Part 1 will air on Friday, October 18 at 8:30 PM on ABS-CBN S+A channel 23"

Epic is the most widely-used and comprehensive health records system in the country. The EHR implementation project started at AHS over three years ago as part of an effort to enhance care across the system, increase coordination of care, and improve the patient care experience.\n\n\We're committed to meeting the unique needs of our community and are very excited about the multiple benefits the new EHR system means for improved clinical efficiency, health management and patient care,\"" said Delvecchio Finley, CEO, Alameda Health System. \""Investing in this robust technology that equips our teams with a single electronic health record means that AHS will be able to deliver better integrated care, with added convenience, to our patients.\""\n\nWith the new EHR system, patients and their designated caregivers will have 24-hour access to their health record and comprehensive health history simply by using an app.\n\nOnce they have enrolled, AHS patients will gain access to Epic's patient portal, MyAlamedaHealth*, putting critical health data right at their fingertips. MyAlamedaHealth is expected to significantly streamline services by offering the ability to self-schedule appointments, send reminders about preventative screening and routine care, provide online access to request prescription refills, view lab and test results, pay bills and message their care team.\n\n\""To get a hold of my doctor I have to transfer through so many calls and then it takes some time for him to get the message and get back to me. This way I can contact him directly,\"" said patient J. Jose Franco. \""I'm really excited to enroll. I can't wait to see the results.\""\n\nHospital staff received extensive EHR training last month and will utilize the new system to streamline administrative tasks and facilitate the secure exchange of critical patient information and data to care teams at all AHS facilities or to any other health care provider patients choose.\n\nHaving implemented Epic, AHS now has the capacity to exchange data with other interoperable systems. This means that AHS can seamlessly share patient data, greatly enhancing care coordination and clinical decision-making, among providers which will improve the quality and safety of care as well as the patient experience. Providers will have the ability to coordinate care with clinicians outside of AHS who serve their patients and their families, closing care gaps and reducing duplication.\n\n\""Implementing this system is a foundational milestone to our health care delivery system with the aim to provide truly integrated, high quality, and safe care to our patients and community.

Facebook,0,"The best way to combat a \snake fish\"" is by cutting off its head.\n\nAn invasive Asian snakehead fish that can grow to almost a metre long and exist on land has surfaced in Georgia for the first time. Wildlife officials in the US state have formulated a foolproof animal control measure - killing it on sight.\n\nA denizen of China's Yangtze River basin, the northern snakehead was caught in a private pond in Gwinnett County northeast of Atlanta in early October, Georgia Department of Natural Resources officials announced on Wednesday.\n\nAn angler's report allowed them to \""confirm the presence\"" after identifying the fish's mottled brown colouring, a dorsal fin traversing the back and the serpentine noggin from which the fish takes its name.\n\n\""We are now taking steps to determine if they have spread from this water body and, hopefully, keep it from spreading to other Georgia waters,\"" said Matt Thomas, chief of fisheries for the DNR's Wildlife Resources Division.\n\nIt would be bad news if the fishy interloper spreads. The federally regulated snakehead is a voracious hunter with no natural predators in North America and has the potential to displace local wildlife by commandeering their food resources and habitat, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\n\nEven scarier, these serpentine swimmers can breathe air - allowing them to exist on land for days at a time.\n\nTo combat the invasion, Georgia's Wildlife Resources Division posted a notice on their ENTITY page, urging fishers to \""immediately kill and freeze any suspected snakeheads as well as snap photos of their quarry\"".\n\nAnglers should also note where it was caught - water body, GPS co-ordinates - and \""report their find to their regional Georgia DNR Wildlife Resources Division Fisheries Office\"".\n\nThe post sparked a flurry of remarks from the FB peanut gallery, most concerning the snakehead's purported deliciousness. Said one comment section gourmand, \""Just wondering if we have to cut the head off and leave them on the bank, or if we CAN take them home to eat?\""\n\nIndeed, the \""ferocious fish\"" is a staple of hotpot restaurants throughout China.\n\nBut for US wildlife officials, the snakehead scourge is no laughing matter. The species has already been reported in 14 states."

Facebook,1,"""WASHINGTON: Ahead of the annual Blueberry Festival in Marshall County, Indiana, in early September, a woman broadcast a warning to her neighbors on ENTITY.\n\n\""I just heard there's supposed to be a mass shooting tonight at the fireworks,\"" the woman, whose name is held to protect her privacy, said in a post in a private ENTITY Group with over 5,000 members.\n\n\""Probably just a rumor or kids trying to scare people, but everyone keep their eyes open,\"" she said in the post, which was later deleted.\n\nThere was no shooting at the Blueberry Festival that night, and the local police said there was no threat.\n\nBut the post sparked fear in the community, with some group members canceling their plans to attend, and shows the power of rumors in ENTITY Groups, which are often private or closed to outsiders. Groups allow community members to quickly spread information, and possibly misinformation, to users who trust the word of their neighbors.\n\nThese groups and other private features, rather than public feeds, are \""the future\"" of social media, ENTITY Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in April, revealing their importance to ENTITY's business model.\n\nThe threat of misinformation spreading rapidly in Groups shows a potential vulnerability in a key part of the company's growth strategy. It could push ENTITY to invest in expensive human content monitoring at the risk of limiting the ability to post in real-time, a central benefit of Groups and ENTITY in general that has attracted millions of users to the platform.\n\nWhen asked if ENTITY takes accountability for situations like the one in Indiana, a company spokeswoman said it is committed to maintaining groups as a safe place, and that it encourages people to contact law enforcement if they see a potential threat.\n\nENTITY Groups can also serve as a tool for connecting social communities around the world, such as ethnic groups, university alumni and hobbyists.\n\nENTITY's WhatsApp messaging platform faced similar but more serious problems in 2018 after false messages about child abductors led to mass beatings of more than a dozen people in India, some of whom have died. WhatsApp later limited message forwards and began labeling forwarded messages to quell the risk of fake news.\n\nFIREWORKS FEAR\n\nThe Blueberry Festival post caused chaos in the group, named \""Local News Now 2...(Marshall and all surrounding Counties).\""\n\nIn another post, which garnered over 100 comments of confusion and worry, a different member urged the woman to report the threat to the police.\n\n\""This isn't something to joke about or take lightly,\"" she wrote.\n\nThe author of the original post did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nENTITY's policy is to remove language that \""incites or facilitates serious violence,\"" the company spokeswoman said, adding that it did not remove the post and that it did not violate ENTITY's policies because there \""was no threat, praise or support of violence.\""\n\nCheryl Siddall, the founder of the Indiana group, said she would welcome tools from ENTITY to give her greater \""control\"" over what people post in the group, such as alerts to page moderators if posts contain certain words or phrases.\n\nBut Siddall said, \""I'm sorry, but that's a full-time job to sit and monitor everything that's going on in the page.\""\n\nPolice hunt for two armed with assault rifle in fatal shooting in Washington DC\n\nA ENTITY spokeswoman said page administrators have the ability to remove a post if it violates the group's proprietary rules and that administrators can pre-approve individual posts, as well as turn on post approvals for individual group members.\n\nIn a post to its blog, ENTITY urged administrators to write \""great group rules\"" to \""set the tone for your group and help prevent member conflict,\"" as well as \""provide a feeling of safety for group members.\""\n\nDavid Bacon, chief of police for the Plymouth Police Department in Marshall County, said the threat was investigated and traced back to an exaggerated rumor from children. Nonetheless, he said the post to the ENTITY group is \""what caused the whole problem.\""\n\n\""One post grows and people see it, and they take it as the gospel when in actuality you can throw anything you want out there,\"" Bacon said."

Patriotism and nationalism had strong underpinnings in his speech as he argued vehemently to \""take back our country\"".\n\nHe averred that it was time to end the endless wars giving examples of how US troops were in Syria for a decade while they have been in Afghanistan for 19 years. It was time to bring them home, he said.\n\nIn an emotional pitch, he added that it was hardest to sign letters to the families of the departed soldiers. Trump claimed that US has done its job, having defeated whoever they had to -- I do not want to stay in Syria.\n\nMaster of changing goal posts, Trump wanted Nancy Pelosi to help pass legislation rather than talk nonsense.

The said funds had been transferred by Religare Finvest to OSPL Infradeal without any approval and the entire documentation was done retrospectively three months after the actual transfer of funds.\n\nSimilarly, a corporate loan of Rs 50 crore was granted by Religare Finvest to another entity Bharat Road Network, which is related to the erstwhile promoters, without approval or documentation.\n\nLoans worth Rs 1,260.9 crore given by Religare Finvest to various entities were found to have allegedly landed in bank accounts of entities related to the Singh brothers.\n\nThe amounts are much smaller, but the modus operandi of alleged siphoning money from Fortis Healthcare, another company promoted by Singh brothers, is eerily similar. Here to SEBI asked Fortis Healthcare to recover Rs 403 crore with interest. Fortis Healthcare is now owned by Malaysia's IHH Healthcare.\n\nAfter their exit, the boards of REL and Religare Finvest were re-constituted with new directors. Singh brothers hold less than a percent in REL and they were reclassified as public shareholders from promoters.\n\nAll of this had nearly destroyed REL. As of March 31, Religare Finvest has made provisions on its entire corporate loan book of Rs 2,037 crore. The company suffered a loss of Rs 1,500 crore in FY19.\n\nUnder the new management the company has been trying to raise capital at the group and subsidiary level, which includes sale of its assets. It made some headway in July when it entered into a binding term sheet with TCG Advisory Services for sale of its entire stake in Religare Finvest and the latter's housing finance subsidiary: Religare Housing Development Finance Corporation (RHDFC).\n\nConsummation of the deal may take time given the regulatory hurdles. Meanwhile, the company has managed to service its liabilities. But given the challenging operating environment, how long it will do so is a big question.\n\nAlso, getting monies back from Singh brothers is a challenge.\n\nREL has already initiated recovery proceedings through a corporate insolvency resolution process under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016 against Singh brothers and their entities."

Ranbaxy,1,"If Handke's victory caused uncomfortable ripples, the choice of Tokarczuk was welcomed by liberal-minded authors\n\nNobel Prizes for literature were awarded Thursday to two writers enmeshed in Europe's social and political fault lines: a liberal Pole who has irked her country's conservative government and an Austrian accused by many liberals of being an apologist for Serbian war crimes.\n\nThe rare double announcement - with the 2018 prize going to Poland's Olga Tokarczuk and the 2019 award to Austria's Peter Handke - came after no literature prize was awarded last year due to sex abuse allegations that rocked the Swedish Academy, which awards the literature prize.\n\nYet if prize organizers hoped to get through this year's awards without controversy, they will likely be disappointed.\n\nThe Swedish Academy called Handke \one of the most influential writers in Europe\"" and praised his work for exploring \""the periphery and the specificity of human experience.\""\n\nBut the 76-year-old author has long faced criticism for his vigorous defense of the Serbs during the 1990s wars that devastated the Balkans as Yugoslavia disintegrated. He spoke at the 2006 funeral of former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, who at the time was facing war crimes charges, calling him \""a rather tragic man.\""\n\nHandke - who once called for the Nobel Prize to be abolished - said he was \""astonished\"" to receive the literature award.\n\n\""I never thought they would choose me,\"" Handke told reporters outside his home in suburban Paris.\n\n\""It was very courageous by the Swedish academy, this kind of decision,\"" he added. \""These are good people.\""\n\nIf Handke's victory caused uncomfortable ripples, the choice of Tokarczuk was welcomed by liberal-minded authors and readers in her native Poland and beyond.\n\nThe 57-year-old novelist, known for her humanist themes and playful, subversive streak, has often irked Poland's populists and conservatives. The academy said she was chosen for works that explore the \""crossing of boundaries as a form of life.\""\n\nAlready a major cultural figure in Poland, Tokarczuk has a growing international profile, especially since she won the Booker International prize in 2018 for the novel \""Flights.\""\n\nShe told Polish broadcaster TVN on Thursday that she was \""terribly happy and proud\"" that her novels, which describe events in small towns in Poland \""can be read as universal and can be important for people around the world.\""\n\nHandke has been a big name in European literature for decades, crafting works - starting with his first novel, \""The Hornets,\"" in 1966 - that combine introspection and a provocative streak. One early play was called \""Offending the Audience\"" and featured actors insulting theatergoers.\n\nHe has written screenplays, several of them for German director Wim Wenders, who also filmed Handke's 1970 novel, \""The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick.\""\n\nHe was praised by the Swedish Academy for writing powerfully about catastrophe, notably in \""A Sorrow Beyond Dreams,\"" his 1972 autobiographical novel about his mother's suicide.\n\nBut his staunch support of the Serbs during the 1990s Balkans wars has set him at odds with many other Western intellectuals.\n\nIn a 1996 essay, \""Justice for Serbia,\"" Handke accused Western news media of always depicting Serbs as aggressors. He denied that genocide was committed when Bosnian Serb troops massacred some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys in the enclave of Srebrenica in 1995, and was an opponent of NATO's airstrikes against Serbia for that country's violent crackdown in Kosovo in the late 1990s. In an interview with Serbia's state TV earlier this year, Handke said those behind the bombing \""don't belong to Europe and the planet Earth.\""\n\nHandke's views led novelist Salman Rushdie in 1999 to call him a contender for \""International Moron of the Year.\"" Rushdie's publicist at Penguin Random House said Thursday that Rushdie stood by what he wrote in 1999.\n\nNovelist Jennifer Egan, president of PEN America, said the writers' group deeply regretted the choice of Handke.\n\n\""We are dumbfounded by the selection of a writer who has used his public voice to undercut historical truth and offer public succor to perpetrators of genocide,\"" she said. \""At a moment of rising nationalism, autocratic leadership, and widespread disinformation around the world, the literary community deserves better than this.\""\n\nIn 2006, Handke turned down the Heinrich Heine award from the German city of Duesseldorf after his selection sparked a row among the city's politicians. His selection as winner of the International Ibsen Award for drama in 2014 also prompted protests from human rights groups.\n\nThat same year, he told the Austrian Press Agency that the Nobel Prize should be abolished because of its \""false canonization\"" of literature.\n\nSerbian officials and media hailed Handke on Thursday as a \""great friend of Serbia,\"" but Kosovans reacted angrily to his Nobel Prize. Vlora Citaku, Kosovo's ambassador to the United States, tweeted that \""In a world full of brilliant writers, the Nobel committee chooses to reward a propagator of ethnic hatred & violence. Something has gone terribly wrong!\""\n\nAlbanian Foreign Minister Gent Cakaj, who was born in Kosovo, tweeted that the award was \""an ignoble & shameful act.\""\n\nIn contrast, the win by Tokarczuk - Poland's fifth Nobel literature laureate - was greeted with praise even by her erstwhile critics.\n\nTokarcuzk has been attacked by Polish conservatives - and received death threats - for criticizing aspects of the country's past, including its episodes of anti-Semitism. She is also a strong critic of Poland's current right-wing government.\n\nHer 2014 novel \""The Books of Jacob\"" tackles the forced conversion of Polish Jews to Catholicism in the 18th century. Her book \""Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead\"" is a crime thriller with feminist and animal-rights themes that offers a sometimes unflattering depiction of small-town Polish life.\n\nCulture Minister Piotr Glinski, who said earlier this week that he has not finished any of Tokarczuk's books, tweeted his congratulations and said he now felt obliged to go back and read her books all the way through.\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda called it a \""great day for Polish literature.\""\n\nTokarczuk is only the 15th woman to win the Nobel literature prize in more than a century. Of the 11 Nobels awarded so far this week, all the other laureates have been men.\n\nBoth literature winners will receive a full cash prize, valued this year at 9 million kronor ($918,000), a gold medal and a diploma at a ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10.\n\nThe literature prize was canceled last year after an exodus of members from the exclusive Swedish Academy following sex abuse allegations. Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of a former academy member, was convicted last year of two rapes in 2011.\n\nThe Nobel Foundation had warned that another group would award the literature prize if the academy didn't improve its tarnished image, but said in March it was satisfied the Swedish Academy had revamped itself and restored trust.\n\nThe 2018 and 2019 awards were chosen by the Swedish Academy's Nobel Committee, a new body made up of four academy members and five \""external specialists.\"" Nobel organizers say the committee suggests two names that then must be approved by the Swedish Academy. It's unclear whether academy members simply rubber-stamped the experts' choice.\n\nThe literature awards follow Nobel Prizes in physics, chemistry and medicine handed out earlier this week. The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday and the economics award on Monday.\n\nALSO READ | 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to Austrian author Peter Handke\n\nALSO READ | A year late, 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to Polish author Olga Tokarczuk\n\nALSO READ | Two Nobel Prizes in Literature were announced this year.

Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""WASHINGTON: Ahead of the annual Blueberry Festival in Marshall County, Indiana, in early September, a woman broadcast a warning to her neighbors on Facebook.\n\n\""I just heard there's supposed to be a mass shooting tonight at the fireworks,\"" the woman, whose name is held to protect her privacy, said in a post in a private Facebook Group with over 5,000 members.\n\n\""Probably just a rumor or kids trying to scare people, but everyone keep their eyes open,\"" she said in the post, which was later deleted.\n\nThere was no shooting at the Blueberry Festival that night, and the local police said there was no threat.\n\nBut the post sparked fear in the community, with some group members canceling their plans to attend, and shows the power of rumors in Facebook Groups, which are often private or closed to outsiders. Groups allow community members to quickly spread information, and possibly misinformation, to users who trust the word of their neighbors.\n\nThese groups and other private features, rather than public feeds, are \""the future\"" of social media, Facebook Chief Executive ENTITY said in April, revealing their importance to Facebook's business model.\n\nThe threat of misinformation spreading rapidly in Groups shows a potential vulnerability in a key part of the company's growth strategy. It could push Facebook to invest in expensive human content monitoring at the risk of limiting the ability to post in real-time, a central benefit of Groups and Facebook in general that has attracted millions of users to the platform.\n\nWhen asked if Facebook takes accountability for situations like the one in Indiana, a company spokeswoman said it is committed to maintaining groups as a safe place, and that it encourages people to contact law enforcement if they see a potential threat.\n\nFacebook Groups can also serve as a tool for connecting social communities around the world, such as ethnic groups, university alumni and hobbyists.\n\nFacebook's WhatsApp messaging platform faced similar but more serious problems in 2018 after false messages about child abductors led to mass beatings of more than a dozen people in India, some of whom have died. WhatsApp later limited message forwards and began labeling forwarded messages to quell the risk of fake news.\n\nFIREWORKS FEAR\n\nThe Blueberry Festival post caused chaos in the group, named \""Local News Now 2...(Marshall and all surrounding Counties).\""\n\nIn another post, which garnered over 100 comments of confusion and worry, a different member urged the woman to report the threat to the police.\n\n\""This isn't something to joke about or take lightly,\"" she wrote.\n\nThe author of the original post did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nFacebook's policy is to remove language that \""incites or facilitates serious violence,\"" the company spokeswoman said, adding that it did not remove the post and that it did not violate Facebook's policies because there \""was no threat, praise or support of violence.\""\n\nCheryl Siddall, the founder of the Indiana group, said she would welcome tools from Facebook to give her greater \""control\"" over what people post in the group, such as alerts to page moderators if posts contain certain words or phrases.\n\nBut Siddall said, \""I'm sorry, but that's a full-time job to sit and monitor everything that's going on in the page.\""\n\nPolice hunt for two armed with assault rifle in fatal shooting in Washington DC\n\nA Facebook spokeswoman said page administrators have the ability to remove a post if it violates the group's proprietary rules and that administrators can pre-approve individual posts, as well as turn on post approvals for individual group members.\n\nIn a post to its blog, Facebook urged administrators to write \""great group rules\"" to \""set the tone for your group and help prevent member conflict,\"" as well as \""provide a feeling of safety for group members.\""\n\nDavid Bacon, chief of police for the Plymouth Police Department in Marshall County, said the threat was investigated and traced back to an exaggerated rumor from children. Nonetheless, he said the post to the Facebook group is \""what caused the whole problem.\""\n\n\""One post grows and people see it, and they take it as the gospel when in actuality you can throw anything you want out there,\"" Bacon said."
Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""The results are in. The Trump tax cuts resulted in most families saving so little that majorities continue to insist they see no difference in their paychecks.

Both Sanders and Warren are proposing not just significantly increased taxes on wealth, but crackdowns on big-money influence in politics and big-businesses power over all of us. On Monday morning alone, Sanders, still off the campaign trail while he recovers from a heart attack he suffered last week, called for banning all corporate contributions to funding the Democratic National Convention and presidential inauguration events, while limiting individual donations to $500 for the latter. As Sanders pointed out, Facebook and a number of other companies gave more than $1 million to the party's 2016 convention.\n\nAs for Trump's 2017 inauguration, it smashed records at $106 million. Also Monday morning, Warren released a plan to end financial conflicts of interest among the judiciary, a complement to other proposals to crack down on corporate lobbying and overall government and business corruption. Both senators have said they will crack down on private equity and break up Facebook.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, short-term shareholder value became the be-all and end-all, something that almost certainly not so coincidentally befitted the people in charge, who received the bulk of their ever increasing pay in that form. (Yes, Sanders has a plan to fight that, too.) That money allowed them an ever greater influence in our culture, economy and politics, celebrated as people of unique genius and insight. It's a selfish, shortsighted way of thinking but one that's been ascendant for the better part of 40 years. The result? Those Trump tax cuts.\n\nWhile it's understandable that someone with few or no dollars to spare will ponder which candidate is better for their personal finances, it's reprehensible that this is the position of these wealthy whiners. They'll be fine with less in their bank accounts or even one or two fewer zeros off their net worth statement. They can afford to think about the moral and long-range implications of their choice. What should concern them is a would-be strongman in the White House. Unstable, boastful, erratic ignorant rulers are not a sign of a country climbing to greater heights but of one descending to ever deeper depths.\n\nBe the first to know - Sign up for News Alerts\n\nWe'll send breaking news and news alerts to your inbox as they happen!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""Facebook CEO ENTITY will appear before Congress this month as the tech giant is under pressure from lawmakers and regulators over its massive market power and record of privacy breaches.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, the California Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee, announced Wednesday that Mr. Zuckerberg will testify at a hearing by the panel on Oct. 23. The focus will be on Facebook's plan to create a digital currency and its role in housing. The company agreed in a legal settlement in March to overhaul its ad-targeting systems to prevent discrimination in housing, credit, and employment ads.\n\nLawmakers from both parties and top regulators, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, have criticized Facebook's plan for the new currency, expressing concern that it could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking. There also is concern that the massive reserve created with money used to buy the new currency, to be called Libra, could supplant the Fed and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.\n\n\""Mark looks forward to testifying before the House Financial Services Committee and responding to lawmakers' questions,\"" Facebook said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nIn July, Ms. Waters and other committee Democrats sent a letter to Facebook requesting a halt on moving forward with the currency and with the digital wallet, called Calibra, which would be used in the new currency system. House Democrats also have threatened legislation that would block big tech companies from getting into banking.\n\nMs. Waters has called Libra \""a new Swiss-based financial system\"" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.\n\nFrance's finance minister said Wednesday that the European Union should not allow Facebook to develop the currency project on \""European territory\"" because it threatens the monetary sovereignty of member countries. \""It should not be the role of a private company to try to get a sovereign currency like a sovereign state,\"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.\n\nUnlike digital currencies such as bitcoin or Ethereum, Facebook's plan calls for Libra to be backed by real currencies.\n\nDavid Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, told lawmakers over two days of congressional hearings in July that Facebook would not launch the currency project until it had received all the necessary approvals from regulators and secured safeguards to protect the privacy of users' data. He said Facebook will not control Libra because Facebook will be only one of about 100 companies and nonprofits in an association that will manage the currency.\n\nThe plan would open low-cost online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts, and would make it cheaper to send money across borders, Mr. Marcus said. He did not agree to a suspension of the plan or a pilot project, as several lawmakers urged.\n\nFacebook, a social media giant based in Menlo Park, California, with nearly 2.5 billion users around the globe, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of data privacy scandals, including lapses in opening the personal data of millions of users to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nThe Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission, and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting investigations of Facebook and the other big tech companies amid accusations of abuse of their market power to crush competition.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg had three days of private meetings in Washington last month with Mr. Trump and several lawmakers who, like the president, are critics of the tech industry. He also met with the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee to discuss ways to prevent foreign actors from disrupting next year's elections. In a separate session, Mr. Zuckerberg told the leaders of the House Judiciary Committee that the company would cooperate with their antitrust investigation.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg last testified to Congress in the spring, when he was questioned about privacy, election interference, and other issues."
Mark Zuckerberg,1,"""Jesse Eisenberg and Alexander Skarsgård star in The Hummingbird Project.\n\nWith The Hummingbird Project, Canadian writer-director Kim Nguyen has created possibly the first stock market fraud thriller to be set predominantly in a rural environment. Nguyen, who was previously nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar for War Witch, assembles a relatively prestigious cast for a low-budget film of this nature, including Jesse Eisenberg, Alexander Skarsgård, Salma Hayek, and Better Call Saul's Michael Mando. The film concerns two Russian-American cousins, Vincent (Eisenberg) and Anton Zaleski (a heavily de-prettified Skarsgård) who work as ultra-high-speed commodities traders at a brokerage owned and run by Eva Torres (Hayek). Vincent decides to leave the brokerage to build a pipeline that will transfer trading data from Kansas to New York City within 16 milliseconds (the amount of time it takes a hummingbird to flap its wing), rather than the 17 milliseconds currently possible.\n\nHe believes that he will be able to get rich by having this technological advantage over other brokerages and enlists the technically more gifted but interpersonally less advanced Anton in his venture, convincing him to leave his job to join him in the venture also. The pair get funding for the pipeline from semi-corrupt financier Bryan Taylor (Frank Schorpion) and head out to Pennsylvania to oversee its construction, Anton concentrating on its coding and Vincent overseeing the project management with the assistance of engineer Mark Vega (Mando). However, they incur the wrath of Torres, who vows to wreck the project in retribution for what she sees as an act of betrayal by two employees who are using skills they developed under her tutelage to jeopardise her business and line their own pockets.\n\nWhilst the film is akin to films like Wall Street, The Wolf of Wall Street, and Margin Call in generic terms, in terms of narrative and character development, it is more like Bullitt, Dirty Harry, or one of Michael Mann's cop thrillers. This is because it portrays characters who are so resolute and single-minded in terms of their dedication to accomplishment of a professional goal(s) that a terrible toll is exacted upon their personal lives and personal relationships. Eisenberg brings the same sort of borderline psychopathic geekery to his character that he brought to his performance as Facebook founder ENTITY in David Fincher's The Social Network. Skarsgård is cast effectively against type as a nebbishy, bullied, possibly autistic coding genius, and Hayek is effective as a ruthless businesswoman.\n\nNguyen directs at a pace that keeps the viewer engaged, with Quebec and Ontario doubling for the Pennsylvanian countryside credibly. He manages to generate unexpected humour from Anton's personality traits and the starkness of the film's setting reflects the ever-diminishing likelihood of him and Vincent achieving the gargantuan, unreachable goal they have set for themselves. The film is not as entertaining as The Wolf of Wall Street, as dramatic as Wall Street, or as funny as The Big Short, but it does convincingly depict the conflicts between the over-arching ambitions of a Type A personality and the introverted technical genius of a Type B personality that manipulation of the financial markets can entail. The Hummingbird Project is available to download and stream now."
Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""It can be hard to remember from this side of a successful foreign intervention in a US presidential election, but in April 2016, ENTITY was widely praised when he spoke out - however obliquely - against Donald Trump's then longshot presidential candidacy.\n\n\""I'm starting to see people and nations turning inward against this idea of a connected world,\"" the Facebook chief executive said in a speech. \""I hear fearful voices talking about building walls ... It takes courage to choose hope over fear.\""\n\nThree and a half years later, another US presidential campaign is well under way and courage is not exactly thick on the ground at Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park. For the past few weeks, the company has been embroiled in a slow-motion scandal over its inexplicable policies on political misinformation, one that epitomizes the kind of moral cowardice that characterizes Facebook's approach to its political challenges.\n\nThe controversy kicked off last month when the Facebook executive Nick Clegg revealed in a speech that politicians are exempt from the company's third-party fact-checking program. The policy drew immediate scrutiny due to the distinctly dystopian context in which the speech was made: just as the president of the United States was actively promoting misinformation on Facebook to smear a political rival and undermine an impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump's Facebook page has launched 5,883 different ads since news of the Ukraine-call whistleblower broke on 18 September, 40% of which mention impeachment, according to a Guardian analysis of the Facebook political ad archive. The Trump campaign has spent between $1.3m and $3.8m promoting the impeachment ads, which had been viewed between 26.5m and 43.9m times, as of Wednesday. (The ad archive reports spending and impression data as a range.)\n\nMost of the ads employ the Trump campaign's usual brand of rhetoric: railing against the Democratic \""witch-hunt\"" and \""fake news\"" media; singling out non-white politicians for attacks (the Texas congressman Al Green is referred to in one set as \""Low-IQ\""); and encouraging a sense of grievance while seeking donations (\""They want to take YOUR VOTE away\"").\n\nBut one of the ads has caused particular concern because it is blatantly misleading. The 30-second video falsely claims that Joe Biden \""promised Ukraine a billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son's company\"". It uses audio of Biden speaking loosely of his role in Barack Obama's foreign policy - \""If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money,\"" he says, \""Well, son of a bitch, he got fired\"" - to create the impression that Biden admitted to extorting Ukraine on behalf of his son. CNN declined to run the ad, saying: \""In addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.\""\n\nFacebook's insistence on protecting Trump's right to mislead the public and distort verifiable facts is a strange look for a company that attempted to burnish its reputation post-Russian interference with an ad campaign declaring \""Fake news is not your friend\"". And attempts by the company to justify the decision are nearly impossible to parse.\n\nIn a letter to the Biden campaign, which complained about the Trump ad, Facebook's elections policy director, Katie Harbath, invoked \""Facebook's fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is\"". She then explained that if a politician shared a link to a viral hoax written by someone else, that post would be rejected as an advertisement, but if the same politician wrote the viral hoax in his own words, that would not only be fine, but Facebook would not allow third-party fact checkers to flag the information as false.\n\nWhen I asked Facebook whether this new rule would also exempt politicians who promote vaccine misinformation, which is explicitly barred from advertisements, a company spokeswoman said that it would not. If your head is spinning, you are not alone. These rules do not make any sense.\n\nWhat's even more absurd is that Facebook actually did take action against the ads, just for a different reason. As I reported on 2 October, the Biden ads were briefly blocked for violating Facebook's policy against profanity. (After the Trump campaign bleeped \""son of a bitch\"", they were allowed to run again.)\n\nWhy does Facebook's fundamental belief in free expression privilege the right of a politician to lie but not to use a swear word?\n\nIt has been tempting for some to ascribe Facebook's motives here to economic self-interest. The Trump campaign is a major advertiser on Facebook, after all, much larger than the Biden campaign.\n\nBut I suspect that this incident has less to do with revenues and more to do with Zuckerberg's fundamental political programming, which defaults to protecting incumbent power above all else.\n\nWas it really an act of \""courage\"" for Zuckerberg to criticize Trump's xenophobia in April 2016, when a Hillary Clinton coronation appeared assured?\n\nOver and over again, Zuckerberg and Facebook have failed to take action to prevent real and lasting harm, when that action involved challenging the status quo or state power. This was demonstrated most devastatingly by its unwillingness to rein in Myanmar's military until after a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya had already been accomplished, as well as in its foot-dragging on banning white nationalism. This predilection for the powerful is how Zuckerberg went from calling out Trump on building walls to an Oval Office grip and grin.\n\nWe are living in an age when everyone from cheap furniture makers to video game publishers is being forced to pick sides in serious struggles between business and barbarism, between authoritarianism and democracy. That Zuckerberg refuses to do so reveals whose side he's really on.\n\nWelcome to Dispatches from Silicon Valley, a new weekly column from me, Guardian US technology reporter Julia Carrie Wong.

Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.)\n\nChris Orban, The Ohio State University\n\n(THE CONVERSATION) In 2013, a who's who of the tech world came together to launch a newnonprofit called Code.org. The purpose of the organization was to get more computer science into schools.\n\nBillionaires like ENTITY and Bill Gatesdonated millions of dollars to the group. According to the organization's last annual report, Code.org spent more than US$91 million between 2013 and 2018. Of that amount, $6.9 million went to advocate for state legislation across the country.\n\nAs part of the organization's mission to \""make computer science count\"" in K-12 education, code.org takes credit for having influenced graduation policies in 42 states. Today, 47 states and the District of Columbia allow computer science classes to count in place of math classes like Algebra 2. Prior to the organization's work, only a few states allowed computer science to count for math credit.\n\nIn addition, 29 states passed legislation allowing computer science to count in place of a science course. When computer science begins to count as math or science, it makes sense to ask if these changes are helping America's students or hurting them.\n\nIs this a good idea?\n\nAs a computational physicist and education researcher who teaches college freshman introductory physics, I worry that allowing computer science to count as a required math or science course could make students substantially less prepared for college. I searched around for research on this topic and asked several colleagues but came up empty-handed. I also worry that a lack of math and science preparation in high school could artificially narrow the range of options for students who might otherwise have promising STEM careers.\n\nCertainly, computer science is important to teach in high school. I lead an effort called the STEMcoding Project where I have trained a few dozen high school math and science teachers to integrate coding into math and science, and I have worked with a few high school computer science teachers to integrate more science and math into their curriculum.\n\nI began working on the STEMcoding Project in 2016 after getting frustrated by how many undergrads and even graduate students came to my office wanting to be mentored on a computational physics research projects despite having no prior experience with programming.\n\nWhen I consider computer science in schools, I want to know: What kind of computer science, how rigorous is the content, and what ends up being removed to make room for it? Although there areexceptions, most high school computer science curricula that I have seen have been light on math and science.\n\nI worry that students may take computer science just to avoid the more difficult math and science courses they need for college. Computer science could be a way for students to circumvent graduation requirements while adults look the other way.\n\nOthers are concerned, too. In response to these trends, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics called in 2016 and as recently as 2018 for math classes to count as math only when they are \""designed explicitly to teach mathematics.\""\n\nCareer preparation\n\nComputer science can be a practical class that helps prepare students for real middle-class jobs. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis expressed similar ideas when he signed a workforce education bill into law earlier this year that allows computer science to count as math or science.\n\n\""Other than trying to keep my kids from falling down the stairs in the Governor's mansion I don't know how much I deal with physics daily,\"" the governor said. But he said it's different when it comes to computer science. \""You cannot live in our modern society without dealing with technology or computers in your daily life,\"" he added.\n\n× You have run out of free stories.

Despite a surge in the number of students taking computer science in college, there is still far more demand for computer science and software engineering workers than there is supply.\n\nPerhaps because of this demand the salaries for computer science jobs are estimated to beas much as 40% more than jobs in other fields.\n\nAre important math skills lost?\n\nDespite these arguments there are still good reasons to question computer science substitution policies like the one deSantis signed. Being a modern electrician, for example, requires some understanding of algebra and trigonometry.\n\nEven for those who plan to study computer science, taking Algebra 2 and above is highly recommended. Algebra 2 and other advanced math courses are also important for engineering.\n\nSome studies estimate that a remarkable 40% of college freshmen in the U.S. require remedial math courses. That portion could go up if fewer students are taking a traditional math sequence in high school.\n\nTaking remedial math courses like Algebra 2 in college requires students to spend more time and money than they would if they just took and passed four years of math in high school. According to one study, only about half of all students who take remedial math ever complete it. So skipping Algebra 2 in high school could end up stopping many students from graduating from college at all.\n\nA matter of choice\n\nPerhaps in weighing these concerns, of the 47 states that do allow computer science to count in place of math, 13 leave it to individual districts to decide whether to let students exercise that option. The list of 13 includes tech savvy states like New York and California.\n\nIn a majority of U.S. states, students and families now have a serious choice to make. Students can take a nontraditional route and replace courses like Algebra 2 and physics with computer science, taking their chances that this won't come back to bite them later. Or they can stick with a more traditional curriculum, with its traditional advantages and disadvantages.\n\nAs computer science substitution policies become more widely utilized, I plan to research whether or not these CS substitution policies help more than they hurt.\n\nWe especially need to understand how this flexibility affects women and students from underrepresented groups. Computer science advocates have created a kind of national experiment. The next few years will show if this was a good idea, but only if we're looking at more than just the numbers of students taking computer science.\n\n[ Like what you've read? Want more?

Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""It's our third Vergecast of the week, and it's time to recap what happened in the tech world. First up, Silicon Valley editor Casey Newton starts the show by explaining what we heard candidly from Facebook CEO ENTITY in leaked audio of an internal Facebook Q&A. The Vergecast explains what Zuckerberg's comments say about Facebook's unique place in the antitrust debate.\n\nNext, Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Paul Miller run through everything that was announced at Microsoft's Surface event this week, including some new foldable devices and Microsoft's partnership with Android. Will the folding form factor stand the test of time?\n\nWe've also got updates on the fight for net neutrality. An appeals court this week upheld the Federal Communications Commission's repeal of net neutrality laws, but it vacated a rule that would prevent states from passing their own versions of the laws. You can hear Nilay colorfully explain this court ruling on this episode.\n\nThere's a whole lot in between all of that -- including Paul Miller's weekly segment \""I've seen The Matrix. I'm not an idiot.\"" -- so listen through to get it all."
Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""A keen understanding of the way our brain functions is essential to building sustainable routines and habits that set us up for success, says Jay Kumar Hariharan.\n\n'Preventing decision fatigue is also one of the reasons past President Barack Obama and ENTITY do not change their wardrobe often,' says Photograph: Jim Young/Reuters\n\nBuilding a leadership brand is probably the most important investment a C-Suite member needs to make.\n\nBeing on top of your functional capability is the bare minimum and will get you a ticket, but for you to get some skin in the game when the air gets thinner and the competition fiercer, branding is the only way that will set you apart.\n\nTrue personal branding starts within and gets communicated outward.\n\nLike all great brands, great leaders are great learners; they are constantly learning about themselves, their environment and their interaction with the external environment.\n\nThey consistently work on understanding more about their leadership style and ensure they are communicating with clarity what their leadership style is about.\n\nAs a fundamental premise, branding seeks to establish and occupy a distinct place in our minds for a product or service. As leaders, we have an opportunity to positively affect lives and influence stakeholders with our unique style and personal branding is what will set us up to influence and succeed. Constant engagement using direct conversations, humility, powerful questioning and enquiry, will help us be more aware of our needs, values, norms and beliefs as leaders.\n\nThis sense of awareness helps us to craft meaningful interactions with our stakeholders.\n\nMilestones on the journey to reinventing your leadership brand\n\nA man with a strong why can handle any how: Nietsche\n\nStart with why.\n\nStarting with why is a great strategy.\n\nWhy do you need to reinvent yourself? What would you want the future 'You' to be?\n\nHow will this change help you reach your goals? What do these changes mean to you?\n\nHow will they add to the richness of your life?\n\nAdd as many references as possible to answer the question 'Why'.\n\nThink of each reference as one string -- the more strings you weave together, the stronger and clearer the new avatar.\n\nNeuroplasticity is the fascinating thing that happens in your brain every time you practice or think of something.\n\nNeurons get bonded together, like the string getting strengthened.\n\nEveryone stands in awe of what is rightly called the 'three-pound universe', with its 100 billion nerve cells that form anywhere between a trillion to quadrillion connections (synapses). These connections are in a constant state of shape-shifting and remodeling, sections of the brain being physically changed by adding neural threads.\n\nThe posterior hippocampus, the area of the brain known to be important for memory, is bigger in London taxi drivers than in most people.\n\nThe examination to be a London cabby is possibly the most difficult test in the world, demanding years of study to memorize the city's labyrinth of 25,000 streets, and the businesses and landmarks on them. Of course, Google maps has rendered this practice non-essential, just like we are rapidly losing our ability to handle complex numbers in our head.\n\nBring to the surface all those niggling observations about your own quirks, mindsets etc, and expose them to sunlight to answer your Big Why question. You will get an answer that may constantly evolve and that's alright. But answering the Big Why is fundamental to this journey.\n\nWhy are chocolates sold at supermarket checkout counters?\n\nWhat can we learn from Barack Obama and ENTITY's sartorial choices?\n\nLet us step into Neuroscience to understand how the brain interprets data.\n\nThere are two operating systems in the brain -- the rational, conscious part of the brain that evolved later, as part of the neo cortex, and the reptilian or limbic brain, a remnant of our prehistoric past.\n\nWhile the rational brain has always been considered the main protagonist, the real hero or villain, as the case may be, is the limbic or reptilean brain. This operating system adopts shortcuts to understand something faster, which is why symbols, metaphors and acronyms work harder.\n\nThere is something unique about the brain. It weighs about 2% of our body weight, but consumes 20% of our energy. Sense and decision-making consumes a lot of energy. And when you are low on energy, your body immediately craves for a sugar hit.\n\nWhen you are in the supermarket, walking down the aisles, you are making decisions. There are at least 60 brands of toilet paper and 125 brands of bottled water in the US alone. This is one of the reasons chocolates are sold at the counter.\n\nTo give you the sugar fix you need.\n\nPreventing decision fatigue is also one of the reasons past President Barack Obama and ENTITY do not change their wardrobe often, and I quote Obama here: \""I have many decisions to make. I can't squander that energy in figuring out my wardrobe or breakfast.\""\n\nFor example, if we hear about a con man taking advantage of a kind elderly widow, we might feel disgust. But the disgust doesn't come from a special moral centre; instead, our outrage happens in the insula, the same part of the brain that handles disgust about rotten food and faeces.\n\nSo evolution 'retrofitted' the insula to do a much wider range of functions than it originally did, including allowing us to experience moral disgust.\n\nMany of our complicated moral and psychological responses have their roots in basic parts of the brain. As a consequence, the literal and the metaphorical happen in the same place.\n\nSapolsky shares some examples: In a remarkable study, ChenBo Zhong of the University of Toronto, and Katie Liljenquist of NorthwesternUniversity, demonstrated how the brain has trouble distinguishing between being a dirty scoundrel and being in need of a bath.\n\nVolunteers were asked to recall either a moral or immoral act in their past. Afterward, as a token of appreciation, Zhong and Liljenquist offered the volunteers a choice between the gift of a pencil or a package of antiseptic wipes. And the folks who had just wallowed in their ethical failures went for the wipes.\n\nIn the next study, volunteers were told to recall an immoral act they had committed.\n\nAfterward, subjects either did or did not have the opportunity to clean their hands. Those who were able to wash were less likely to respond to a request for help (set up by the experimenters).\n\nLady Macbeth washing her hands also seems to support this.\n\nTrue leaders develop a deep understanding of themselves to begin with and then an understanding of how they are perceived.\n\nWhen I coach CXOs, I hear them say things like, 'I am perceived to be a hard taskmaster who doesn't empathize with my subordinates, but that's not who I am. That is just perception.'\n\nWell, if three people say you snort like a horse, do buy a saddle!\n\nLeadership is a contact sport and perception is reality. Your stakeholders are drawing a picture based on all the emotions you trigger in them, to slot you as a particular brand of leader and this thin slicing is instantaneous.\n\n***\n\nA recent study showed that individuals will pair names such as 'Molly' with round silhouettes, and names such as 'Kate' with sharp silhouettes.\n\nMoreover, individuals associate different personality traits with either group of names (e.g. easy going with 'round names'; determination with 'sharp names'), suggesting influencers in abstract concepts.\n\nRamachandran and Hubbard suggest the Kiki/Bouba effect has implications in the evolution of language, because it suggests that names are not arbitrary.\n\nI use this as an exercise with my coaches, and they too, intuitively say answer in the same way, landing in the 95%. Then there is also an 'aha' moment when I ask them what they think their leadership style?\n\nKiki or Bouba? This helps them understand the deeprootedness of perception.\n\nLet's borrow a thought from Prahlad Kakkar, who posed this question while speaking at a conference: \""Who is the first brand manager you met in your life?\""\n\nPeople started yelling out names. After a moment he gently suggested their parents had been their first brand managers.\n\nIt began when they named their babies Vikram, Ajay, Sweetie...whatever the case.\n\nThis quote from Maya Angelou rings true not just for its warmth and simplicity, but also because it is moored in Neuroscience: \""I've learned that people will forget what you said; people will forget what you did; but people will never forget how you made them feel.\""\n\nEach time we engage in a different behaviour, we are accessing a part of the brain and neural strands are getting together to elicit a certain reward in a cycle of Cue-Routine-Reward.\n\nOver time, the neural strands thicken and we can access the same emotional state easily, which is why a careful scan for triggers and cues from the external environment is essential in our war against bad habits.\n\nA keen understanding of the way our brain functions is essential to building sustainable routines and habits that set us up for success, mapping our paths as successful leaders in the work place, and as human beings in the larger world.\n\nExcerpted from Rewire: How To Be The Leader Of Your Own Life by Jay Kumar Hariharan with the kind permission of the publishers, Leadstart."
Mark Zuckerberg,1,"""Next Tuesday, ENTITY will take the stage to give his annual opening keynote address at Facebook's F8 developer conference. In the wake of months of privacy- and security-related controversies that culminated in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it will be one of the most important public appearances of his life.\n\nThe same was said about Zuckerberg's appearances earlier this month on Capitol Hill. But while the senators and representatives who grilled him for 10 hours have the power to regulate Facebook-though no consensus on a solution-next week's talk will let Zuckerberg directly address the developers in the room as well as users, investors, and others following his speech from afar. So the stakes, as Facebook aims to navigate the winding fjords of potential regulation, jittery shareholders, and the #DeleteFacebook movement could hardly be higher.\n\nTraditionally, of course, F8 is a Facebook lovefest, with Zuckerberg and a conga line of other executives taking the keynote stage to unveil one new product, feature, or technology after another. Last year, for example, the company rolled out an augmented-reality camera system, new social VR features, music and games in Messenger, new Messenger bot features, professional-quality VR cameras, and even a futuristic approach to hearing through skin.\n\nFacebook will certainly make numerous product and feature announcements this year. But they will likely be smaller and more measured. Big reveals like the company's rumored smart speakers are surely being delayed, as will be any other major products or features that remind people of the myriad ways Facebook keeps track of their personal data and actions.\n\nThat's not to say that the two-day event, held at the San Jose Convention Center, won't be packed with important information for the thousands of developers who are the lifeblood of Facebook's external ecosystem. Indeed, this year's event is touted as \""biggest F8 to date,\"" with a schedule offering 84 sessions on everything from \""What's New with News Feed\"" to \""Updates to Facebook App Ads\"" to \""Messenger for Businesses,\"" and everything in between.\n\nAnd imagine how packed the house will be at the \""Security at Facebook Scale\"" talk by chief security officer (for now) Alex Stamos. \""You've heard that Facebook is investing heavily in security and safety in 2018,\"" the official session guide reads. \""Come learn how we approach security to protect our community and company.\"" After all, nobody has a bigger interest in whether or not Facebook can get it right on security and privacy than the thousands of developers who build third-party tools on its infrastructure.\n\nFacebook's community of third-party developers has a giant investment in the future of the company's many platforms-including Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Oculus. And those developers have little choice but to persevere regardless of whether or not Zuckerberg, COO Sheryl Sandberg, or vice president Andrew Bosworth are being pilloried in the media or Facebook's stock is plummeting and costing tens of billions of dollars of market cap loss. (At the moment, Wall Street is once again happy with the company after its stellar first-quarter earnings report earlier this week -- its stock price is now within striking distance of where it was pre-Cambridge Analytica.)"
Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""Facebook's much-rumored move into cryptocurrency is official. On Tuesday, the Facebook-led Libra Association introduced itself and its mission to the public. This alliance of financial and tech titans will function as an independent not-for-profit organization headquartered in Geneva, responsible for overseeing the development and governance of a new blockchain built for payments. The group aims to create a cryptocurrency that is stable, scalable, and compliant, and designed for a mass consumer market that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have not yet served -- including consumers in countries where even having a bank account at all is not the norm.\n\nLibra's 28 founding members include some of the world's biggest brands; humanitarian organizations focused on financial inclusion; an impressive brain trust that includes bitcoin pioneers Mickey Malka and Wences Casares, Coinbase's Emilie Choi, A-list venture capitalists Katie Haun, Fred Wilson, and Josh Kushner; and crypto startups funded by investors Naval Ravikant, Max Levchin, and Elad Gil; and even a nonprofit backed by Israeli-Russian billionaire Yuri Milner that is searching for extraterrestrial life.\n\nBy category, the 28 members include:\n\nMarketplaces: Facebook, eBay, Farfetch, Mercado Pago, Lyft, Uber, Spotify, Booking Holdings (Priceline, Kayak)\n\nPayments: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Naspers/PayU, Stripe\n\nTelecommunications: Vodafone, Iliad\n\nBlockchain: Coinbase, Xapo, Anchorage, Bison Trails\n\nVenture capital: Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, Thrive Capital, Ribbit Capital, Breakthrough Initiatives\n\nNonprofits: Kiva, Women's World Banking, Mercy Corps, Creative Destruction Lab\n\nNoticeably absent are tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Square. Also among the missing: Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange owned by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, best known for their battle with ENTITY over the ownership of Facebook.\n\nAt a press briefing at Facebook, Dante Dispartes, head of policy and communications for the Libra Association, told me that the organization is still looking for additional members. It aims to have 100 members contribute a minimum of $10 million apiece in Libra tokens by the time the cryptocurrency launches in early 2020. That billion-dollar goal will fund the operating costs of the association and an incentive program for acquisition of merchants and customers. As each member is responsible for running a node that validates transactions on the blockchain, the association has set a high bar to join. Among the criteria is whether a company has $1 billion in market value, a reach of over 20 million users globally, and/or recognition by a notable trade association or media outlet as a leader in its field.\n\nLibra expects to use the money it raises from its token sale not only to cover the operating costs of the association but also to fund merchant and wallet incentives, some of which could be in the form of discounts for people who use the currency as a form of payment. No details on such deals are yet available. (There have been rumors that Lyft and Uber might offer a price break to people who pay with Libra.)"
Guptas,1,"Members of South Africa's controversial Gupta family have long been implicated in a series of corrupt political connections and illegal deals that have earned them millions, often in government funds. The influence of the family, now reportedly in exile in Dubai, is so all-pervasive that the affair is widely known as the \state capture scandal.\""\n\nOCCRP has previously reported how Gupta-linked firms and operators extracted money from a state transport infrastructure company, profited from a corrupt locomotive tender, exploited a compliant bank, and emptied part of a pension fund for state workers using insider information.\n\nThe total amount of money allegedly stolen by the ENTITY and their associates reaches into the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWhat's been largely unreported is what happened to this money after it was safely out of the reach of the state.\n\nThe matter is much more than an intellectual exercise. After the country's high court recently ordered Trillian, an investment firm at the centre of the ENTITY' web, to repay R595m unlawfully taken from the state electricity company, it emerged that the money was no longer in the firm's accounts.\n\nNow, having exclusively obtained a Trillian server containing more than three million documents, including memos, invoices, and internal emails, OCCRP has been able to piece together where at least a portion of the ENTITY' millions went between 2014 and 2017.\n\nUnder Trillian's direction, the money was cycled through a network of 10 shell companies and consulting firms that held accounts at South African and international banks. The money, which also passed through a Bermudan group of companies, ended up as far afield as India and Dubai.\n\nIntra-company and shareholder loans appeared to be a key mechanism for the laundering of the money, which in some cases was repeatedly moved from firm to firm, obfuscating its origin.\n\nThe new findings account for how the ENTITY acquired a large portion of their fortune, mainly through inflated contracts with state-owned entities such as Eskom, the state electricity provider. South Africa's High Court has ruled that the deals were illegal. The R595m sought by the court, and paid to Trillian in tranches, are among the newly revealed transactions.\n\nExclusive new emails\n\nThough Trillian is difficult to link to the ENTITY directly - the family is known to work through trusted associates - exclusive, newly revealed emails appear to show one \""R P Gupta\"" communicating personally about the deals. The name may refer to Rajesh Gupta, the youngest of the brothers.\n\nIn addition to sending millions to offshore firms, Trillian appears to have spent or laundered even more through various other schemes, including paying exorbitant service fees to consultants. By working with KF Investments, a Johannesburg-based investment firm, Trillian even managed to buy and hold shares in major global businesses including Woolworths Holdings and British American Tobacco.\n\nREAD: As Eskom asks Interpol for help, leaks shed light on how Gupta-linked firm may have moved millions\n\nThe ENTITY' dealings were aided by other businesses. Stein Scop Attorneys, a Johannesburg-based law firm located near Trillian's high-priced offices, was the attorney of choice and record for most of the deals. The firm received over R100m from Trillian and held it in trust accounts.\n\nThe centre of the web\n\nTrillian, an unassuming investment firm once headquartered in Johannesburg's swanky Melrose Arch neighborhood, is the key instrument of the ENTITY' dealings. Spun out of Regiments, another key piece of the empire that featured heavily in earlier reporting about the ENTITY, the firm took over the company's trade in securities.\n\nTrillian oversaw the network of consultancies and shell firms that helped the ENTITY shift their gains. According to documents found on the company's server, it was both the sender and the recipient of the key transactions, which include millions from Eskom and other sources:\n\n* Trillian received $41m from Eskom, the state electricity firm, in illegal contracts. This theft has been widely reported and is now the subject of a judgment by the High Court. New documents reveal that over R300m of this money was paid into the accounts of nine firms overseen by Trillian and controlled by the ENTITY. Millions were then recycled back to Trillian to help disguise the money's origin. A further R205m was paid out to Trillian's Bank of Baroda account in South Africa and another company in the group, Trillian Shared Services. The remainder was directly paid out to Gupta lieutenants.\n\n* Trillian received just over half a billion rand ($30m) in loans from three firms controlled by Gupta associates: Centaur, Cutting Edge, and Albatime. In all three cases, the loans may not have been intended to be repaid, and may represent the laundering of funds initially sent to these firms by Trillian itself. Part of the money originated from a separate Eskom payment revealed in a previous OCCRP investigation. The remainder came from other public entities such as Transnet, a state-owned transportation company.\n\nIn addition to cycling money it had received from state entities, the records show that Trillian also moved tens of millions of dollars acquired by other companies in the ENTITY' network in a series of financial transactions that may have been intended to launder the money. The company's CFO, Tebogo Leballo, did not respond to questions. Rajesh 'Tony' Gupta and Atul Gupta could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe trader and the enforcer\n\nTrillian and the network of shell companies it oversaw was the brainchild of two key Gupta associates: Eric Wood, a stock trader and former director of Regiments Capital, and Salim Essa, the man who would link the family to key political players. The company was created in 2015, and the two men's relationship is widely thought to date from that year.\n\nREAD: Gordhan: Over R2.1bn recovered in overcoming the 'rot' of state capture\n\nHowever, documents newly obtained from the Trillian server show that Wood and Essa first linked up at least three years earlier. In a September 2012 email to Essa with the subject line \""project scoping,\"" Wood outlined how, working together, the two men could win business deals worth R775m over a period of two months - September to November 2012 - from state companies, including Denel and Transnet (Eskom, the ENTITY' biggest financial heist, was not yet listed). The message, which is clearly part of a larger discussion, reveals that Wood and Essa - who was acting on behalf of the ENTITY - were already discussing the public entities that they later exploited.\n\nIn 2013, Essa's company, Elgasolve, formally became Regiments' business development partner. The firms would be involved in a series of destructive deals with state entities which amassed large profits for Essa, Gupta associate Kuben Moodley - and the ENTITY - who appeared to receive half of the profits.\n\nThough comfortable with the existing relationship, Regiments' other directors declined Elgasolve's subsequent offer to purchase 50% of the company. But, unlike his Regiments colleagues, Wood was eager to deepen his ties to the family.\n\nBy spring of 2015, he and Essa co-founded Trillian with the aim of creating a vehicle that would enable them to keep all the state money for themselves. According to an affidavit seen by reporters, the plan was to run the company only until 2019 - a period intended to correspond to Jacob Zuma's term in office. The president and his political allies were key to making the ENTITY' state capture possible.\n\nThe early exit of Zuma from office ended Wood and Essa's deals sooner than expected - but not without hundreds of million of dollars under their belt.\n\nWood did not respond to phone calls or to questions sent by email. Essa could not be reached.\n\nCentaur's false loans\n\nIn his doctoral thesis submitted to South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand, Wood made a blunt case for an aggressive style of moneymaking. He argued that the key to success as a trader is to make high-risk investments - and not to count on having a long career. In other words: Haul in the money - and fast.\n\nIn his thesis, Wood listed a Bermuda-based company, Centaur Asset Management, as an example of a financial service provider.\n\nBut Centaur was not just any company. It was part of a group of companies conceived by the ENTITY which received tens of millions of dollars from Trillian - and then agreed to \""loan\"" R400m back to the trader on September 1, 2016. To build a legitimate-looking paper trail for the operation, Trillian entered into an agreement to provide financial advisory services to Centaur, which was ostensibly a mining company.\n\nIn fact, according to leaked documents from the Bank of Baroda, where the accounts involved in this transaction were held, this operation represented part of the millions the ENTITY had taken from Eskom, as well as other income from state companies, such as Transnet. The money was cycled through these loans, which made no business sense unless they were designed to disguise its origins.\n\nAfter arriving back in Trillian's hands, the money was then sent on to Cutting Edge Commerce, a South African company co-owned by the ENTITY.\n\nThough there is no document showing that the ENTITY owned Centaur themselves, a wealth of evidence points to the fact that it is their creation.\n\nAccording to Trillian documents obtained by OCCRP, the Centaur group consists of at least seven Bermuda-based entities and one South African company - most of them created in 2014. The ENTITY were copied in emails relating to the companies' activities.\n\nREAD: Popo Molefe: 'fight back' campaign by those unseated by state capture revelations\n\nBut they were run by proxies: An Indian citizen named Akash Garg, who married into the Gupta family, and a Dubai-based U.K. citizen named Daniel McGowan.\n\nGarg's move to South Africa with his family was actively assisted by the ENTITY. Visa requests relating to the move were found in emails sent and received by Ashu Chawla, an employee of Rajesh \""Tony\"" Gupta - a Gupta brother whom Garg referred to as \""mamaji,\"" an Indian term of respect. The visa requests were addressed to the South African government on the letterhead of Sahara, another Gupta company. (Garg and Chawla could not be reached for comment.)\n\nWhen he registered two of the Centaur companies, McGowan listed their addresses as an apartment in Dubai's famous Burj Khalifa tower. Emails on the Trillian server show that Tony Gupta sought to purchase an apartment in the same building, presumably for Duduzane Zuma, the son of the deposed president.\n\nMcGowan's email address at Centaur was cc'd on exchanges between Tony Gupta and Salim Essa involving the apartment. According to a realtor also included in the exchanges, the papers would be sorted by the time Duduzane arrived.\n\nMcGowan's communications with Essa and the ENTITY also show their efforts to make Centaur look like a legitimate investment firm.\n\nIn a 2014 email, for instance, McGowan writes that the company needed to hold roughly $8 million in its account to show that it had capital. This money, he wrote, \""could be paid to Centaur for a day [,] we could then issue the proof of funds directly and return the money the same day.\""\n\nInvoices found on the Trillian server reveal the mechanism the ENTITY used to siphon over half a billion rand from Eskom. This is the $41m now sought by the High Court.\n\nThe first step was for Eskom to send the money to Trillian. The first payment was made precisely one day after Eskom approved Trillian as a registered supplier, raising the question of how any work done could have been assessed within 24 hours. Trillian acknowledged in its own internal documents that the company lacked credentials and the necessary skills.\n\nAfter arriving in Trillian's accounts, large portions of the Eskom money quickly disappeared into a set of consultancies and shell companies. For example, after receiving over R235m from Eskom in August 2016, Trillian sent on a full R221m within five days.\n\nTwo of the companies that received this money were Gupta-linked consultancies Cutting Edge and eGateway. They received the money after invoicing Trillian for work they had allegedly done for Eskom. Explanatory notes such as \""data analysis,\"" \""cost saving initiatives,\"" and \""technical services\"" - with no further contracts or any additional details - point to the fact that the work was, in fact, fictitious. In total, Cutting Edge and eGateway - which was described by Trillian as housing \""some of the best skills in the world\"" - received almost R204m from the state utility.\""\n\nREAD: Eskom to study High Court orders on Trillian deals\n\nCutting Edge and eGateway were able to receive payment from Eskom for their \""work\"" because Trillian had joined an Eskom contract that global consulting giant McKinsey had already won.\n\nMcKinsey flagged its new South African partner as a risk due to Essa's presence and sought to distance itself by denying any relationship. However, it had little choice but to accept the situation - thanks in part to Eskom's head at the time, Anoj Singh, who travelled on the Gupta's bill to Dubai. (Meanwhile, according to Trillian's own internal investigation - the Budlender Report - the Minister of Public Enterprises Lynne Brown denied at the time that Trillian had been paid by Eskom).\n\neGateway's relationship with Trillian also reveals, for the first time, direct involvement by one of the Gupta brothers in the network's questionable financial operations. The company's email address, egateway@gmail.com, was overseen by someone who signed his emails as \""R P Gupta.\"" The youngest Gupta brother is named Rajesh Gupta (though he often goes by Tony).\n\nEmails show that correspondents considered this account to be important. In one email from July 2016, R P Gupta sends a short note of praise to a Trillian employee, thanking him for work, which he describes as \""highly appreciated by Escom [sic] and Trillian.\""\n\nIn response, Trillian's employee is obsequious, referring to R P Gupta as \""Respected Sir\"" and emphasising that he will do what is needed.\n\nThe ENTITY' two consultancies, Cutting Edge and eGateway, received over a third of Eskom's $41m.\n\nAccording to bank transfers found in the Trillian data, as well as invoices justifying some of these transfers, another large portion - over R100m, or about $7.5m - was sent to six shell companies based in South Africa. One of them, Pactrade, is not known to have issued any invoices.\n\nThough these firms appeared to be independent of Trillian, they showed few signs of functioning businesses.\n\nThree of them - Medjoul, Fortime, and Birsaa - listed the same registration address, shared the same director, and collectively deregistered in the same month: August 2017. In addition to receiving money from Eskom, they appear to have been used to receive other illicit payments from state companies: The Trillian data include invoices they filed to Transnet, Denel, SA Express and others.\n\nFour other shells - Jacsha, Shacob, Matson and Pactrade - also shared common directors, and some shared the same addresses. Multiple invoices citing Eskom were filed by these companies in August 2016 (though Pactrade's were not among the data). These were part of a vague \""Commission Agreement\"" with Trillian allowing them to bill up to 50 percent for introductions to new clients and business opportunities.\n\nThe shell companies' South African bank accounts were held at Standard Bank, ABSA and First National Bank, among others.\n\nIt is difficult to know just much the shell companies received due to the volume of Eskom cash shuffled between different entities. Documents on the Trillian server show that, between August 13 and 15, 2016, the company made payments of several million dollars in Eskom money to its shell companies. It also paid R205m to Trillian Capital Partners' account at the Bank of Baroda and Trillian Shared Services' account at First National Bank.\n\nThese accounts transferred still more back to the Gupta-linked shell companies. For example, on August 18, 2016, Trillian Shared Services transferred close to R15m of their Eskom take to Fortime, Medjoul, and Birsaa and R45m to another Essa-linked company, Zestilor. On the previous day, August 17, Trillian had agreed to pay Zestilor R200m ($14.8m) for their services, according to a document signed by Trillian's CFO, Tebogo Leballo.\n\nMoreover, as soon as Eskom sent the funds to Trillian's account at the Bank of Baroda, Trillian asked the bank to send R75m back. These funds may also have been intended for Zestilor. On August 18, Leballo instructed Trillian to make a payment of R75m ($5.6m) to Zestilor, adding that he \""would provide details later.\"" On August 31, Ashok Narayan sent more than a dozen invoices to Leballo, which showed that funds paid to shell companies including Fortime and Birsaa were payments \""to cover the R75m to Zestilor,\"" or $5.6m.\n\nThe following year, Trillian carried out an internal review of Zestilor that showed that Sahara, a Gupta-owned company, was Zestilor's only client. Emails from 2015 obtained by OCCRP show that Zestilor's First National Bank account was aided by employees of Gupta-owned Sahara. For example, Santoush Choubey, a Sahara employee, sent an email to Salim Essa, with a copy to Tony Gupta, that showed he had knowledge of Zestilor's financial and ownership structures. The email addressed Essa as \""dear sir.\""\n\nThese transactions are an important find because that Bank of Baroda account is known to be controlled by the ENTITY and was also used by the family's other shell companies.\n\nIn late 2015, as South African banks started to shut down Gupta accounts, Trillian began to open more accounts at foreign banks. In the minutes of a November 2016 meeting obtained by OCCRP, Wood said Trillian needed to \""mitigate the risk of our other accounts being unfairly frozen\"" by maintaining accounts in South African rand at the Dubai branch of Pakistan's Habib Bank and India's state-owned Bank of Baroda. Yet by 2017, South African banks like ABSA and FNB continued to bank Trillian. Wood's reference to the account closures appeared to reference the Gupta experience and not Trillian's.\n\nOther large payments from Trillian's ABSA account - and using the same Eskom money - were made to the Gupta-linked Albatime, as well as to Essa and Wood (through his company Numibrite). The Gupta lieutenants appeared to profit handsomely from the arrangement.\n\nYou've got mail\n\nAdditional email correspondence from the Trillian server demonstrates another link to the ENTITY.\n\nThe shell companies that handled the money appeared to be overseen by a single email address: wallemsa@gmail.com. In one instance, the owner of this account asked for payments with the all-caps demand \""PLEASE CONFIRM ONCE PAYMENT IS DONE\"" - without attaching an invoice.\n\nAccording to the records, the handler of this account, who was often simply referred to as \""A,\"" was Ashok Narayan, at the time an employee of the ENTITY' first company in South Africa, Sahara Systems (Narayan could not be reached for comment.)\n\nEven before Trillian was created, some Regiments employees appeared already to know that Narayan handled shell companies for the ENTITY that took an even split of profits from government contracts. A late 2015 email from a Regiments employee to Narayan read, \""Hi Ashok, See attached the schedule for the allocation of the payment that was done on Friday to both Fortime and Birsaa.\"" The attachment described a 50-50 split for money that had been received from state companies.\n\nThrough their employee, Narayan, the ENTITY kept a close watch over Regiments, the emails show.\n\nIn July 2015, for instance, Wood forwarded him notice of a R14.2m payment from Transnet to Regiments. In another email, Wood shared with Narayan his correspondence with Anoj Singh, the former head of Eskom, in which he advocated for Regiments to receive \""market related compensation\"" for work done. Narayan, in turn, reported information to Essa, whom he referred to with respect as \""bhai.\""\n\nNarayan is better known for his role in Homix, a company previously reported to have received oceans of cash from Regiments - but never before definitively linked to Essa. A May 2014 draft company agreement found on the Trillian server shows Homix being appointed as a \""strategic technical service provider\"" to Regiments with the goal of producing \""business opportunity.\"" The document's properties show that Essa modified it as soon as it was created, showing that he was involved. By 2015, one honest employee worried by media reports asked Wood, in an email titled \""Homix and Anoj Singh,\"" \""we have paid [Homix] 200m+ in the last financial year... Can you tell me the nature of our relationship with Homix?\""\n\nWood did not respond. Singh could not be reached for comment.\n\nStein scop are excellent\n\nWhen a Trillian employee did not know who was behind the seven consultancy firms reaping hundreds of millions in Eskom money, he asked Stein Scop Attorneys - a law firm located a stone's throw from Trillian's offices in Melrose Arch. The firm reported that outside of directors like Ayub Vali Ali, an Indian national, the beneficial owners of the shell firms were unknown.\n\nStein Scop managed to become one of the biggest beneficiaries of Trillian's government work by charging the Gupta network hefty legal fees to the tune of millions of dollars. The firm spent months prosecuting Trillian whistleblower Mosilo Mothepu, staving off investigations into Trillian, and otherwise defending the firm.\n\nStein Scop's bank account held significant amounts of Trillian's money in trust for both specified and - largely - unspecified purposes. At least a portion of this amount could represent part of the stolen Eskom millions, since the transactions were made at about the same time.\n\nBut whether it was setting up agreements with companies like Centaur or overseeing a range of opaque projects nicknamed Fusion, E2E, Mumbai, and others, Stein Scop was always available for Trillian.\n\nStein Scop did not appear to have many clients outside of Trillian and Regiments, if a letter from their auditor is to be believed. The letter confirms that, for the year ending at the end of February 2016, Stein Scop did not generate more than R10m in annual revenue.\n\nWhen a Trillian employee sought a law firm to create and backdate a contract with Cutting Edge which had been receiving Eskom money, Trillian's chief financial officer responded, \""Please use Stein Scop, they have been excellent.\""\n\nStein Scop did not respond to specific questions about their work with Trillian, citing client confidentiality. They confirmed that they were one of several law firms to act on behalf of Trillian, but said they withdrew representation from the firm in 2017."

And it comes from one of the most high-profile groups in the space.\n\nHe says Europe is not quite there yet, but is one its way.\n\n\Europe has the potential to emerge as a global leader in blockchain technology...This is in part down to an openness towards innovative technologies, coupled with regulatory developments,\"" he told Sifted.\n\n\""Europe is [Coinbase's] biggest market outside of the U.S...We are currently operational in all 28 EEA countries and are always looking at options for expanding our presence whether that is through partnerships or acquisitions.\""\n\nTo illustrate this, below is an overview of Europe's late-stage ecosystem, including those who have raised - or have revenue - of ~£15m+.\n\nTo explain these categories further, please see below:\n\n\""Trading and Transfer\"" - This encompasses platforms where you can trade, store, or spend in crypto (or crypto derivatives). The leader, Bitstamp, is based in the UK while Bitpanda was born in Germany. Meanwhile, Finland's LocalBitcoins offers peer-to-peer bitcoin swaps around the world, and oversaw $187m in traded volume in August alone according to CryptoCompare. Note, while there is a widespread problem with crypto exchanges faking volumes, those listed are generally accepted to more established platforms.\n\n\""Custody\"" - Think of these as digital safes for crypto, with specialised tech that protects the assets against hacks, loss or theft.\n\n\""Wallet\"" - Similar to the above but online, rather than in the form of a physical USB-like key. That means it's easier to access in order to trade, but arguably less hack-proof that custodied assets.\n\n\""Crypto mining\"" - These lucrative companies run large, specialised computers which process the transactions on a given blockchain. Every time they \""mine\"" digital currencies like Bitcoin, they receive a fee. Most are based in countries with cool climates like Iceland, where Genesis has a base.\n\n\""Software\"" - This covers an eclectic group of companies building blockchain's \""revolutionary\"" promises, including reforming financial services. R3 has raised over $120m for the privilege while Nivaura is backed by the London Stock Exchange, but both have been riled by accusations of delays and over-promises.\n\nBeyond that, it's worth remembering that this list only just scratches the surface. Underpinning these companies are other smaller tech companies and specialised hedge funds and banks.\n\nStill, for all its progress, Europe has a particular obstacle: fresh funds.\n\n\""The only thing missing is access to capital. There are only a handful of European early-stage funds investing in crypto or blockchain,\"" says Brunet, who also runs the largest European crypto newsletter.\n\nIt's true. The pool of local, specialised VCs is essentialy limited to Fabric, Blueyard, Blockchain Ventures, Outlier and Libertus. In addition, the size of these funds pail in comparison to the US's biggest players, which includes Andreessen Horowitz's $300 million crypto arm and Pantera, which raised a $160m fund earlier this year.\n\nAnother issue is that countless European companies (and tokens) like Melonport don't survive; admittedly, a normal issue among startups. Part of the problem is the slow adoption of crypto, which has struggled to communicate its use-cases; fuelling 'fatigue' and disillusion in some spheres.\n\nStill, an unintended consequence of this 'fatigue' is the rise of \""anti-blockchain\"" European startups; firms which are based on the premise that blockchain's capabilities are overestimated.\n\nThey instead rely on alternative specialised technology, including London-based firm Thought Machine and Radix DLT, who reportedly turned down over $100m in investment capital and is backed by the co-founder of Transferwise."
Richard Branson,0,"EXTORTIONIST CATCHES'EXTORTIONIST' - BIRK OF BIRKBECK HELD IN NONG PLALAI PRISON - THAILAND\n\nBUT WHAT IS THE TRUTH BEHIND THE ARREST IN THAILAND OF FORMER SCHOOLMATE Of ENTITY, UNIVERSITY CHALLENGE WINNER, AND ARMY OFFICER, THOR HALLAND?\n\nIt made the Bangkok Post and the story did not quite sound right. It made the PattayaOne news site and the author who wrote it said he did not understand it either.\n\nWhy on earth is Thor Halland, a former stalwart of the Pattaya City Expats Club, now languishing in a Pattaya jail after trying to get 50,000 baht in goods seized and 15,000 by bank transfer out of a French halal food producer called Laurent Thierry , or Thierry Laurent.\n\nThis is hardly a Thai national newspaper story.\n\nWell it might be if they included that fact that Halland , was one of the Birks of Birkbeck, (Birkbeck College, University of London) which won the British television series 'University Challenge' in 2003 hosted by Jeremy Paxman, and who held a short-term commission in the British Army, and who had attended to Stow public school with ENTITY. (His partner in the alleged crime Denis Zabadoev is a boxer and performs locally.)\n\nBut the newspapers did not know that.\n\nI do not know Thor Halland but I know of him and have exchanged emails. But first here below is the story published by PattayaOne newspaper.\n\nPATTAYA: -- Chonburi Immigration Police announced on Thursday the arrest of a Russian and British National wanted in connection with a case of theft and extortion from March 2015.\n\nPolice Colonel Prapansak, the Superintendent of Chonburi Immigration, based in Jomtien, announced the arrest of Mr. Denis Zabodaev aged 31 from Russia and Mr. Thor Hallan (sic) aged 45, a long-time expat residing in Pattaya.\n\nBoth were arrested based on arrest warrant numbers 250/2558 and 251/2558 dated 19th May 2015 and issued by the Pattaya Provincial Court. They are accused of theft and extortion from Mr. Laurent Thery (Thierry) aged 51 from France who runs an import/export Halal Food Factory at the Egmongkol Village 4 Estate in Soi Kaotalo in East Pattaya.\n\nOn 26th March a group of 4 men are alleged to have entered his factory and removed assets totaling 50,000 Baht in value. Mr. Thery was then escorted to his apartment at the Royal Thai Residence in Soi 7 off the Thepprasit Road in Jomtien where a further 50,000 Baht's worth of assets were taken, including computers and phones. CCTV from the apartment complex was obtained by Police who will submit this to court as part of their evidence against the two arrested men.\\n\nAnd here is the Bangkok Post report. Both newspapers demonstrate the willingness of newspapers in Thailand to publish whatever the police say without question even getting the names wrong.\n\nWhy was this matter handled by immigration police? And why on a charge involving 10,000 baht of goods seized plus 15,000 baht by bank transfer (total about £2,200) was Halland denied bail?\n\nBesides Pattaya police do not as a rule investigate foreign crimes against foreigners.\n\nThat seems a bit unfair because the guy who reported to him was none other than Drew Walter Noyes, of One-Stop-Service-Center and he has been glowing all week about the news. Noyes' is to whom the Frenchman took his case.\n\nDrew Noyes, 59, is of course the businessman who last year convicted of extortion and jailed for 2 years. He is out on appeal on bail. He has only spent one night in detention - and the sums involved are much higher.\n\nHe was accused of attempting to extort the out of Thonglor Clinic initially out of 7 millon baht (£135,000+) later reduced to 2.3 million (£43,000). That was when he was publisher of the 'Pattaya Times' newspaper.\n\nWell the matter was handled by Immigration Police because Thor Halland, and presumably his alleged co-conspirator, did not turn up in court to face charges brought by the Frenchman. Hence a warrant was issued for his arrest.\n\n(It is possible that he did not know about the court cases I guess because Drew Noyes has managed to get the Pattaya Court to court issue writs which the accused do not ever receive and which can even be sent to hotels where the co-accused may have stayed once (Drew Noyes V Andrew Drummond and Alastair Cooper) or writs by public notice (which no foreigners would have a clue about finding). But that is conjecture)\n\nMuch more to the point is who is Thor Halland and what is his relationship with Drew Walter Noyes, the American who announced he had come to Thailand by Royal Proclamation and then set up beer bars in Pattaya?\n\nThor Halland, is a onetime property man, one time army officer, who settled in Pattaya many years ago. He was a big voice at the Pattaya City Expat Club which Drew Noyes claims he started - and he even wrote the Wikipedia entry for Pattaya and gave talks on the history of Thailand and even gave a talk to the Pattaya International Women's Club Club on Buddhism.\n\nHalland is regarded as a bit of a toff even taking part in a local theatre group and of course pub quizzes.\n\nHighly read in 2003 he had been on the winning University Challenge team from Birkbeck College, who were referred to as the 'Birks' because in a previous context they had achieved the lowest possible score.\n\nHalland studied Philosophy at Birkbeck College.\n\nHe was in fact part of the Drew Noyes faction at the Pattaya City Expats Club along with Andre Machielsen and they furiously defended Noyes who was beginning to come under attack from some members.\n\nThey also joined Noyes on an army day out and got the same Royal medals Noyes claims all over social media where Noyes taking to adding to his CV saying he was now trained as a skydiver and marksman.\n\nThey paid for them - 10,000 baht each - and one American participant said he had to pay Noyes 20,000 baht for the army camp day out.\n\nHalland also became a contributing food writer to Drew Noyes' now defunct Pattaya Times.\n\nThat was until members of the expats club discovered the truth.\n\nDrew Noyes was conning members by selling them condos in the Keha Condo scheme (above his office) which he had acquired from the Thai National Housing Authority who were granting subsidised loans.\n\nOf course these units were meant for poorer Thai people. But what the hell. There was money to be made - lots of it. And Noyes inflated the prices and sold them on at twice the price he paid.\n\nThis all turned very ugly and Drew was forced to hand cash back on threat of prosecution and when it came to voting for the club's first President Noyes was out on his ear.\n\nBut the Expat Club members were still not happy with Noyes and Blogger spots started appearing on the net describing Noyes, amongst other things of being a sociopath. What he certainly was not was the 'American lawyer' he claimed to be.\n\nBoth Andre Machielsen and Halland, whom Noyes suspected were behind it all then became the targets of Noyes incandescent rage and desire for revenge. He started blog sites accusing Halland of being a mental case and of Machielsen of being a drugs dealer and wanted by the police (Just as he did with yours truly).\n\nHe ingratiated himself with the judges at Pattaya Court by holding a 'legal seminar' promoted by ThaiVisa.com and dining with judges and having himself photographed with them on Thai Law Day - or Wan Rapee. (He even announced that together with the Chief Judge of Chonburi he was writing a book which would feature the libels of Andrew Drummond after I had started writing about his scams)\n\nThe judges of course were unaware that Noyes had already been exposed in the United States before coming to Thailand in particular by the Wilmington Star in North Carolina where he had turned up offering his realtor services.\n\nThe Star described him as a man of 'myriad lies' and highlighted his property frauds, share scams and even a case of sexual harassment where he is alleged to have demanded oral sex from a junior employee in return for him granting her more hours work. All this in a front and inside page article by Scott Gold, now with the Los Angeles Times, headed 'Trouble Follows Developer'.\n\nNor did they know he had been arrested for larceny and had been jailed and put on 36 months' probation or his court listings for assaults on women\n\nHe threatened to sue Halland and Halland paid 10 baht damages to Noyes on the understanding he would implicate Machielsen as the man who was writing about him. It was getting all very grubby as things generally do where Noyes is involved.\n\nNoyes has been seeking revenge ever since especially since he discovered that Halland was openly speaking out against him in letters to this site.\n\nBut that of course does not explain why Halland should be kicking around with boxer Denis Zabdeav.\n\nCOMMENT: Don't confuse this with an action by the Russian mafia in Pattaya though. But as we have already highlighted, Noyes, and his henchmen David Hanks and Brian Goodie DO have connections to the Russian mafia.\n\nHanks was arrested with a Russian godfather for racketeering and of course Noyes provided visa services to Russian and East European prostitutes to they could ply their trade in Pattaya- at least according to several young women who contacted this site. And that brings us around to Pattaya Immigration Police again."

Read on below to find out what Kutcher's net worth is and how he made much of his money.\n\nAshton Kutcher grew up in Iowa and went to college at the University of Iowa. While in college, he won a modeling contest and subsequently moved to New York to sign with modeling agency Next.\n\nKutcher had a relatively good modeling career in the late 1990s. He got to walk in several fashion weeks and even appeared in Calvin Klein commercials.\n\nHowever, Kutcher did not do modeling work for a long time. After a while, he decided to move to Los Angeles to pursue acting.\n\nIn 1998, Kutcher landed a role on That's 70's Show as Michael Kelso, a good-looking but immature young guy. The show became a huge hit and Kutcher also became a household name. He remained on That's 70's Show for its whole eight-season run, which ended in 2006.\n\nIn 2010, Kutcher co-founded A-Grade Investment to invest in technology start-ups. The firm started out by investing $30 million into companies such as Skype, FourSquare, Path, Uber, and Airbnb. In just six years, they turned the $30 million into $250 million.\n\nKutcher also co-founded another investment firm in 2015 called Sound Ventures. The firm is a successor to A-Grade Investment, and according to medium, Sound Ventures specializes \""in early stage to growth and late-stage venture investments.\""\n\nKutcher's investment work was recognized by other venture capitalists when he became a guest shark on Shark Tank in 2015.\n\nAshton currently has a net worth of $200 million, as reported by Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nIt has been said that Kutcher made around $200,000 and $280,000 per episode.

Richard Branson,0,"I recently read the book Dangerous Hero: Corbyn's Ruthless Plot For Power, by renowned investigative journalist Tom Bower. Bower has also written books on various people such as ENTITY, Rupert Murdoch, Robert Maxwell and Tony Blair, with varying degrees of deserved brutality. He now has turned his attention on the leader of Her Majesty's opposition.\n\nMuch of the book is not quite the trove of astonishing revelations that it might have appeared to be, if only because I had realised quite some time ago what Corbyn is and stands for, and read about his involvement in, and support for, hard-Left causes for quite some time. I knew about his support for Hamas, his attendance at a funeral of a killer of Israeli athletes (he initially lied about it), his outreach to Sinn Fein IRA within days of the Brighton bombing of 1984 (I was a student living in Brighton at the time, and it was when the name \Corbyn\"" first entered my consciousness), his holiday-making in the Soviet satellite states and so on. I knew much of this, and assume that most political junkies who follow UK affairs had a reasonably solid grasp of all this gruesome detail.\n\nWhat is nonetheless striking about this book is the way it shows that Corbyn's Marxism was quite possibly formed in a period when - never fully explained in his own accounts - he left Jamaica (in the late 60s) and had, so Bower speculates, gone to Cuba. Corbyn's hatred of the UK, and the empire it created, is very much at the core of his political credo. Corbyn is incurious in some ways about enterprise - other than loathing it, and has tended to leave the details of how a socialist state will direct our lives to colleagues such as John McDonnell. What really floats Corbyn's boat is his adversialism towards the UK and West as a whole. Any power and person whom he thinks has the ability to hurt the UK and the West as a whole gets his support, no matter how murderous or malevolent.\n\nThis anti-British, anti-Western stance is a coherent strand throughout. It explains Corbyn's cozying up to Iran (and willingness to appear on Iranian TV and get paid for this) - because he hates Israel (a pro-Western, broadly free nation); it explains, even his anti-semitism (Bowen is very clear about this; no sophistry about how Corbyn is anti-Zionist but not anti-semitic); it is the key to his hatred of the US and of course the UK. It shows why he has been a champion of the cause of a united Ireland, preferring to support the IRA, and attend the funerals of IRA operatives, rather than focus on the messier routes of democratic politics in Northern Ireland. And it also shows why he has more recently praised Venezuela, at least until its recent disasters, because that country was seen as being a pain in the bum for the US. To take another Latin American case, Corbyn was happy, it seems, for the Argentinian junta to invade the Falklands Islands, a UK territory, and never mind the democratic wishes of the island's locals.\n\nOne of the most useful parts of the book was its account, told with moments of unintended humour, of Corbyn's time as a Labour Party councillor in North London, and of how he worked to remove real/alleged enemies and take control. Bower also shows that while Corbyn obviously craved the approval and circle of senior hard-Left figures such as Tony Benn, he was no real intellectual himself and did not contribute original ideas. What Corbyn was very effective at - and Bower ruefully admits this - was being an organiser of protest. He also had a sort of rubber-ball quality - he seemed able to take all kinds of abuse and setbacks and keep ploughing on. He was and is also fairly immune to straightforward venality and corruption, one of his few positive traits. (That does not mean his views are less unpleasant, but as far as one can tell Corbyn was not motivated by money in the way that Tony Blair seems to have been.) It also seems that he is quite a red-blooded sort of bloke, but also not very easy to get on with for the long haul: three marriages as of the time of writing. Another nugget: One of his former wives said that she never saw him read a book during the time they were together.\n\nIt is sobering to think that Corbyn has learned nothing from the past half a century in any way that would affect his thinking away from socialism. The many disasters of socialist states have had no impact on his thinking. At all. The end of the Berlin Wall is, one suspects, a grave sadness to him, and people around him, such as media advisor and unashamed Stalinist, Seamus Milne. This fixity of ideological purpose makes me think that socialism really is, for some, a secular religion. The Bower book contains the nugget that John McDonnell, now shadow Chancellor, once thought of going into the priesthood.\n\nNow, a socialist might scoff and say that libertarians can become a bit dogmatic too (that is correct), but there's a big difference: a market-based economy has, through the processes of bankruptcy and profit, a feedback system in which bad, mistaken ideas fail, and good ones succeed. With socialism, by contrast, failure (such as the misallocation of resources in Soviet Russia) is taken to mean that the State must do even more socialism, that \""beatings will continue until morale improves\"", so to speak. The free market is like a sort of constant Karl Popper-style testing of hypotheses (business ideas). Socialism does not have any sort of equivalent process.\n\nWhat to explain how far Corbyn has come despite all this? Bower gives some idea about this. Corbyn is sly and enjoys letting others do the dirty work of knifing colleagues and betraying real/alleged enemies, and likes to appear above it all, and play the part of the scruffy, dotty-but-endearing Leftie with his vegetable patch and penchant for photographing street furniture. It is striking how even the joke tag \""Magic Marxist Grandpa\"" is almost an affectionate term, until you realise what Marxism will do. Corbyn shows you can get away with appalling, mistaken views if you speak softly, are bit of a \""character\"" and have good manners (although he can lose his temper when confronted in some cases). And finally, there is Corbyn's quality of patience. He's been working away, waiting for his chance. In 2015, when the former Labour leader, Ed Milliband stood down, the party's leadership/voting rules allowed a person such as Corbyn to stand. People voted to let his name go on the ballot. It is proof that random events can really make a difference. (Ironically, it rather undermines the Marxist idea that we are propelled deterministically by economic forces and relations of production.)\n\nThe book, however, for all its pace and verve, is unlikely to convert a lot of people away from Corbyn and what he stands for, although I suppose one or two people might be swayed. I do think that the anti-semitism must have rattled a few even more devoted fans, and his dithering over the EU issue is a delight to watch because Brexit is an issue that doesn't fall into any obvious map that Corbyn has in his head.\n\nAn issue with this book is that Bower has no references or footnotes, a fact that Bower justifies by saying that so much of what he was told was off the record, and that he took legal advice to that effect. The problem with no references is that it is easy therefore for some people to attack the veracity of some of his details. Peter Oborne, who like some right-wingers has a sort of madly odd affection for Corbyn, on the grounds that he is \""authenic\"" (I fail to see what is great about being an authentic nasty piece of work), has attacked the book's accuracy. Bower hasn't responded. I remember many years ago, when I wrote pamphlets for libertarian causes, that Brian Micklethwait and other old friends such as the late Chris Tame drummed into me the importance of references and sources, with lots of specific details, in the interests of good scholarship. If a book is going to drive a stake into the heart of Corbyn, I think it would have been more effective had it contained some explicit sources.\n\nDangerous Hero is a gripping read - I went through it very fast - and it is gruesome, even chilling, reading. It is a well-paced, angrily written account of the life of a man who, let's not forget, is still a potential prime minister of this country. As his IRA chums used to say, defenders of freedom have to be eternally vigilant, because for the likes of Corbyn, they need to be lucky just once."

Richard Branson,0,"""The small, standardized satellites known as \""Cubesats\"" have increased access to space -- many launches include caches of Cubesats along with the main payload. Those tiny satellites are all hanging out around Earth, but that could change soon. Virgin Orbit, the rocket-based spinoff of Virgin Galactic, has signed a deal with Polish satellite company SatRevolution to send the first commercial Cubesats to Mars in 2022.\n\nENTITY's Virgin Galactic aims to send people into space for a few minutes at a time using an unusual rocket-powered spaceplane. The company has been testing its designs for years, and it hasn't always gone as planned. Virgin Orbit takes a similarly unusual approach to reach space. The company's LauncherOne rocket won't ignite its engines on the ground. Instead, it will attach to a conventional Boeing 747 airplane that carries it to a high altitude. Releasing the rocket up there reduces fuel consumption and makes it cheaper to reach space.\n\nNASA's InSight lander is currently alone on Mars, but it made the trip to the red planet with company. A pair of Cubesats called Mars Cube One (MarCO A and MarCO B) traveled along with it as a proof of concept that Cubesats could operate on interplanetary missions. NASA lost contact with these satellites (as expected) several weeks after InSight landed, but the success of Mars Cube One has convinced SatRevolution and Virgin Orbit that such spacecraft can contribute to our understanding of other planets.\n\nSatRevolution, which is working with a consortium of Polish universities and companies, hasn't provided precise details on what it hopes to accomplish. Well, other than being able to pat itself on the back about being the first to send commercial Cubesats to Mars. It says that Cubesats could capture photos, measure radiation levels, and more. Presumably, the Cubesats will perform flybys of Mars like Mars Cube One. To enter orbit, they would need powerful engines to reduce speed.\n\nBefore the Cubesats can head for Mars, Virgin Orbit needs to finish work on the LauncherOne system. The 70-foot rocket has been loaded aboard Virgin Orbit's 747 carrier for \""captive carry\"" and drop tests, but it hasn't ignited its engines in the air yet. Virgin Orbit hopes to conduct its first orbital test by the end of 2019."
Richard Branson,0,"""What's a light-year? The same as a regular year, but with fewer calories. Just an example there of the mind-numbing ramblings with which we have had to amuse ourselves, seemingly for decades, while twiddling our thumbs waiting for the world's first spaceport to open for business. How and why is commercial space travel taking so long?\n\nLet's backtrack a little, shall we? The recent interstellar coverage of Emirati astronaut Hazzaa AlMansoori's epic journey revived a burning childhood curiosity: Are we, humble tourists, ever going to space en masse? Since Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon half-a-century ago, speculation has been rife about 'when' not 'if' we will be embarking on our own galaxy quests. TV shows over the years such as the various Star Trek series and Stargate SG-1, not to mention the criminally overlooked Space Precinct, only fuelled imaginations, yet the closest we came to extra-terrestrial excursions was an opportunity to hitch a ride on a Russian rocket for an exorbitant fee at the turn of the millennium (a chance American engineer Dennis Tito embraced in 2001 for the princely sum of $20 million). Then in 2004, much like the evolutionary sequence in 2001: A Space Odyssey, we made 'a giant leap'. Sir Richard Branson, he of Virgin Cola fame (among other endeavours), announced his latest venture -- to build and run a fleet of spaceships carrying guests into orbit for a fraction of the cost.\n\n\""Huzzah,\"" exclaimed astro-enthusiasts who are fond of an anachronistic phrase or two. Nevertheless, here we are, 15 years later and the flourishing industry envisaged way back when 'I Phone' was merely a verb and Janet Jackson's Super Bowl halftime show incident was what constituted a scandal still appears many parsecs in the distance.\n\nIs it though? What's going on? In a nutshell (or should that be tin capsule?) -- blasting a busload of sightseers out of the troposphere is difficult. It involves testing and certifications that don't even exist. They're making it up as they go along. Plus, the accounts, barring a few early ticket sales, only show money going out on research and development. Continual investment with no immediate return can be arduous to acquire. However, here comes the good news. This week, according to CNBC, aircraft manufacturer Boeing has bought a $20 million stake in Virgin Galactic. Further encouragement came from the report with the fact Branson's lot have flown people to space twice aboard their SpaceShipTwo suborbital space plane, VSS Unity, in December 2018 and February this year; plus the company is in \""the final stretch\"" of testing, says Virgin Galactic CEO George Thomas Whitesides and he \""still feels good about going into operation next year.\"" We've heard similar promising noises before, but such high profile bankrolling does raise the spirits for a 2020 lift-off. What do you think? Are we on a course to go 'where no one has gone before'? Will you be first aboard?

The state prisons department is making it the first in the country to comply with the guidelines of a European antitorture watchdog -- considered a benchmark in the humane treatment of prisoners -- to ensure that extraditions are processed quickly.\n\nA separate barrack will be earmarked for , which can lodge at least 25 inmates.\n\nFugitive economic offenders like ENTITY and have fought India's extradition appeal with the claims that prison conditions in the country are appalling and deplorable, and operate in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman treatment.\n\nThe prisons department sent a letter to the state government in the first week of September, stating that to approve extradition requests, foreign courts and governments often insist on an undertaking from the Indian government that the offender will be lodged in a prison that meets the standards prescribed by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT). In some cases, an independent agency is sent to cross-verify assurances made by the Centre when seeking extradition.\n\nThe CPT is a specialised monitoring body of the 47-member Council of Europe, comprising independent and impartial experts such as lawyers, medical doctors and specialists in prison or police matters. It is not part of the European Union, but the latter often refers to the CPT's observations and recommendations when drafting legal texts as well as during communication with member and non-member states.\n\nThe letter referred particularly to India's protracted extradition appeal for Mallya and Modi, who are currently in the UK, \""despite overwhelming evidence against them\"". \""Mehul Choksi, residing in Antigua and Barbuda, is another accused whose extradition is being sought by the Central Bureau of Investigation,\"" it stated.\n\nAs the first step towards compliance with the CTP's standards, a team from the prisons department may soon visit the UK to learn about prison conditions there. The state government has been requested to clear this visit at the earliest.\n\nIn Maharashtra, only barrack 12 in the crowded currently has the facilities to lodge VIP inmates, but it can't take in any more offenders. \""It has tighter security -- an officer and a guard are on duty round the clock -- and its two cells are monitored 24x7 from a control room.

The 2,124-capacity Taloja jail is not as crowded -- as of July, it had 2,227 inmates.\n\nIn September last year, London's Westminster court, which is reviewing Mallya's petition against his extradition, had asked for a \""step by step video\"" showing conditions at Arthur Road jail's barrack 12. After India submitted the video, the court expressed satisfaction with the evidence and said that there were no grounds to believe that he faces any risk at all in the jail."
Vijay Mallya,1,"The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police has issued a preventive alert at all airports across the country against the accused in the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank. The preventive alert has been sent across immigration and security counters of the airports so that the accused involved do not flee the country.\n\nIn the past, several accused in bank frauds have managed to flee the country while very little success has been attained on bringing them back to face the law. Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and ENTITY are some of the fugitives who borrowed huge loans and duped banks using some modus operandi or the other.\n\nOn Monday, as per the complaint of the RBI administrator, EOW registered a case against PMC Bank's Managing Director Joy Thomas, Chairman Wareyam Singh and HDIL Chairman Wadhawan. Several others on the PMC management were also named in the case.\n\nThe complaint was registered by the RBI administrator Jasbir Singh Mattha, who in his complaint against the accused alleged that in the period starting 2008 till August 2019, the loans issued to a particular company by the PMC bank were not paid and had turned into NPA (non-performing asset). But, the information was not disclosed to the RBI by the PMC Bank as per banking norms.\n\nAlso, the PMC Bank officials prepared fake loan accounts and records with lesser amounts and submitted it to the RBI, which led to a loss of Rs 4355.46 crores, the complaint said.\n\nThe primary beneficiary to the losses suffered by the bank was HDIL group of companies and bank officials, in connivance with HDIL officials, were involved in the loans being offered and disbursement despite non-payments on various occasions.\n\nThe loan amount borrowed from the PMC Bank was misused by the debtors for their personal purposes, leading to major losses to the bank.\n\nPMC Bank MD Joy Thomas, in a letter addressed to the chief manager of PMC Bank, confessed to having hidden the fact regarding NPAs by HDIL on loans borrowed from the bank and also regarding forging records and accounts in front of the board and the RBI. Thomas goes on to say in the letter dated September 21, that the cover-up was to protect the reputation of the bank.\n\nOn September 23, RBI officials placed PMC Bank under directions, citing irregularities in lending loans to some companies for six months. The PMC Chairman Wareyam Singh was on the board of HDIL between 2006 and 2015 and had then joined PMC Bank as director was later elected as chairman of the bank.\n\nThe account holders were shocked when they learned about the restrictions as the directions allowed them to only withdraw Rs 1,000 in six months from their accounts. Many were shattered and disturbed leading protests across the state at PMC branches. RBI later increased the withdrawal limit to Rs 10,000.\n\nThe case against PMC Bank officials and HDIL chairman has been registered under sections 409, 420, 465, 471, 120 (B) of IPC.

Vijay Mallya,1,"Mallya had raised questions over the conditions of Indian jails during the extradition trial against him.\n\nThe Maharashtra Police has written to the state government, demanding a team of officials to be sent to study prisons in foreign nations. This exercise is meant to help create prisons as per the global standards in order to build a stronger case against fugitives like ENTITY and Nirav Modi.\n\nAccording to India Today, the Maharashtra Police has already submitted a letter to the government in this regard, and it is likely to be accepted. The police department has sought permission to visit jails in the United Kingdom, other European countries, or Israel to see how economic offenders are kept there.\n\nThe team will include police officials as well as personnel from Jail and Home ministries. The visiting officials will study norms set by European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, commonly called CPT standards, which are followed in European prisons.

Virat Kohli,0,"India's pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and their ace all-rounder Hardik Pandya have apparently been ruled out of Bangladesh-India Test series in November as both of them are set to leave for the UK to consult specialists physicians following their 'back problem,' report Indian media outlets.\n\nNews agency IANS adds:\n\nWhile Bumrah has already been ruled out till the Bangladesh series in November, the team management doesn't wish to take any chance and want to consult the best.\n\nSpeaking to IANS, a senior board functionary confirmed the development and said that Bumrah will be in the UK for a week to consult the doctors and take the necessary steps.\n\n\""Yes, he will be going to the UK in the first week of October and will be accompanied by Ashish Kaushik. They will look to get the best possible opinion in the matter. They will be checking with three doctors and the next plan of action will be decided after that,\"" the functionary said.\n\nEarlier, speaking to IANS, sources in the team management had said that the Bangladesh series is not in the radar for Bumrah as skipper ENTITY and coach Ravi Shastri want him to recover completely and return to action as India also have an eye on the 2020 World T20 in Australia next year and the pacer will be a vital cog in the line-up.\n\n\""You can say that the team is looking at Bumrah's return for the West Indies limited-over series. But the team management is very clear that they want no shortcuts and undergoing a proper rehab and returning fully fit is vital. The Bangladesh series would be too early,\"" the source explained.\n\nThis means that Bumrah will have no role to play in India's campaign in the World Test Championship this year.\n\nWith an eye on the upcoming World T20, India will be majorly playing limited-over cricket this year with the three Tests against South Africa and the two Tests against Bangladesh post the SA series being their only games in the longer format this year.\n\nHardik Pandya is set to leave for UK on Wednesday as he will get his back checked by the same doctor who treated him during India's tour of England in 2018 and the 2019 World Cup. This will be his third visit to the UK specialist as Pandya aggravated his back during the T20I series against South Africa.\n\nSpeaking to IANS, a senior board functionary said that Pandya has been consulting the UK specialist for the back issue that he has been facing and the doctor will now sit down with the all-rounder and discuss if they will go in for a surgery or take medicines to help recover from the back problem.\n\n\""Pandya had tried his best and worked on his fitness after the World Cup. But he aggravated it while playing in the T20I series against South Africa. He is flying off tomorrow and will sit down with the specialist and decide if he needs a surgery or medication will do.\n\n\""The specialist understands him as they have been in touch over the last couple of years. In fact, even when we were playing the World Cup, he paid a visit to the doctor to get his back checked. You have to understand that no athlete at the top level is a 100 per cent. They are always carrying some niggle or the other. The physio is there to help in that. But then, after a point, you need to take a call,\"" the functionary said.\n\nIn fact, he even cited the example of M.S. Dhoni and how he has always slept on the floor as he has a bad back. \""Take Dhoni's example. For the last 12 years, he has been sleeping on the floor and playing non-stop. You try and figure out ways to tackle situations because at the end of the day, nobody wants to be going under the knife,\"" the functionary said.\n\nAsked about Bumrah's situation, the functionary said: \""He is progressing well as his body is on auto-heal mode, but we don't wish to take any chance and that is why he is being sent to the UK for assessment. But things are looking much brighter. In fact, for those unaware, this was his second stress fracture as he healed automatically the first time."

He, like off-spinner Dane Piedt and debutant, didn't find much turn on an evidently tame pitch.

Virat Kohli,0,"10 years, that's the recurring theme in Pakistan cricket these days. A decade is a very long time in any field. Stars blossom and fade away in lesser time periods. With little more concerted effort, this theme can be translated into an ever-lasting, beautiful narrative, controlled by cricket. Without Pakistan, cricket will never be complete. To start with, on Monday, the 'international cricket,' the One-Day Internationals to be precise, returned to Pakistan. That can be read as the first chapter.\n\nLive Scorecard | Cricket News | Photos\n\nLast time the 1992 World Champions hosted an international series was way back in the Noughties, against the same opponents. Though, there was another series in between, in 2015 against Zimbabwe. But not many thought it was worthy of giving much thought, considering obvious reasons. By the way, they won it 2-1, but lost the preceding series, against Sri Lanka 1-2 with the visitors winning the finale at Lahore, where three Twenty20 Internationals will be played between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the next seven days. With so little international cricket happening in Pakistan, it is sometimes necessary to hark back to action-filled days, which will give a sense of continuity.\n\nAnd here's how it has continued, after a ten-year break. The first one got rained off, then Sarfaraz Ahmed & Co. produced a clinical performance, making everyone forget their pathetic World Cup outing. Now they are ready to tame the Lions again. In the second match, Babar Azam became the third-fastest batsman to score 11 ODI centuries, taking just 71 innings, behind South Africans - Hashim Amla (61) and Quinton de Kock (65). He could have won the man of the match award for bettering India captain ENTITY (82) in that particular race, considering the contempt et al. But it went to left-arm pacer Usman Shinwari, who claimed his second five-wicket haul.\n\nFor the visitors, gloom is the word that best defined their tour so far. They arrived in Pakistan on a gloomy day after a gloomy preparation then the gloom turned into despair. 300ish targets are normal these days. But at the first time of asking after whitewashing Bangladesh 3-0 at home, Sri Lankans found themselves in a pitiable situation - 5/28 in 61 balls. Then, as in every other gloomy tale, a silver lining flirted with them. The score became 205 without losing further wicket with a different Jayasuriya and Dasun Shanaka stitching a match-high stand of 177 runs. Then, believe it or not, petulant floodlights conspired against them at the National Stadium. Soon after two stoppages due to darkness, both the set batsmen got out, and it was all over in a jiffy. Expect another drama-filled match between two former World Champions today at Karachi.\n\nGet ball-by-ball commentary, live updates and live cricket score of third PAK vs SL ODI here:"
Virat Kohli,0,"#Final ODI: Babar Azam celebrated the return of ODI cricket in Pakistan with a superlative ton in the last match. He seems to be in Virat-Kohli like touch in ODIs and the ease with which he paces his innings, gives you the feeling that he has decoded the art of batting in ODIs. Sri Lankans would spend a lot of time discussing about him but that?s not the only concern the visitors have, their top-order was blown away by Usman Shinwari under conditions which are tailor-made for the top-order batsmen. And their fielding was pretty unlike Sri Lanka in the last game. It?s hard to imagine them defeating this Pakistan team but the 177-run partnership between Shehan Jayasuriya and Dasun Shanka will give them some self-belief. More than that, the unpredictability which Pakistan team is renowned for will give them some hope. The biggest disappointment in the last game was the crowd turnout. Hopefully, more people will be in present in the crowd today. Toss and team sheets in a bit.\n\nPreview:\n\nODI cricket in Karachi is synonymous with a storehouse of memorable matches. The drama of Waqar Younis running through West Indies' lower order with reverse swing to power the hosts to a tense win in 1990, or India's nail-biting triumph in 2005 is recounted from one generation to another. So, when ODI cricket returned to Karachi after 10 long years, there was excitement and witnesses of tales of past heroics. To make it a great day for home fans, Pakistan took a 1-0 lead with a comfortable 67-run victory in the second ODI versus Sri Lanka on Monday (September 30).\n\nAfter the first match was washed out due to persistent rain, the home team would have been pleased with their clinical show. Babar Azam continued to compile tall scores and ended up with his 11th ODI century. Meanwhile, Usman Shinwari, who hadn't played an ODI since March, found movement and attacked the stumps to pick up a five-for. Pakistan's batsmen also were able to adapt to the slow nature of the wicket. Azam, in particular, took his game to an elevated level by bisecting gaps at will. Iftikhar Ahmed, who mostly bats at number four for the Punjab Province in List A cricket, also showcased his skills with an aggressive hand lower down the order.\n\nAs the caravan moves over to the final ODI at the same stadium, the hosts still have a few worries. Sarfaraz Ahmed, the Pakistan skipper, hasn't been in good form in the 50-over format. The wicketkeeper-batsman didn't exactly have a good time in the World Cup, finishing with only one fifty and eked out just eight runs while batting in the slog overs in the second ODI versus Sri Lanka. The tourists, meanwhile, looked quite flat on the field. There were a string of misfields, with the stand-in skipper, Lahiru Thirimanne himself making a few errors. To make matters worse, the batting line-up crumbled as Sri Lanka slid to a pitiful 28 for 5 while chasing a sizeable 306.\n\nHowever, there is usually a silver lining in defeat, and that came in the form of the 177-run stand between Shehan Jayasuriya and Dasun Shanaka for the sixth wicket to take the tourists to a score of some respectability. Jayasuriya and Shanaka, who have played only 11 and 21 ODIs respectively, would certainly take enough positives from the game. Just that for Sri Lanka to draw the bilateral rubber 1-1, they need more players to step up and contribute.\n\nWhat: Pakistan vs Sri Lanka, 3rd ODI\n\nWhere: National Stadium, Karachi\n\nWhen: Wednesday, October 2 at 3 pm local\n\nWhat to expect: A rain shower or two is forecast in the morning before clearing up. The track is again expected to be on the slower side with the captain winning the toss set to bat first. The conditions for the second game were also conducive for old ball swing.\n\nTeam news:\n\nPakistan: Even though the likes of Mohammad Hasnain, the tearaway, and Asif Ali, the hard-hitting batsman, are waiting in the wings, the home team would be tempted to go in with the same side that triumphed in the second ODI.\n\nSri Lanka: Meanwhile, the tourists could tinker with the side, bringing in the tall seamer Kasun Rajitha in place of Nuwan Pradeep."
Virat Kohli,0,"Visakhapatnam: Rohit Sharma made a dream start as a Test opener, scoring an unbeaten 115 off 174 balls to take India to a commanding 202 for no loss at tea on day one of the series opener against South Africa here Wednesday.\n\nWhile South African bowlers did trouble the Indian batsmen on a few occasions in the first session, they seemed toothless in the afternoon session where Rohit and Mayank Agarwal (84 not out off 183) scored at a brisk rate.\n\nRohit, who got to his fifty before lunch, shifted gears and was particularly harsh on the spinners.\n\nHe hammered offie Danie Piedt for successive sixes over deep midwicket to get into the nineties before completing his fourth Test ton with a single off debutant spinner Senuran Muthusamy.\n\nThe entire dressing room including skipper ENTITY stood up to laud Rohit's feat. His unconquered innings comprised 12 fours and five sixes.\n\nAt the other end, Agarwal was cruising towards his maiden Test ton. He too looked assured at the crease and played his shots.\n\nEarly into the afternoon session, he brought up his half century with a spectacular six over extra cover off Keshav Maharaj.\n\nClouds gathered over the stadium towards the end of the session and thunderstorms forced the umpires to take the tea break eight minutes before scheduled time.\n\nEarlier, Rohit and Agarwal played out 30 overs in the morning session after safely negotiating the South African pacers Kagiso Rabada and Vernon Philander, taking India to 91 for no loss.\n\nIndia, who had named their playing on the eve of the first Test, opted to bat on a dry surface with skipper Kohli calling his decision a \""no brainer.\""\n\nExpecting the pitch to turn, South Africa picked three spinners in Maharaj, Piedt and Muthusamy, who is more of a batting all-rounder.\n\nAll eyes were expectedly on Rohit whose stop-start Test career has taken a new direction with the management accommodating him at the top of the order.\n\nHe left the first ball he faced before driving Rabada past backward point with minimal feet movement for a four.\n\nHis second scoring shot was also a boundary as he punched Philander towards backward point. The pitch offered very little to the pacers and spinners in the first two hours of play.\n\nWhat worked for Rohit was standing outside the crease when Philander was bowling to negate any little swing that was available.\n\nRabada has the express pace but he did not test the Indian openers as much as Philander.\n\nRohit and Philander's battle in the first hour was absorbing. Philander, who got the better of Rohit in the warm-up game, challenged Rohit by moving the ball both ways in his opening spell of four overs.\n\nAfter a few play and misses, Rohit chose to walk down the pitch before South Africa skipper Faf du Plessis asked wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock to stand up to the stumps.\n\nIndia reached 37 for 0 in 15 overs with Rohit and Agawal looking solid in the middle.\n\nAfter getting the measure of the surface, Rohit went for his strokes like he does in white-ball cricket.\n\nHis first big hit was a typical one as he gently stepped out of the crease to smash Maharaj over long-on. A little later, he played a similar short off Piedt, only this time the ball flew well above the long-on fielder.\n\nRohit completed his 11th Test half-century towards the end of the session but in a not so convincing fashion. He mistimed a sweep but fortunately it was not in the reach of the fielder and went for four."

PMC,1,"The RBI on Tuesday began its rate-setting huddle amid widespread expectations that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) headed by Governor Shaktikanta Das would slash benchmark interest rate to revive the sagging economy.\n\nThe Governor has already hinted that the benign inflation provides room for further monetary policy easing while space for fiscal space is limited.\n\nThe government has already announced a series of measures including steepest cut in corporate tax, rollback of enhanced surcharge on Foreign Portfolio Investors, among others to jump-start growth which hit a six-year low of 5 per cent during the first quarter of the current fiscal.\n\nThe six-member MPC is scheduled to announce the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy for 2019-20 on Friday, October 4, after a three-day meeting. There is no meeting of the panel due to national holiday on October 2, which marks birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nThe central bank has already slashed the repo rate four times consecutively this year amounting to 110 basis points in aggregate.\n\nAt its last meeting in August, the MPC reduced the benchmark lending rate by an unusual 35 basis points to 5.40 per cent.\n\nThe upcoming MPC meeting comes in the backdrop of the RBI's mandate to banks to link their loan products to an external benchmark, like repo rate, for faster transmission of reduction in policy rates to borrowers, from October 1.\n\nAhead of the meeting, the Das-headed Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) sub-committee took stock of the prevailing macroeconomic situation.\n\nEarlier, the RBI Governor had said the government has little fiscal space, giving hopes that the central bank may provide more monetary stimulus to prop up the economy.\n\nThe government's fiscal space has been squeezed on account of cut in rates of corporate tax as well as lowering of GST rate on various goods. Revenue collection too has been below the Budget estimates.\n\nExperts opine that another rate cut is on the cards as the government's hands are tied and the onus of taking initiatives now rests with the central bank.\n\nShanti Ekambaram, President, Consumer Banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said with inflation still within the RBI's medium-term target of 4 per cent, the MPC has the headroom to cut the repo rate further.\n\n\""However, the recent volatility in crude oil prices and the fiscal measures announced by the government will have an impact on inflation in the medium term and the fiscal deficit. Hence, we expect the MPC to be more measured in its response with a rate cut of 20-25 basis points in the October policy,\"" she said.\n\nAccording to NAREDCO president Niranjan Hiranandani, there is expectation of a further 50 basis points repo rate cut in the backdrop of muted inflation which stands lower than the expected 3.2 per cent.\n\nThe further reduction of repo rate will not only bring down the lending rates but also incentivise investment and boost consumption, he said.\n\nWhile economic activities are showing sings of sluggishness, the policy makers are drawing solace from the fact that retail inflation remains in the comfort zone of the central bank.\n\nRetail inflation inched up to 3.21 per cent in August but remained within the RBI's comfort zone. The RBI has been mandated by the government to ensure that inflation remains below 4 per cent, with deviation of 2 per cent on either side.\n\nExperts and industry feel low inflation provides enough headroom for the RBI to further lower the policy rate, especially when festive season has just started. People make huge purchases during Navratras and Diwali.\n\nWith liquidity concerns in the NBFC sector almost taken care of, the real estate sector too is hopeful that the RBI will go in for the much needed rate cut to boost demand for affordable housing.\n\nAlso Read | Indiabulls hits over five-year low, rattled by merger concerns and probe\n\nAlso Watch | ENTITY Bank crisis: Are cooperative banks being run without checks?"

The FIR names Thomas, ENTITY chairman Waryam Singh and the promoters of the HDIL and related entities.\n\n\""Since the bank was growing the statutory auditors, due to their time constraints, were checking only the incremental advances and not the entire operations in all the accounts,\"" Thomas claimed in the letter.\n\n\""The statutory auditors validated the incremental loans and advances and scrutinised the accounts which were shown to them by the bank,\"" he added.\n\nIn the past eight years, ENTITY had three statutory auditors -- Lakdawal & Co (FY19 and FY18); Ashok Jayesh & Associates (FY17, FY15, and FY11) and DB Ketkar & Co (FY14 and FY12).\n\nThomas confirmed that the exposure to the bankrupt HDIL Group continued to remain standard despite there was delay in repayments for over three years. The bank's exposure to HDIL Group was around Rs 6,500 crore as of September 19, 2019, he admitted in the letter.\n\nHe said some of the large accounts were not reported to the RBI from 2008 because of fear of reputational risks. \""The concealment of information from the board, auditors and regulators was due to the fear of reputational loss,\"" Thomas informed the RBI.\n\nHe said prior to 2015, a few top borrowers would be mostly checked as reported by the bank branch-wise, therefore those accounts did not come into the picture and it was around 2017 onwards when the RBI started asking for details of the advances.\n\nAfter being informed of the mess at the bank by a whistleblower on September 17, the Reserve Bank had on September 23 placed ENTITY under an administrator and suspended the management and also banned it from carrying out regular banking activities."
Narendra Modi,0,"When Martin Luther King Jr. visited the villa in Mumbai, India, where Mohandas Gandhi stayed in the 1920s, he had a special request: He wanted to spend the night in Gandhi's bedroom.\n\nIt was 1959, 11 years after Gandhi's death. The house, called Mani Bhavan, where the Indian leader taught followers to spin their own fabric and where he launched satyagraha -- his movement for truth and nonviolent resistance -- had been converted into a museum. In an austere top-floor room where Gandhi's mattress and shoes still lay, King said he could feel \""vibrations\"" of the Mahatma, or great soul.\n\n\""[King] was booked in a very good hotel. But he said, 'I am not going anywhere else. I am going to stay here, because I am getting vibrations of Gandhi,' \"" recalls curator Usha Thakkar.\n\nSo curators hauled in two cots, and the American civil rights leader and his wife, Coretta Scott King, slept the night next to Gandhi's vacant mattress. Afterward, Martin Luther King told All India Radio that he'd decided to adopt Gandhi's method of civil disobedience as his own.\n\nNow, six decades later, many black Africans are calling Gandhi a racist. #MeToo activists are questioning his sexual practices. Hindu nationalists are rejecting Gandhi's vision of a pluralistic India that is strengthened by diversity.\n\nGandhi is still revered. He helped win India freedom from British colonial rule in 1947. But as the world marks what would be his 150thbirthday on Wednesday, some of his habits and teachings are facing fresh scrutiny.\n\nThere's no way around it: Gandhi was a racist early in his life, says his biographer Ramachandra Guha.\n\n\""Gandhi as a young man went with the ideas of his culture and his time. He thought in his 20s that Europeans are the most civilized. Indians were almost as civilized, and Africans were uncivilized,\"" Guha, 61, told NPR in an interview in May at his home in Bengaluru, India.\n\n\""However, he outgrew his racism quite decisively, and for most of his life as a public figure, he was an anti-racist, talking for an end to discrimination of all kinds,\"" he said.\n\nThat included gender discrimination. Gandhi championed women in politics. But he was also obsessed with his own celibacy. In his late 70s, before he died at 78, he slept naked with his grandniece when she was in her late teens. He said he wanted to test his willpower to abstain from sex.\n\nNowadays, most people would call that abuse. Some question whether the young female was capable of giving consent as a minor to a man who was so revered and so much more powerful than she.\n\nIn 1962, when British filmmaker Richard Attenborough began researching what would become his 1982 Gandhi film, he asked Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, how he should portray his late colleague. Nehru famously replied that Gandhi was \""a great man, but he had his weaknesses, his moods and his failings.\"" He begged Attenborough not to turn Gandhi into a saint. He was \""much too human,\"" Nehru said.\n\nFather of the nation\n\nIn India, Gandhi is nevertheless treated as a saint -- the father of the nation. His birthday, Oct. 2, is a national holiday. Gandhi's face is on India's currency. His portrait hangs in government offices.\n\nPractically every major city in the country has at least one Gandhi memorial. At the garden in New Delhi where he was assassinated in 1948, just months after India's independence from Britain, tourists can stroll the stone walkway where Gandhi took his final steps.\n\n\""When people come here, they get highly emotional. Some of them have tears in their eyes and go back with a heavy heart,\"" says researcher Sailaja Gullapalli, giving NPR a tour. The garden and the house on its premises, now another Gandhi museum, get about 200,000 visitors a year.\n\nOn Gandhi's 150th birthday, events are planned across the globe: a vegetarian food festival in London and a walkathon for peace and tolerance in Dubai. Across India, schools are holding special assemblies and singing the freedom leader's favorite prayer songs. There are trash collection drives and a mass fabric-spinning session at the Mahatma's old Mumbai villa.\n\nBut India is also where the Mahatma may have fallen furthest from the pedestal.\n\nHindu nationalists in power\n\nThe man who assassinated Gandhi, Nathuram Godse, was a follower of Hindutva -- Hindu nationalism. Godse wanted India to be a Hindu country and objected to Gandhi's vision of India as a secular, pluralistic democracy. (India is about 80% Hindu but also has one of the world's largest Muslim populations, making up about 14% of the country, or around 180 million people.)\n\n\""The Hindutva type of ideology considered [Gandhi] to be an enemy because he was talking of secularism and not of Hinduism,\"" says Yogesh Kamdar, honorary secretary of the Mani Bhavan museum and the son of Indian freedom fighters.\n\nGandhi's vision won. When colonial India was partitioned in 1947, Hindu-majority India became a secular democracy, alongside the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\n\nBut Hindu nationalists are now in power in India. Some of them still don't accept Gandhi's vision. Like Godse, they want India to be a Hindu country. Some extremists among them even celebrate Gandhi's murder.\n\nMembers of a far-right Hindu group, the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha, shot and burned Gandhi's effigy on his death anniversary this year. In May, a parliamentary candidate from Prime Minister ENTITY's mainstream Bharatiya Janata Party called Gandhi's assassin, Godse, a \""patriot.\""\n\nThat shocked the country. The candidate, Pragya Thakur, was forced to apologize -- but nevertheless won her election. She is now a member of Parliament representing the central Indian city of Bhopal.\n\nThakur is an outlier though. Most Indian politicians admire Gandhi, and even those who don't have to tread very carefully.\n\n\""Very grudgingly, and maybe as a part of strategy, they have also adopted Gandhi as an icon. They had to!\"" says Kamdar. \""Otherwise it is very difficult to survive politically.\""\n\nModi is headlining events for the 150th anniversary. The Mahatma's signature round spectacles are the logo for Modi's Clean India campaign -- a national sanitation effort inspired by Gandhi.\n\nGandhi's philosophy\n\nOn weekends, crowds throng a park in New Delhi to pay their respects at the spot where Gandhi was cremated, called Raj Ghat. There's a long black marble slab covered in marigolds and topped with an eternal flame. The memorial inspires reverence, and also a few whispered debates about the Mahatma's legacy.\n\n\""It's gone nowadays. It's really gone,\"" tourist Ira Parikh, 44, says of Gandhi's swadeshi movement -- the idea that Indians should spin their own cloth and work in simple local industries. \""Few [people] are following these things anymore. I don't think it's practical.\""\n\nParikh says the historical figure's ideas can seem a bit quaint in booming, globalized India. Her two sons learn about him in school, but one of them says he struggles to see how those lessons apply to his own life.\n\n\""When someone says, 'Oh, he was great,' there's always some criticism,\"" says Harsh Parikh, 17, recounting debates with friends about Gandhi's tactics. \""Like, 'No, he could have got us freedom way before' [if he had been willing to use violence].\""\n\nWhat these teenagers are weighing is at the very heart of Gandhian philosophy: \""His absolute insistence on nonviolence, which young men see as pussyfooted and weak-kneed and -- dare I say -- feminine and hence not macho enough,\"" says Guha, the biographer.\n\nGandhi's restraint can look naive in today's India, confronted with terrorism. Modi has sought to portray himself as a strong pair of hands who isn't afraid to strike at neighboring Pakistan if provoked. (Both countries have nuclear weapons.)\n\n\""Palace of cards\""\n\nAt the other memorial across New Delhi, in the garden where Gandhi was shot dead, a 76-year-old man sits with a spinning wheel. He comes every Friday, he says, because Gandhi was assassinated on a Friday.\n\nA retired civil servant, Musaddilal Gupta escapes modern India for about an hour a week \""as a tribute to him,\"" he says. A few steps from where Gandhi died, Gupta spins his own thread -- as the Mahatma taught.\n\n\""When this becomes cloth and when I wear it, it's a feeling of joy, to produce something yourself,\"" Gupta says. \""His principles are so strong! You may or may not accept it.\""\n\n\""But the day will come when this palace of cards will fall,\"" he says, \""and Gandhian principles will remain."
Narendra Modi,0,"India is to be declared \""open-defecation free\"" by prime minister ENTITY on Wednesday evening, although experts question his bold claim that all 1.3 billion people in the country have access to a toilet.\n\nModi made his \""latrines for all\"" pledge when he first assumed office in 2014 and is hailing the project's success as India celebrates the 150th anniversary of the birth of independence hero Mahatma Gandhi, a sanitation champion.\n\nSince being elected, Modi's government says it has built almost 100 million toilets, winning the leader plaudits abroad, including an award from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation last week.\n\nIn March, the government had said fewer than 50 million people relieved themselves outside, down from 550 million in 2014, with more than 550,000 villages declared open-defecation free.\n\nHowever, experts are sceptical over his claims, citing data from rural as well as urban areas.\n\n\""A lot of latrines have been constructed from 2014 to 2018. Latrine ownership increased from about 35 percent to about 70 percent,\"" said Sangita Vyas from the Research Institute for Compassionate Economics (RICE).\n\n\""That increase did accelerate the reduction of open defecation but in December 2018 we estimated about half of people in the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan still defecated in the open,\"" she told AFP, doubting that the shortfall has been made up since.\n\nMany of the toilets that have been constructed are without a water connection and even when they are connected, cultural barriers stop many Indians from using them, experts say.\n\n'Gandhi's dream'\n\nModi, 69, was set to make the grand announcement in his western home state of Gujarat on Wednesday evening in front of 20,000 village chiefs.\n\nHe was also due to visit the Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat, where Gandhi based himself for many years, and where 10,000 jars of treated human faecal matter were to be handed to guests, the Indian Express daily reported.\n\nThe nutrient-rich matter -- sun-dried, sieved into a tea leaf-like consistency and packed into the glass jars together with seeds -- will then sprout upon watering.\n\nBefore that, Modi early on Wednesday paid his respects to Gandhi, who was assassinated the year after India gained independence from Britain in 1947, at the Raj Ghat memorial in New Delhi.\n\nHe said on Twitter that India was expressing \""gratitude to Mahatma Gandhi for his everlasting contribution to humanity. We pledge to continue working hard to realise his dreams and create a better planet.\""\n\nOther events also took place nationwide including in a hospital room in Pune where Gandhi was operated on for appendicitis in 1924.\n\nAs many as 600 prisoners were also set to be released in an amnesty, media reports said.\n\nLater on Wednesday, a year-long, 14,000-kilometre (8,700-mile) \""global peace\"" march was due to leave Delhi bound for Switzerland and taking in 10 countries."

This was days after his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi was reported to have been marooned at his home for three days."

Fadnavis himself will be addressing as many as 60 rallies across the length and breadth of the state in the upcoming days.\n\nIt should be noted that Fadnavis is the first CM of the state of Maharashtra in about five decades to have completed an entire term and is aiming to get re-elected. The BJP led by him is likely to contest the polls on over 155-162 seats, while the Shiv Sena is expected to contest the polls in other 126 seats."

In an austere top-floor room where Gandhi's mattress and shoes still lay, King said he could feel \""vibrations\"" of the Mahatma, or great soul.\n\n\""[King] was booked in a very good hotel. But he said, 'I am not going anywhere else. I am going to stay here, because I am getting vibrations of Gandhi,' \"" recalls curator Usha Thakkar.\n\nSo curators hauled in two cots, and the American civil rights leader and his wife, Coretta Scott King, slept the night next to Gandhi's vacant mattress. Afterward, Martin Luther King told All India Radio that he'd decided to adopt Gandhi's method of civil disobedience as his own.\n\nNow, six decades later, many black Africans are calling Gandhi a racist. #MeToo activists are questioning his sexual practices. Hindu nationalists are rejecting Gandhi's vision of a pluralistic India that is strengthened by diversity.\n\nGandhi is still revered. He helped win India freedom from British colonial rule in 1947. But as the world marks what would be his 150thbirthday on Wednesday, some of his habits and teachings are facing fresh scrutiny.\n\nThere's no way around it: Gandhi was a racist early in his life, says his biographer Ramachandra Guha.\n\n\""Gandhi as a young man went with the ideas of his culture and his time. He thought in his 20s that Europeans are the most civilized. Indians were almost as civilized, and Africans were uncivilized,\"" Guha, 61, told NPR in an interview in May at his home in Bengaluru, India.\n\n\""However, he outgrew his racism quite decisively, and for most of his life as a public figure, he was an anti-racist, talking for an end to discrimination of all kinds,\"" he said.\n\nThat included gender discrimination. Gandhi championed women in politics. But he was also obsessed with his own celibacy. In his late 70s, before he died at 78, he slept naked with his grandniece when she was in her late teens. He said he wanted to test his willpower to abstain from sex.\n\nNowadays, most people would call that abuse. Some question whether the young female was capable of giving consent as a minor to a man who was so revered and so much more powerful than she.\n\nIn 1962, when British filmmaker Richard Attenborough began researching what would become his 1982 Gandhi film, he asked Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, how he should portray his late colleague. Nehru famously replied that Gandhi was \""a great man, but he had his weaknesses, his moods and his failings.\"" He begged Attenborough not to turn Gandhi into a saint. He was \""much too human,\"" Nehru said.\n\nFather of the nation\n\nIn India, Gandhi is nevertheless treated as a saint -- the father of the nation. His birthday, Oct. 2, is a national holiday. Gandhi's face is on India's currency. His portrait hangs in government offices.\n\nPractically every major city in the country has at least one Gandhi memorial. At the garden in New Delhi where he was assassinated in 1948, just months after India's independence from Britain, tourists can stroll the stone walkway where Gandhi took his final steps.\n\n\""When people come here, they get highly emotional. Some of them have tears in their eyes and go back with a heavy heart,\"" says researcher Sailaja Gullapalli, giving NPR a tour. The garden and the house on its premises, now another Gandhi museum, get about 200,000 visitors a year.\n\nOn Gandhi's 150th birthday, events are planned across the globe: a vegetarian food festival in London and a walkathon for peace and tolerance in Dubai. Across India, schools are holding special assemblies and singing the freedom leader's favorite prayer songs. There are trash collection drives and a mass fabric-spinning session at the Mahatma's old Mumbai villa.\n\nBut India is also where the Mahatma may have fallen furthest from the pedestal.\n\nHindu nationalists in power\n\nThe man who assassinated Gandhi, Nathuram Godse, was a follower of Hindutva -- Hindu nationalism. Godse wanted India to be a Hindu country and objected to Gandhi's vision of India as a secular, pluralistic democracy. (India is about 80% Hindu but also has one of the world's largest Muslim populations, making up about 14% of the country, or around 180 million people.)\n\n\""The Hindutva type of ideology considered [Gandhi] to be an enemy because he was talking of secularism and not of Hinduism,\"" says Yogesh Kamdar, honorary secretary of the Mani Bhavan museum and the son of Indian freedom fighters.\n\nGandhi's vision won. When colonial India was partitioned in 1947, Hindu-majority India became a secular democracy, alongside the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\n\nBut Hindu nationalists are now in power in India. Some of them still don't accept Gandhi's vision. Like Godse, they want India to be a Hindu country. Some extremists among them even celebrate Gandhi's murder.\n\nMembers of a far-right Hindu group, the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha, shot and burned Gandhi's effigy on his death anniversary this year. In May, a parliamentary candidate from Prime Minister ENTITY's mainstream Bharatiya Janata Party called Gandhi's assassin, Godse, a \""patriot.\""\n\nThat shocked the country. The candidate, Pragya Thakur, was forced to apologize -- but nevertheless won her election. She is now a member of Parliament representing the central Indian city of Bhopal.\n\nThakur is an outlier though. Most Indian politicians admire Gandhi, and even those who don't have to tread very carefully.\n\n\""Very grudgingly, and maybe as a part of strategy, they have also adopted Gandhi as an icon. They had to!\"" says Kamdar. \""Otherwise it is very difficult to survive politically.\""\n\nModi is headlining events for the 150th anniversary. The Mahatma's signature round spectacles are the logo for Modi's Clean India campaign -- a national sanitation effort inspired by Gandhi.\n\nGandhi's philosophy\n\nOn weekends, crowds throng a park in New Delhi to pay their respects at the spot where Gandhi was cremated, called Raj Ghat. There's a long black marble slab covered in marigolds and topped with an eternal flame. The memorial inspires reverence, and also a few whispered debates about the Mahatma's legacy.\n\n\""It's gone nowadays. It's really gone,\"" tourist Ira Parikh, 44, says of Gandhi's swadeshi movement -- the idea that Indians should spin their own cloth and work in simple local industries. \""Few [people] are following these things anymore. I don't think it's practical.\""\n\nParikh says the historical figure's ideas can seem a bit quaint in booming, globalized India. Her two sons learn about him in school, but one of them says he struggles to see how those lessons apply to his own life.\n\n\""When someone says, 'Oh, he was great,' there's always some criticism,\"" says Harsh Parikh, 17, recounting debates with friends about Gandhi's tactics. \""Like, 'No, he could have got us freedom way before' [if he had been willing to use violence].\""\n\nWhat these teenagers are weighing is at the very heart of Gandhian philosophy: \""His absolute insistence on nonviolence, which young men see as pussyfooted and weak-kneed and -- dare I say -- feminine and hence not macho enough,\"" says Guha, the biographer.\n\nGandhi's restraint can look naive in today's India, confronted with terrorism. Modi has sought to portray himself as a strong pair of hands who isn't afraid to strike at neighboring Pakistan if provoked. (Both countries have nuclear weapons.)\n\n\""Palace of cards\""\n\nAt the other memorial across New Delhi, in the garden where Gandhi was shot dead, a 76-year-old man sits with a spinning wheel. He comes every Friday, he says, because Gandhi was assassinated on a Friday.\n\nA retired civil servant, Musaddilal Gupta escapes modern India for about an hour a week \""as a tribute to him,\"" he says. A few steps from where Gandhi died, Gupta spins his own thread -- as the Mahatma taught.\n\n\""When this becomes cloth and when I wear it, it's a feeling of joy, to produce something yourself,\"" Gupta says. \""His principles are so strong! You may or may not accept it.\""\n\n\""But the day will come when this palace of cards will fall,\"" he says, \""and Gandhian principles will remain.4"
Narendra Modi,0,"New Delhi, Oct 2 (IANS) On the 150th anniversary of the Father of the Nation, Congress' Interim President Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday launched a veiled attack on the ruling BJP, saying the country is being taken towards their \""own direction\"" in the name of Mahatma Gandhi even though \""those doing politics of falsehood will not understand\"" what he preached.\n\nSonia Gandhi, who was addressing party leaders and workers outside Mahatma Gandhi's memorial Rajghat here, insisted that her party is his true follower and believes in his ideology.\n\nShe said Mahatma Gandhi is the symbol of India \""but those who want RSS to become India's symbol will not understand what Gandhiji thought about multiculturalism.\""\n\nIn an apparent attack on the BJP, Sonia Gandhi said, \""those who are doing politics of falsehood will not understand that Gandhiji was worshipper of truth and non violence. Those who want all the powers in their hands, will not understand what Gandhiji thought about Swarajya.\""\n\nEmphasising that \""it's not easy to follow the footsteps of Gandhiji\"", the Congress leader said, \""This is not the first time that people, using the name of Gandhiji, want to take everyone towards their own direction.

A Congress leader said it symbolised the importance of Khadi and acharkha' in the freedom movement. Scores of party leaders and workers participated in the march, which was earlier supposed to be led by Sonia Gandhi. But she could not do so because of her health issues and Rahul led it in her place.The party organised padyatras across the country on Wednesday to spread the message of Gandhian ideology.Leading a march in Lucknow, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi said, \""Mahatma Gandhi taught truth. BJP should follow it first.\""\n\nCongress is locked in a tug of war with BJP over the issue of Mahatma Gandhi's legacy. The BJP, led by Prime Minister ENTITY, is vigorously pursuing programmes to pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi."
Donald Trump,0,"Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) has promoted at least four racially charged hoaxes or debunked stories on Twitter in 2019 and failed to issue statements retracting or correcting her comments.\n\nThe most recent example: the case of Amari Allen, a black 12-year-old girl in Virginia who claimed three white boys in her class pinned her down and cut off her dreadlocks. Allen has since recanted the story, but Tlaib has not issued a correction or deleted her tweet praising Allen as \courageous & strong\"" and having a \""power that threatens their core.\""\n\nThe activist Tlaib retweeted apologized for spreading the story after Allen recanted her charge, but Tlaib didn't share the apology or offer her own contrition.\n\nThis has been part of a pattern for the outspoken, far-left congresswoman. On at least three other occasions in 2019, Tlaib uncritically shared racially charged, viral stories that fell apart or were strongly challenged upon deeper scrutiny.\n\nTlaib was among numerous progressive politicians and pundits who rushed to judgment about the Covington Catholic incident in January at the Lincoln Memorial. Initial videos and media reports made it seem as though Trump-supporting high schoolers had mocked and harassed a Native American man peacefully beating a drum, but further investigation revealed severe inaccuracies in those assumptions.\n\n\""This is so hard to watch,\"" Tlaib tweeted, linking to one of the early videos. \""It reminds us of the growing hate & oppression we are all up against.\""\n\nTlaib shared a GQ article on Jan. 30 initially headlined, \""The Racist, Homophobic Attack on Jussie Smollett Is Far-Right America's Endgame,\"" the day after the Empire actor claimed masked ENTITY supporters attacked him in Chicago, hurled racial and homophobic epithets, and put a noose around his neck.\n\n\""America's choice to embrace the blind rage of late-stage whiteness in decline is an explicit longing for this kind..."

Donald Trump,0,"Everywhere you turn progressives are pushing the idea of diversity. It's in our school curriculum, in every TV show and movie, and now even in corporate commercials. But within the era of Newspeak, what is now called diversity is actual progressive dogmatic orthodoxy. The only permitted diversity is in the narrow, acceptable progressive doctrine. It is acceptable to hold any opinion on the number of human genders if that number is greater than twelve. The current politically acceptable number is one hundred twelve. To say there are only two genders will get you send to re-education camp, or diversity training, and subjected to the two minutes of hate.\n\nThe progressive movement today is a bastardization of what it once was. A good friend who is Dean at a prominent university is one of the first people I know who described himself thirty years ago as a progressive. Today, he shuns the term, saying it has been corrupted.\n\nProfessors lose or are denied tenure and teaching positions for thinking outside of the approved dogma. Social media posts outside of the acceptable progressive doctrine will get you gagged and shut down.

Donald Trump,0,"Murder is on the decline in America, according to a new FBI report.\n\nThe nation's top federal law enforcement agency found that homicides fell by 6 percent in 2018. The decline in homicides is part of a 3 percent drop in the violent crime rate, according to the Uniform Crime Report, the FBI's annual tally of crimes reported to local police departments. The 2018 decline follows several years of slight increases in homicide and violent crime, driven largely by spikes in major cities such as Chicago and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe drop may represent a continuation of America's long-running crime decline, or of the aggressive tactics of President ENTITY's Department of Justice. The relatively small magnitude of the decline, especially in light of other evidence, suggests America may have reached a new normal for violent crime rates.\n\nOverall, violent crime rates fell by just under 4 percent, from 383.8 offenses per 100,000 people to 368.9, the report shows. That decline reflects not just the 6 percent reduction in the homicide rate, but also decreases in the robbery and aggravated assault rates. Among violent crimes, only the rate of rapes increased, rising from 41.7 rapes per 100,000 people to 42.6. The property crime rate fell for the 19th consecutive year.\n\nThe drop in the homicide rate, in particular, represents a significant change for the nation.

Donald Trump,0,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - The House Ways and Means Committee received information from a federal employee at the end of July alleging that there was \""possible misconduct\"" and \""inappropriate efforts to influence\"" the Presidential audit program, according to a letter from the committee's chairman.\n\nCommittee Chairman Richard Neal is suing the US Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service to obtain six years of President ENTITY tax returns as well as records from several of his business entities. The Presidential tax audit program, conducted by the IRS, automatically audits every incoming President's taxes and Neal has argued that he wants the records to make sure the Presidential tax audit program is working properly or if necessary make legislative fixes.\n\nTrump and his defenders have argued there is no legislative purpose for the committee to have access to Trump's returns and that Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, is only interested in getting information that could be damaging to the President.\n\nNeal wrote to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about the complaint, and included a version of the letter in an August court document.\n\nNeal said in his letter to Mnuchin that the allegation underscores the need for oversight of the program. The House has argued it needs the information to understand how the Presidential audit program, which is not enshrined in law and is shrouded in mystery, is carried out. Democrats argue that any allegation that the program was carried out differently under Trump could bolster the House's case.\n\n\""On July 29, 2019, the Committee received an unsolicited communication from a Federal employee setting forth credible allegations of 'evidence of possible misconduct'-specifically, potential 'inappropriate efforts to influence' the mandatory audit program,\"" Neal wrote in his letter to Mnuchin dated August 8. \""This is a grave charge that appreciably heightens the Committee's concerns about the absence of appropriate safeguards as part of the mandatory audit program and whether statutory codification of such program or other remedial, legislative measures are warranted.\""\n\nThe allegation, which came in a little-noticed court filing as part of the ongoing fight in court for Trump's tax returns, has come under renewed scrutiny following a separate whistleblower from the intelligence community who issued a complaint charging that the President had used his office \""to solicit interference\"" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election and then that the White House took steps to conceal the efforts.\n\n\""I can't get into the specifics of the whistleblower because that's something Chairman Neal will have to address, but it is clear that the information that we are getting strengthens our concern and our argument that the President may not be subjected to the laws that the IRS is supposed to enforce,\"" said Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Michigan and a member of the House Ways and Means committee, in an interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow on \""Newsroom\"" Tuesday.\n\nThe administration previously told the Committee that no individual would face backlash for carrying out an audit, but Neal wrote in his letter to Mnuchin that \""the allegations received by the Committee cast doubt on this statement and underscore the pressing need for complete and meaningful oversight of the mandatory audit program.\""\n\nTrump has for years repeatedly refused to release his tax returns -- dating back to his days before he was in office and on the campaign trail -- breaking with decades of precedent of presidential candidates from both parties releasing tax returns as well as other personal financial documents."

Donald Trump,0,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Australia's prime minister said Wednesday that his country is unlikely to provide the United States with internal government communications with an Australian diplomat who is partially responsible for triggering the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 American presidential election.\n\nPresident ENTITY recently asked Prime Minister Scott Morrison and other foreign leaders to help U.S. Attorney General William Barr with an investigation into the origins of the Russia probe that was triggered in part by a tip from an Australian diplomat, Alexander Downer.\n\nMorrison said he had agreed to cooperate with the inquiry during a phone conversation with Trump last month.\n\nBut Morrison indicated Australia was unlikely to provide Downer's diplomatic communications about the matter to the U.S. investigators.\n\n\""It would be a very unusual thing to do and Australia would never do anything that would prejudice our national interest,\"" Morrison told Sky News Australia.\n\nThe revelation this week that Trump had asked world leaders for help Barr's investigation underscores the extent to which the president remains consumed by special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, and the ways in which he has used the apparatus of the United States government to investigate what he believes are its politically motivated origins. It also highlights Barr's hands-on role in leading that investigation, including traveling overseas for personal meetings with foreign law enforcement officials.\n\nTrump's interactions with foreign leaders -- and Barr's role in those discussions -- are under heightened scrutiny now that the U.S. House of Representatives has launched an impeachment inquiry into the president. The probe centers on Trump's call this summer with Ukraine's president, revealed by a whistleblower CIA intelligence officer, in which Trump presses for help investigating Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nAustralia's ambassador to Washington had formally offered Australia's help with the investigation back in May.\n\nMorrison on Wednesday described his September phone call with Trump as a \""fairly uneventful conversation.\""\n\n\""The president contacted me and asked for a point of contact between the Australian government and the U.S. attorney, which I was happy to do on the basis that it was something we had already committed to do,\"" Morrison said.\n\n\""It would have been, I think, frankly more surprising had we chosen not to cooperate,\"" he added.\n\nMorrison said Trump did not phrase the request as a \""favor.\""\n\n\""I've had many conversations with the president and it was a very brief conversation and it was not one that I'd characterize as being laden with pressure,\"" Morrison said.\n\n\""It was a fairly polite request for something the Australian government had already made pretty clear we were happy to do,\"" Morrison added.\n\nThe opposition has questioned whether Morrison is drawing Australia into a U.S. domestic political battle and has demanded a transcript of the phone conversation.\n\nForeign Minister Marise Payne said whether a transcript was made public was a question for the United States."

AL CARDINAL Investments,0,"Vatileaks is turning into the Vatican's own horror movie franchise.\n\nI couldn't help thinking of the \Scream\"" franchise of postmodern slasher films on Thursday, especially where in each movie, film nerd Randy gives the \""rules\"" for a series in the horror genre.\n\nAnd in Rome, we are about to get the third part of the biggest horror franchise at the Vatican: The Vatileaks saga.\n\nThe first part - the original Vatileaks - was when Pope Benedict XVI's butler Paolo Gabriele stole documents from the pontiff, which were then given to Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi, who published them in 2012's His Holiness: The Secret Papers of Benedict XVI. The book revealed financial corruption in the Vatican, curial infighting, and was the first starring role of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, the nuncio who last year accused Pope Francis of covering up for now ex-ENTITY Theodore McCarrick.\n\nNuzzi was also the impetus for Vatileaks II - In 2015's Merchants in the Temple, he used documents and tapes leaked by members of a Vatican commission on financial reform to shine a light on the fierce opposition to the efforts to clean up the Vatican's opaque economics.\n\nAccording to the \""Scream\"" franchise a sequel has rules: 1) The body count is always bigger; 2) The death scenes are always much more elaborate; 3) and never, ever, under any circumstances assume the killer is dead.\n\nAnd, boy, did Vatileaks II deliver!\n\nWhile the original Vatileaks saw Gabriele and his accomplice quickly convicted (and pardoned), Vatileaks II had a monsignor, a pregnant woman, an aid, and two journalists (Nuzzi and Emiliano Fittipaldi) in the dock. And while Gabriele just swiped documents, Vatileaks II included illicitly accessed computer files and even a secret recording of the pope. As for the part about \""assuming the killer is dead,\"" that is where we are now.\n\nVatileaks III started at the beginning of October, when the Vatican Gendarmes raided the offices of the powerful Secretariat of State.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, the raid was connected to a $200 million shadowy property investment in London that turned out to be a bad deal for the Vatican, but a very good deal for the man who arranged it.\n\nWhen the Italian newsweekly L'Espresso leaked a memo from the Vatican police barring five employees from entering Vatican territory, it led to the resignation of the long serving head of the gendarmes, Domenico Giani.\n\nBut that's not the end of it - Randy has rules for the third film of a trilogy, too: There will be a killer \""who's gonna be superhuman\""; Anyone can die; and the past will come back to \""bite you in the [rear]\"" - \""Any sins you think were committed in the past are about to break out and destroy you.\""\n\nSo how is Vatileaks III's first act shaping up? Pretty much according to the \""Scream\"" outline.\n\nOn Thursday, the Financial Times published an expose of the London property deal at the center of the current Vatican scandal: a building in London's prestigious Chelsea neighborhood that is scheduled to be transformed into luxury flats.\n\nFollowing the paper trail, the UK newspaper discovered that from 2014, the Vatican's Secretariat of State - using private banks and shell companies - bought up a 45 percent stake in the property, costing around $200 million.\n\nAlthough the Vatican has long invested in the London property market - a sure thing in recent decades - the Chelsea deal was hit by the uncertainty of Brexit, leading the Vatican to seek to buy the building outright to recoup its losses. How much it paid in the end is unknown, and work on the project has still not begun.\n\nHowever, not everyone was a loser in the deal. The Financial Times reports that Raffaele Mincione, an Italian former banker who arranged the deal, made over $150 million in profits, not only from selling the building (which he owned at the time), but by charging the Vatican millions of dollars in fees to manage the deal. The newspaper reports that Mincione also sold bonds to the Vatican to raise funds for his unrelated projects.\n\nAt the center of the controversy is now-ENTITY Giovanni Angelo Becciu, who at the time of the deal was serving as the Substitute for General Affairs in the Secretariat of State, a high-ranking position analogous to the pope's chief of staff.\n\nThe Financial Times reports the deal was made under Becciu's supervision and with his approval, and the newspaper questions why he would have agreed to the terms proposed by Mincione.\n\nHe was created a ENTITY, and then made head of the Vatican's saint making office, in June 2018 - just before the Vatican sent an official to London to buy the Chelsea property outright.\n\nBut the Financial Times report seems to only be the pre-credits taster for Vatileaks III -- L'Espresso has announced it has received the Vatican magistrate's documentation on the case, which it will be publishing on Sunday.\n\nIn a preview published Thursday, the magazine said Vatican prosecutors identified \""serious indications of embezzlement, fraud, abuse of office, money laundering,\"" and other financial crimes, with another report noting \""very serious crimes such as embezzlement, corruption and abetting.\""\n\nThe Italian magazine says Becciu is not the only one under the microscope: It claims his successor and current Substitute, Venezuelan Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra, is also under scrutiny.\n\nThe L'Espresso report also promises to shine a light on the tens of millions of dollars of fees paid to Mincione and other financiers who advise the Secretariat of State on its investments, many of them of a dubious nature.\n\nOf course, in the background of the story is the fact that most of the financial reforms of the Vatican - many instituted because of the issues brought to light in the previous Vatileaks scandals - have stalled. The Secretariat for the Economy - already cut down a bit even before its head, ENTITY George Pell, went to Australia to unsuccessfully fight historic charges of child sex abuse - has been without a new boss for over two years. The Vatican's first-ever auditor general, Libero Milone, was fired in 2017, accused by Becciu of spying on his superiors. He, too, hasn't been replaced.\n\nThis is all just the first act Vatileaks III: On Monday, a new book is coming out promising to expose the full extent of Vatican financial malpractice.\n\nIts title is Universal Judgement, and its author is none other than Gianluigi Nuzzi.\n\nAccording to the \""Scream\"" theory, anything can happen in the third film of a trilogy, so there's no telling how Vatileaks III will play out - but for any Vatican official who thinks that weathering this storm will bring an end to the drama, there's bad news.\n\nScream 3 didn't end the trilogy: Not only was there a Scream 4, eventually they made a television series. The Vatican is hoping that their franchise doesn't follow the same formula."
AL CARDINAL Investments,0,"\Say it nicer.\"" No words better sum up the news coverage of Hunter Biden. That instruction from him to ABC News reporter Amy Robach came after she noted that he was \""in and out of rehab\"" several times for dependency on drugs ranging from cocaine to crack. In fact, the media has been \""saying it nicer\"" for weeks, telling readers and viewers there is \""no finding of wrongdoing\"" by Joe BidenJoe BidenWarren defends, Buttigieg attacks in debate that shrank the field Five takeaways from the Democratic debate in Ohio New study: Full-scale 'Medicare for All' costs trillion over 10 years MORE's son while avoiding any substantive discussion of his controversial business dealings.\n\nDuring the ABC News interview, Hunter Biden moved between muted apologies and indignant denials about alleged efforts to cash in on his father's position. The interview was galling for those critical of this common form of corruption. For three decades, I have written about the practice of giving lucrative jobs and contracts to the spouses and children of powerful politicians as a way of gaining influence in Washington.\n\nHunter Biden's deals are textbook examples of how political families become rich from public service. Nevertheless, many in the media continue to repeat Joe Biden's position that \""no one has asserted my son did a single thing wrong.\"" That, of course, is untrue. Even if Hunter Biden's deals did not amount to crimes, they were wrong. They have always been wrong, but both parties have always protected these deals as a dirty little secret.\n\nHunter seemed to struggle to find his identity in explaining his deals. He was asked why he accompanied his father on an official trip to China in 2013, shortly before he signed a deal with the Bank of China to manage as much as $1.5 billion in investments. \""I have traveled everywhere with my dad,\"" he replied. The problem is that he was 43 years old at the time. He was not some oversized lap child.\n\nBut after admitting that he probably was given such lucrative deals because of his dad, he then suggested the opposite. Pressed about his credentials to be a director of a Ukrainian energy company, he said, \""I was vice chairman of the board of Amtrak for five years. I was the chairman of the board of the United Nations World Food Program. I was a lawyer for Boies Schiller Flexner, one of the most prestigious law firms in the world.\""\n\nIndeed, he was given all of those positions, but they raise the same concerns over whether he earned them. Hunter Biden has the prototypical resume of the progeny of the powerful in Washington. He seemed to land jobs far beyond his experience or proven skills. Most law school graduates work for six years just to make junior partner in a firm. Yet, directly out of law school in 1996, he was given a lucrative position with MBNA America, a bank holding company that was not only a campaign contributor to his father but a business actively lobbying for lending changes in Congress. His father, then a powerful senator in Congress, supported changes that benefited the company.\n\nAnd, within a couple years of graduating, Hunter Biden had amazingly ascended to the position of executive vice president. He then was given a position in the Commerce Department before he became a high paid lobbyist. In 2006, President Bush made Hunter Biden a member of the board of directors of Amtrak; no one seriously argued at the time that his resume even remotely qualified him for that position, any more than his assuming the board chairmanship of the U.N. World Food Program.\n\nAt the time, Democratic Senator Tom Carper of Delaware said Hunter Biden was qualified in being put on the board of Amtrak because \""Hunter Biden has spent a lot of time on Amtrak trains.\"" He later was given a position with the law firm of Boies Schiller Flexner while he was establishing an investment firm. Frankly, his resume is filled with high-paying positions but few known accomplishments to justify them.\n\nIn a key exchange, ABC's Robach asked about Hunter Biden going with his father on an official trip to China. Shortly after that trip on Air Force II, Biden signed a deal with Chinese businessman Jonathan Li and BHR Partners to invest as much as $1.5 billion in Chinese capital, including funding from the government-supported Bank of China. Robach correctly noted that President TrumpDonald John TrumpWarren defends, Buttigieg attacks in debate that shrank the field Five takeaways from the Democratic debate in Ohio Democrats debate in Ohio: Who came out on top? MORE is completely wrong in claiming that Biden walked away with $1.5 billion or made millions from the deal. Indeed, Biden insisted he has not made a dime on the deal.\n\nRobach, however, then moved on without addressing the obvious point: Hunter Biden hoped to get a percentage of a business that was seeking $1.5 billion. He simply failed in the effort. Saying that you failed to make a ton of money hardly gives you the ethical high ground by default. Hunter also brushed over the fact that, on the official visit, he had his father take a photo with Li, his business partner. He insisted it was all a wonderful coincidence of a \""friend\"" staying at the same hotel. Nor was he pressed on why, if his deal made no money for years, he just got around to resigning this month.\n\nHunter did admit that his deal with Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian energy company, may have shown \""poor judgment\"" -- but not because it was an obvious effort at influence peddling. Nor because he took $50,000 a month from one of Ukraine's most corrupt figures. Or because he got the deal when his father controlled potentially billions in U.S. loans and aid to Ukraine. No, he said, it was because \""I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That is where I made the mistake.\""\n\nIn other words, he broke the ENTITY rule of the progeny of the powerful: Never allow your personal enrichments to become public controversies. Ultimately, the real impact of this controversy turns on any responsibility of Joe Biden. In his interview, Hunter Biden insisted: \""I didn't have any discussions with my father before or after I joined the board as it related to it, other than that brief exchange that we had.\""\n\nRobach repeated that denial while ignoring the obvious contraction in Joe Biden's earlier categorical denial of any knowledge of his son's dealings. This is where the spin moves from nice to nonsense. The point of the original question to Joe Biden was whether he knew his son was doing business in Ukraine when the vice president dangled more than $1 billion in loans in front of the Ukrainian government. The senior Biden categorically denied any knowledge: \""I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\""\n\nThe Washington Post adopted this spin in its dubious \""fact check\"" in which it acknowledged that Hunter did tell his father about the dealings -- but, since Joe Biden just told his son to be \""careful,\"" the Post concluded \""that's not much of a discussion.\"" That is not the point, however. The point is that Joe Biden knew of a glaring conflict in what anyone would recognize as an effort at influence peddling.\n\nIn response to all of this, Joe Biden has declared: \""I can tell you now, if I am your president -- next president -- I'm going to build on the squeaky clean, transparent environment that we had in the Obama-Biden White House.\"" That is a rather odd statement since his son's controversial deals in Ukraine and China occurred during that administration, as did controversial payments to the Clintons and their foundation from foreign interests. That is not exactly the model many of us have in mind. In the end, it is hard to say much of this \""nicer\"" but the questions still need to be asked."
AL CARDINAL Investments,0,"The pope fired the head of his security detail and called in a mafia prosecutor to get to the bottom of secret London apartments, and what happened to money in his charity fund.\n\nROME-A few hours before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with his Vatican counterpart Pietro Parolin in Rome in early October, the Swiss Guard gendarmes raided a key office in Parolin's department.\n\nThey were acting on orders from \up high,\"" and cleaned out the offices of the Holy See's Financial Information Authority (AIF), which is essentially meant to be the watchdog agency set up to keep an eye out for any illicit activities at the Vatican Bank, which has been embroiled in dozens of scandals over the years. The gendarmes carted away computers, documents, and as many secret hard drives as they could find. Then they left and sealed the office.\n\nThe investigators were looking into what may seem like just the latest scandal within the Vatican's beleaguered financial system. But this time it touched Pope Francis personally with allegations that money meant for his beloved charities for the poor was actually going into pricey London property and seedy apartments alleged to be used for sinful activities.\n\nFive people, including AIF director Tommaso Di Ruzza, were banned from entering the Vatican's fortified walls while the investigation tied to the raid was carried out. A wanted poster -- featuring photos of the five people who worked in the office and meant for Swiss Guards' eyes only to know who not to let in -- was inevitably leaked to the press.\n\nPope Francis, to put it mildly, was pissed off that the wanted poster was leaked and the reputations of those on it -- who may not be guilty of anything -- sullied. A Vatican statement condemned the outing of those on the wanted poster as \""prejudicial to the dignity of the people involved.\"" The pope turned to his security chief Domenico Giani to find out exactly who leaked the photo. On Monday, his detective work still fruitless, Giani resigned.\n\nIn his official letter of explanation, he blamed his inability to smoke out whoever leaked the photos. \""I felt shame for what happened and for the suffering of these people,\"" he wrote, according to the letter sent to Vatican accredited journalists. \""Having always said I was ready to sacrifice my life to defend the Pope's, in the same spirit I made the decision to resign.\""\n\nMany now wonder if there is more to Giani's resignation, just as details of the AIF raid are starting to sound something like the explosive scandal in the 1980s tied to American Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, mobsters, Masons, and murder. That scandal is also loosely related to the disappearance of Italian teen Emanuela Orlandi, who some believe was tasked with delivering a message from Marcinkus to someone he was collaborating with or to Orlandi's father -- it has never been clear -- and then killed to stop her from testifying. In the Marcinkus scandal, Roberto Calvi, the head of Italy's largest private bank before it collapsed, which was tied to Marcinkus' crafty accounting, ended up hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London with a pocket full of bricks and cash in various currencies.\n\nThis latest scandal also leads to the U.K., but so far at least, no one has been killed. The Italian newsmagazine L'Espresso uncovered a trail that leads to a former warehouse for Harrods on Sloane Ave. in London, which the Vatican controls through British Grolux Investments Ltd. -- which records show is run by the Vatican's Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See (APSA). Apparently, around $400 million that was earmarked for the pope's charity fundraiser Peter's Pence -- named for Peter, the Catholic Church's original pope tapped by Jesus -- went to pay off the mortgage of private apartments in the warehouse.\n\nInvestigative documents unearthed by L'Espresso say the property now houses about 100 apartments, some of which are frequented by priests and other clergy as a sort of lurid London getaway. There have been reports in the Italian press of gay brothels where priests meet up with young men, and on rarer occasions, young women, as well as other unseemly activities taking place on the premises, but apart from going door-to-door, it is impossible to verify. Rome is filled with gay saunas frequented by priests that operate in the shadow of St. Peter's Basilica, so it would surprise few if the clergy got up to the same thing when they traveled abroad.\n\nJust days after his gendarmes raided the AIF offices, Francis assigned anti-Mafia prosecutor Giuseppe Pignatone to head the Vatican court assigned to get to the bottom of the Vatican Bank's alleged charity theft. Previous wrongdoings have been investigated internally. Tapping an outsider like Pignatone marks a change in strategy and sends a clear message that the pontiff doesn't exactly trust the usual gatekeepers. Among Pignatone's many accomplishments in his storied career fighting organized crime is helping pull back the curtain on Rome's own mafia that involved a one-eyed gangster and 40 thieves. Whether the pope believes there is a link between the Roman mafia and the Vatican Bank has not been made clear. The first case Pignatone will preside over is the trial of Angelo Caloia, the former Vatican Bank president who is accused of embezzling millions off Vatican property deals.\n\nThe Vatican Bank, officially known as the Institute for Religious Works or IOR, has been sketchy for years. In 2013, the European Central Bank closed down its credit card capabilities, meaning everyone from tour groups slogging through the Vatican Museums to nuns trying to buy rosaries had to pay cash on Vatican property. In 2014, Francis created the first ever Secretariat for the Economy to try to unravel the mess. But the first head of that department was ENTITY George Pell, now appealing a child sex abuse conviction in Australia. Pell had announced the discovery of hundreds of millions of dollars that were not accounted for when he first took the job. He has not yet been replaced and doesn't look like he will return any time soon. It is little wonder that Francis has been left with no choice but to handle things first-hand if he ever hopes to clean up the Vatican's dirty money problems."
AL CARDINAL Investments,0,"VATICAN CITY (RNS) -- Pope Francis' \guardian angel\"" handed in his wings on Monday. Domenico Giani, the head of the Vatican police force, submitted his resignation amid the latest leaks and scandals surrounding the Catholic institution's finances.\n\n\""In order to assure the proper serenity to the ongoing investigation,\"" the statement Monday (Oct. 14) by the Vatican reads, \""and although the Commander bears no personal responsibility in the unfolding of the events, Domenico Giani has tendered his resignation to the Holy Father out of love for the Church and faithfulness to Peter's Successor.\""\n\nThe statement acknowledges that the perpetrator of the latest leak \""remains unknown,\"" even though it was distributed only among the Vatican police force, the Gendarmerie, and the Swiss Guards. The statement also says that Francis recognizes Giani's \""unquestionable faithfulness and loyalty,\"" which guaranteed \""a lasting atmosphere of ease and security around the Holy Father.\""\n\nAccording to local media outlets, the reason behind Giani's dismissal is due to the latest wave of leaks surrounding foreign investments by the Vatican Secretariat of State. A document obtained by Italian news magazine l'Espresso on Oct. 2 and signed by the former police head showed pictures of five Vatican employees barred from entering the Catholic city-state.\n\nThe pictures of the people in question, two of whom are employed in high-profile institutions in the Vatican (the Vatican anti-money laundering organization AIF and the Secretariat of State), resembled mugshots even though the document made no mention of the nature of the allegations against them.\n\nRELATED: Making sense of the Vatican's looming financial scandal\n\n\""An inquiry was launched by the Holy Father,\"" said Vatican spokesmen Matteo Bruni to local media this weekend, \""on the illicit distribution of a document intended for internal use by the security forces of the Holy See.\""\n\nBruni said that \""the gravity\"" of this leak is comparable, in the words of Pope Francis, \""to a mortal sin, because it is damaging to the dignity of the people and of the principle of presumption of innocence.\""\n\nRumors that Francis was looking to assign the head of the Vatican Gendarmerie to another position have been circulating for months. But a closer look at the 20-year tenure of the \""comandante\"" raises questions as to why he was allowed to continue in his position for so long.\n\nIn 1999, Giani became the deputy of Camillo Cibin, former Vatican police chief, and tackled a woman attempting to attack then-Pope Benedict XVI during Christmas celebrations in 2008 and again in 2009. Giani became inspector general of the Gendarmerie Corps in June 2006 and the personal bodyguard to Pope Francis and his predecessor.\n\nGiani has been a fixture at papal audiences and apostolic visits for two decades, a time that included some of the most perilous moments in the Catholic Church. The Vatileaks scandals in 2012 and 2015 shed light on the administration of Vatican finances by the Institute for Religious Works, also known as the Vatican bank. Both these scandals occurred during Giani's tenure and he led the investigations on the cases.\n\nIn an interview in Italian released on l'Osservatore Romano on Monday, Giani said he recognized that the recent release of the document \""certainly trampled on the dignity\"" of the people concerned and that he himself \""felt shame for what happened.\""\n\n\""I tried to carry it out with self-denial and professionalism but feeling serenely like a 'useless servant' who has done his little part to the end,\"" he told the Vatican media.\n\n\""For this reason, having always said and testified my readiness to sacrifice my life to defend that of the pope, with this same spirit I have made the decision to hand in my resignation so as not to damage in anyway the image and activity of the Holy Father,\"" he said.\n\nGiani oversaw numerous reform efforts by three popes to bring order, transparency and accountability into the Vatican finances. He also coordinated the Vatican Fire Department and was a member of the Financial Security Committee created by Pope Francis in 2013 to prevent money laundering, the financing of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nGiani's role in promoting Francis' financial reform was put into question in 2017, when the then-auditor general at the Vatican, layman Libero Milone, was forced to resign after being charged with alleged double-dipping on expenses amounting to $33,000 and espionage. All charges against Milone were dropped, but the former financial inspector claimed in interviews that Giani forced him to resign under duress.\n\nThe former police head, who has a background in the Italian secret service, was also embroiled in a 2013 scandal surrounding the arrest on money laundering charges of Italian Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, former auditor at the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See, the Vatican's financial powerhouse that controls both its investment portfolio and its real estate holdings.\n\nMedia outlets also questioned the funding of Giani's expensive work on his apartment near the Vatican as confirmed by several Italian news outlets and sources near the Vatican. The complex profile that emerges is hard to place within Pope Francis' often-stalled financial reform efforts.\n\nThere has been no announcement as to what position Giani will continue to occupy within the Vatican, if any, and in the context of reports of a looming financial scandal in the Vatican -- a possible new Vatileaks -- there are questions of whether the commander's resignation will be the last one we'll see in the coming months.\n\n\""Unfortunately, within the Vatican, the sense of loyalty and fealty to the institutions is falling short,\"" said Italian ENTITY Angelo Becciu, former deputy secretary of state who was tapped to head the Vatican Congregation for Saints' Causes by Pope Francis, in a recent interview with Italian TV network Mediaset.\n\nBecciu's name has been linked to investments of Vatican finances in London real estate and in his remarks he spoke of the necessity of \""receiving the pope's appeal to be a united community."

OFAC is also designating five companies determined to be owned or controlled by ENTITY, and one company owned or controlled by Ajing. OFAC designated these individuals and entities pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13818, which builds upon and implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and targets perpetrators of serious human rights abuse and corruption.\n\n'These South Sudanese elites and corrupt government officials have drained state coffers and usurped the country's resources with impunity. ENTITY and Ajing leverage their businesses and political connections to engage in corruption at great expense to the South Sudanese people,' said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. 'The South Sudanese government must take urgent measures to increase transparency and enforce accountability against those involved in systemic corruption. Privileged elites should not be allowed to profit from conflict as they undermine efforts to bring lasting peace to South Sudan.'\n\nAs a result of today's action, all property and interests in property of the individuals and entities named below, and of any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by them, individually, or with other designated persons, that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons, are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC or otherwise exempt, OFAC's regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. In addition, any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a U.S. person, wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited by E.O. 13818 if performed by a U.S. person or within the United States would be prohibited.\n\nASHRAF SEED AHMED ENTITY\n\nSudanese businessman ENTITY has been used by a senior South Sudanese government official as an intermediary to deposit and hold a large amount of funds in a country outside of South Sudan. Following OFAC's designation of Benjamin Bol Mel in December 2017, the senior South Sudanese official began to use a bank account in the name of one of ENTITY's companies to store his personal funds in an attempt to avoid the effects of potential sanctions designations. Further, in early 2019, the South Sudanese government made millions of dollars in payments to a company owned by ENTITY; while the official reason was for the payment for food, the money instead went to senior South Sudanese government officials. Other South Sudanese government officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the massive corruption in the South Sudanese government, noting that although large amounts of money were paid to ENTITY for supplies and provisions, government forces never seemed to be adequately supplied.\n\nSeparately, a company partially owned by ENTITY has been publicly implicated in the importation of amphibious armored vehicles into South Sudan that gave the Government of South Sudan the ability to extend offensives that included violent attacks on innocent civilians.\n\nFive companies owned or controlled by ENTITY were also designated today: ENTITY General Trading Limited, ENTITY General Trading LLC, ENTITY, ENTITY Petroleum Company limited, and NILETEL.\n\nENTITY is being designated for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery.\n\nKUR AJING ATER\n\nAjing is a South Sudanese businessman who has bribed key officials in the Government of South Sudan in order to maintain influence and access to the South Sudanese oil market. Ajing used these bribes to both curry favor with a senior gatekeeper within the Government of South Sudan and to ensure the silence and compliance of a key government officials. In late 2018, the South Sudanese government made a large cash payment to Ajing. While the official reason was for the payment of food, the money instead went directly to a senior South Sudanese government official. In addition, Ajing has been obligated large amounts of oil by the Government of South Sudan, and has given money and vehicles to government officials in return.

AL CARDINAL Investments,0,"VATICAN CITY (RNS) -- Last week, the Vatican released a mysterious statement acknowledging a raid by Vatican police on the offices of its Secretariat of State and of its financial watchdog agency, saying it was carried out by judicial order by the Vatican tribunal and with permission from unspecified \""superiors.\""\n\nThe Secretariat of State is the most powerful department in the Vatican bureaucracy. The Financial Information Authority, or AIF, was created in 2010 by then-Pope Benedict XVI to combat money laundering following the Vatileaks banking scandal.\n\nThe communique stated that Vatican police \""acquired documents and electronic devices\"" in the raid, presumably having to do with the secretariat's financial dealings, following charges presented last summer by the Institute for Religious Works, commonly known as the Vatican bank, and the office of the Revisor General, which is responsible for investigating corruption.\n\nThe Vatican has never publicly mentioned the charges, however, and last week's brief statement didn't explain the reason for the raid. Requests for clarification to the Vatican Press Office went unanswered.\n\nThe raid seems to be the latest shoe to drop in the Catholic Church's ongoing attempt to reform the Vatican's financial arm, an effort that has suffered setbacks of late. The three departments Francis created to champion the reform, the Secretariat for the Economy, the office of the Auditor General and the Council for the Economy, have been decapitated or have shown themselves to be ineffective.\n\nIn 2014, Francis named Australian ENTITY George Pell prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, who set about cleaning up the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See, the financial center at the Vatican. But a year later, Pell became embroiled in charges of sexual abuse of two choristers in Australia; he is currently serving a six-year prison sentence. No substitute has been appointed by Francis to take his place.\n\nLibero Milone, selected by Francis to be the first auditor general, was unceremoniously kicked out of the Vatican in 2017 by the gendarmerie before he was able to finish his work for alleged double-dipping on expenses amounting to $33,000. All charges against him have since been dropped, and Milone, who had accused a former papal chief of staff, now ENTITY Giovanni Angelo Becciu, of financial malfeasance, has said his ouster was politically motivated.\n\nMeanwhile, little has been heard from the Council for the Economy, as its head, ENTITY Reinhard Marx, grapples with tensions with the bishops in his native Germany. On Sept. 20, the council had an extraordinary meeting with representatives from various Vatican departments, allegedly for the purpose of reining in the Vatican budget deficit of over $76 million, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nFrancis hasn't given up. Last week, two days after the raid, he named a former lawyer for the city of Rome, Giuseppe Pignatone, as president of the Vatican tribunal.\n\nPignatone is well known for his commitment to fighting syndicated crime in the Italian capital, a choice that has led some local media to suspect that the financial scandal has taken a complex turn.\n\nIf last week's one-paragraph explanation of the raid only seemed to invited speculation, the Roman media's rumor machine was happy to oblige. Journalists clamored to reach their sources and paced the halls seeking clerics and laypeople to explain this new Vatican riddle.\n\nItalian daily \""L'Espresso\"" got there first. On Wednesday (Oct. 3) the paper published an image of a document issued by the head of the Vatican police, Domenico Giani, showing pictures of five people, four lay and one religious, all of whom were said to be \""cautiously suspended from service.\"" It is not clear why the Vatican did not share the document with the press, as it was handed out widely to Vatican employees.\n\nIn the Oct. 3 article, L'Espresso's Vatican reporter, Emiliano Fittipaldi, explained that the current scandal revolves around investments made by Becciu and Monsignor Alberto Perlasca, who oversaw the secretariat's financial investments until he was abruptly removed by Francis this summer.\n\nStarting in 2011, according to Fittipaldi, the two prelates made investments with two Luxembourg-based companies using money that may have been derived from donations by the faithful. The investments are said to concern a real estate property in London.\n\nPerlasca's name appears in the document published in L'Espresso, as does that of Monsignor Mauro Carlino, who oversees the Office of Information and Documentation of the Vatican Secretariat of State. His position was previously held by Carlo Maria Polvani, nephew of the papal accuser and former Vatican representative to the United States, Carlo Maria Viganò.\n\nAlso named were Tommaso Di Ruzza, second in command to Financial Information Authority President René Brülhart, Vincenzo Mauriello, of the Secretariat of State's protocol department, and Fabrizio Tirabassi, who oversaw the Secretariat of State's financial investments after Perlasca's departure.\n\nFinally, there was Caterina Sansone, an administrative assistant at the Secretariat of State who answered to Tirabassi.\n\nAll of them are barred from entering the Vatican, with the exception of Carlino, who resides in the Domus Sanctae Martae, a hotel that is also the pope's current residence.\n\nBut what these people are accused of -- if anything -- is still unknown, and speculation in the Italian press has shed no light on how any alleged misdeeds are related to their higher ups, if at all. One story this week had Becciu being told by Pope Francis that he is no longer allowed to leave the Vatican.\n\n\""How funny!\"" the veteran ENTITY tweeted in answer. \""Just yesterday the pope wished me safe travels for the flight that tomorrow will take me to Brazil!\"""
AL CARDINAL Investments,0,"VATICAN CITY -- A police raid on offices in the Vatican Secretariat of State, the suspension of five Vatican officials, and the appointment of a leading Italian anti-mafia magistrate as head of the Vatican's criminal tribunal have sparked intense speculation about the extent of financial corruption in the Holy See.\n\nVatican prosecutors seized documents, computers, telephones and passports and blocked bank accounts in Tuesday's raid on the administrative section of the Vatican Secretariat of State, the Church's central governing body.\n\nThe Vatican's Financial Information Authority (AIF), which is the Vatican's anti-money-laundering watchdog, was also raided.\n\nA Vatican statement on Tuesday said the promoter of justice of Vatican City Court, Gian Piero Milano, and Alessandro Diddi, adjunct promoter of justice, ordered the search after complaints in early summer from the Institute for Religious Works (IOR) -- commonly called the Vatican Bank -- and the Office of the Auditor General about financial transactions \carried out over time.\""\n\nAccording to Italian media reports, those transactions revolve around expensive property deals, primarily a 2013 multimillion-dollar real estate transaction in London's prestigious Mayfair district, which is said to have taken significant losses.\n\nThe documents seized on Tuesday reportedly relate to the years 2011 to 2018, the period when ENTITY Angelo Becciu, now the prefect for the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, was sostituto, the official responsible for the administrative affairs of the Secretariat of State.\n\nThe Italian magazine L'Espresso reported that Tuesday's action led to the suspension of five officials: Msgr. Mauro Carlino, head of documentation at the Secretariat of State, and four lay officials: Tommaso Di Ruzza, the director and No. 2 official at the AIF, Fabrizio Tirabassi, who manages financial investments in the Secretariat of State, and Vincenzo Mauriello and Caterina Sansone, administrators in the same dicastery. Di Ruzza did not respond to a Register request for comment.\n\nThe raid and suspension show the reforms begun by Benedict XVI and continued by Francis \""really work\"" and that new laws for Vatican City State \""are being applied,\"" the Vatican said in an unsigned editorial in L'Osservatore Romano, also published at the Vatican News website.\n\n\""The painful events made public this week are not a sign the system has failed,\"" it continued, \""but rather show the system has \""developed antibodies capable of reacting\"" and that the process of reforming Vatican finances is \""well underway.\""\n\nBut in the same editorial, the Vatican chastised the media for subjecting the five suspended officials to \""pillory,\"" as \""any possible responsibility on their part is still to be proven.\"" It said a Vatican investigation will determine how that information was leaked, but omitted to mention that the names were distributed internally to all Vatican staff.\n\nTuesday's events were also followed this week by the appointment on Thursday by Pope Francis of one of Italy's leading anti-mafia prosecutors as president of the Vatican's criminal tribunal.\n\nPignatone's reputation as a leading Italian chief prosecutor, who has handled major investigations into the Cosa Nostra and 'Ndrangheta organized crime gangs in Sicily and Calabria, points to the extent of the financial corruption needing investigation in the Vatican.\n\nHe replaces Giuseppe Dalla Torre, who oversaw two \""Vatileaks\"" trials, one involving the leaking of documents by Pope Benedict XVI's former butler and the second relating to a priest and lay official working in Vatican finances. Dalla Torre was also involved in the prosecution of the former president of the Bambino Gesu, the Vatican's children's hospital, that also has been embroiled in a web of corruption allegations, including assertions that the U.S.-based Papal Foundation was improperly induced to provide funds to bail out the troubled institution.\n\nThe Register was told that the main target of this week's raid was not primarily the five suspended officials, nor the current leadership in the Secretariat of State, but rather others who have since left the dicastery and whose past actions continue to be subject to scrutiny.\n\n\""This raid was not against the current sostituto, Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra, who is striving to perform a clean-up of the mess he has inherited in the general affairs section administrative offices, but, rather, his predecessor, ENTITY Becciu, and his administrative right-hand man, Msgr. Alberto Perlasca,\"" an informed source told the Register.\n\nIn 2009, then-secretary of state ENTITY Tarcisio Bertone appointed Msgr. Perlasca head of the administrative office of the Secretariat of State -- an influential position that included handling all financial transactions passing through the Secretariat of State. ENTITY Bertone appointed ENTITY Becciu as sostituto in 2011.\n\nPope Francis, well acquainted with Msgr. Perlasca since he served in the nunciature in Buenos Aires from 2006 to 2008, retained him as head of the administrative office until July this year, when he appointed him promoter of justice at the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, the Church's highest court.\n\nTirabassi was an assistant to Msgr. Perlasca, and Msgr. Carlino, who had only been in the post of head of documentation since July, was for many years the personal secretary of ENTITY Becciu.\n\nThe Register source said Archbishop Peña Parra has been making progress on putting the finances in order and that the suspension of Msgr. Carlino was to \""move him away\"" from the current sostituto, \""to distance him from highly confidential material.\""\n\nAlthough not directly and publicly accused of wrongdoing, ENTITY Becciu has been indirectly connected with the sudden dismissal in 2017 of the Vatican's first auditor general, Libero Milone.\n\nMilone maintained his innocence, telling the media at the time that \""a small group of powers\"" were trying to defame his reputation and that they were afraid of what financial accounts and other details he might show to the Pope and ENTITY Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state.\n\nENTITY Becciu said at the time that Milone \""went against all the rules and was spying on the private lives of his superiors and staff, including me.\"" Milone insisted it was the other way around, and last year the Vatican dropped all charges against him.\n\nThe Register asked ENTITY Becciu Oct. 4 if he wished to comment on this week's raid and whether he knew of the ill-advised London real estate deal at the center of the raid, but at the time of writing he was reportedly on his way to Brazil and has yet to reply.\n\nThe investigations into the Secretariat of State are reportedly connected with the prosecution of Angelo Caloja, a former Vatican Bank president accused of embezzlement.\n\nInternal sources also believe there are connections with financial misconduct reported in the Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See (APSA), the dicastery which handles the Vatican's real estate, several of which are in prime areas of London, and financial assets.\n\nIn July, the Register reported on a similar mishandling of London real estate investments by APSA, as well as cyphered accounts in Switzerland connected to the same dicastery.\n\nVatican investigations into these areas, notably by ENTITY George Pell, then prefect of the Secretary for the Economy, and Milone, led to a series of obstacles emerging, most significantly the abrupt ending in 2017 of the first external audit of the Vatican.\n\nA few months later, Milone was dismissed, and ENTITY Pell was forced to leave the Vatican to defend himself in Australia against clerical sex-abuse charges, which he vehemently denied."

In addition, Ajing has been obligated large amounts of oil by the Government of South Sudan, and has given money and vehicles to government officials in return. Ajing has claimed to have paid senior officials millions of dollars and has cooperated with the request of a senior official to route oil payments in cash rather than through official bank accounts. Further, Ajing was the recipient of a multi-year contract to purchase food for the South Sudanese military, and in return, paid a percentage of the contract back to a senior South Sudanese government official. According to public media reports, Ajing received millions of dollars in contracts for the South Sudanese military, including one contract that alone exceeds the total amount budgeted for the military's goods and services for the year by a factor of ten.\n\nAjing is being designated for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, an entity that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery. One company owned or controlled by Ajing was also designated today: Lou Trading and Investment Company Limited.\n\nGLOBAL MAGNITSKY\n\nBuilding upon the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, on December 20, 2017, the President signed E.O. 13818, in which the President found that the prevalence of human rights abuse and corruption which have their source, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States, had reached such scope and gravity that it threatens the stability of international political and economic systems. Human rights abuse and corruption undermine the values that form an essential foundation of stable, secure, and functioning societies; have devastating impacts on individuals; weaken democratic institutions; degrade the rule of law; perpetuate violent conflicts; facilitate the activities of dangerous persons; and undermine economic markets. The United States seeks to impose tangible and significant consequences on those who commit serious human rights abuse or engage in corruption, as well as to protect the financial system of the United States from abuse by these same persons.\n\nTo date, the Department of the Treasury has designated 122 individuals and entities under E.O. 13818. This figure is in addition to the numerous human rights or corruption related designations Treasury has issued under other various authorities. In total, since January of 2017, Treasury has taken action against more than 680 individuals and entities with links to human rights abuse or corruption.\n\nFor more information on the individuals and entities designated today, click here.\n\n####\n\nAttachments\n\nOriginal document Permalink\n\nDisclaimer\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury published this content on 11 October 2019 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

Hulusi Akar,1,"The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Oct. 14 imposed economic sanctions on Turkey's Ministry of National Defense and Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, as well as three senior government officials.\n\nThe financial sanctions came in response to President Trump's Oct. 11 executive order to punish the Turkish government after its recent military strikes in Syria.\n\nOFAC added the two Turkish ministries, along with ENTITY, minister of national defense; Suleyman Soylu, minister of interior; and Fatih Donmez, minister of energy, to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List.\n\nPlacement on the SDN List blocks any assets or investments that these two Turkish ministries and three government individuals may have in the U.S. and prevents U.S. persons or companies from conducting business.\n\nThe Treasury Department warned that U.S. and foreign entities or persons that engage in financial transactions with these listed entities risk being subject to sanctions themselves.\n\nTo minimize the sanctions' impact to Turkey's domestic energy sector, the Treasury Department said it issued three general licenses:\n\n\We are prepared to impose additional sanctions on government of Turkey officials and entities as necessary,\"" the Treasury Department said in a statement.\n\nThe Trump administration's sanctions, however, fall short of the legislation introduced on Oct. 9 by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., that seeks to impose wider and more severe economic sanctions against Turkey. The senators are preparing to push their legislation through Congress this week.\n\nThe Graham-Van Hollen Turkey Sanctions Bill would place immediate sanctions on numerous senior Turkish government officials, including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as well as prohibit all U.S. military business and transactions with Turkey and activate the 2017 Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) on Turkey.\n\nTurkey immediately took military action after President Trump on Oct. 9 signed an executive order to remove U.S. troops from Syria and added that the Kurds would be on their own to defend themselves.\n\n\""The idea that the [Trump] administration is now going to sanction Turkey to protect the Kurdish people rings totally hollow,\"" Van Hollen said in an Oct. 12 statement. \""I'm continuing to work on bipartisan legislation to immediately apply tough sanctions against Turkey until it ends its aggression and withdraws.\"""
John Grisham,0,"NEW ORLEANS -- Tulane University has announced plans for a major book festival to be held annually between Mardi Gras and Jazz Fest.\n\nThe first New Orleans Book Festival at Tulane University will be March 19-21.

Iran,0,"India: Robbers board LPG tanker at Kakinada Anchorage\n\n23 September\n\nFour robbers boarded an LPG tanker at Kakinada Anchorage using a hook attached to a rope at 2325 hrs local time. Alert crew noticed the robbers and raised the alarm. The robbers reportedly escaped on a boat with ship's stores after hearing the alarm. The incident was reported to local authorities.\n\nPGI Analysis: Robberies are intermittently reported at Kakinada Anchorage, particularly overnight when thieves take advantage of low visibility. Although some robbers are reported to be armed, instances of violence are rare, indicating thieves are predominantly armed for self-protection or intimidation.\n\nSouth East Asia\n\nIndonesia: Robbers board tanker berthed at Dermaga Kencana terminal\n\n19 September\n\nTwo robbers boarded a tanker berthed at Dermaga Kencana terminal, Balikpapan at about 0100 hrs local time. Alert crew noticed the robbers and raised the alarm. Upon hearing the alarm, the robbers escaped without stealing anything.\n\nMalaysia: Abu Sayyaf kidnap three Indonesian fishermen off Sabah\n\n23 September\n\nSeven assailants in two pump boats wearing camouflage uniforms and masks approached two fishing vessels at approximately 1200 hrs local time, around 6.3 nm north of Pulau Tambisan, Sabah. The assailants, armed with M16 rifles, an RPG launcher and pistols, boarded the fishing vessels, held the crew at gunpoint and took their phones and IDs. The assailants kidnapped three Indonesian crew members from a Malaysian fishing vessel and headed to Tawi-Tawi Islands. It is likely the assailants were part of the kidnap-for-ransom detachment of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG). Malaysian and Philippine authorities increased their maritime patrols and intensified their military operations in an effort to rescue the kidnapped crew members. The attack took place in broad daylight, which is rare in the area as most kidnappings occur at night.\n\nPhilippines: Suspected robber attempts to board tanker in Mabini Anchorage\n\n24 September\n\nDuty crew onboard an anchored product tanker noticed a person attempting to open the anchor hawse pipe cover at 0100 hrs local time in Mabini Anchorage. The crew raised the alarm and mustered. The incident was reported to the local agent. No further details were immediately available.\n\nPGI Analysis: Robbers often target transiting and anchored and berthed vessels across Southeast Asia. Most robberies are opportunistic, but assailants have previously used force to extract their demands. Coordinated patrols by Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore along with increased security on vessels have led to a decrease in piracy in recent years.\n\nAn unspecified number of pirates reportedly stormed two passenger boats off the Nigerian coast on Bonny waterway. The boats were reportedly moving towards Bonny Island, the base of Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas, when the attack occurred. No further details were immediately available. Pirates often kidnap crew for ransom off Nigeria's coast.\n\nPGI Analysis: Pirate attacks off Nigeria are common and can occur up to 150 nm off the coast, demonstrating pirates' extensive geographical range of operation. Pirates are often armed and violent and there is precedent for attackers to persist when under attack from armed security teams until they have been injured or killed.\n\nAlbania: Authorities seize 137 kg of cocaine at Durres port\n\n27 September\n\nAuthorities seized 137 kg of cocaine at Durres port from a ship travelling from Ecuador. The drugs were hidden in a container transporting fruit. Albania is an important transit route for cocaine and heroin destined for the rest of Europe.\n\nColombia: Authorities seize 1.5 tonnes of cocaine from sunken boat\n\n30 September\n\nAuthorities seized 1.5 tonnes of cocaine and arrested three people after investigating reports of a sinking boat off Tumaco, Narino department. Authorities reportedly arrived at the scene and found three drug smugglers holding packages of cocaine to remain afloat. Several other cocaine packages were found floating near the smugglers. Authorities said the smugglers intended to ship the narcotics to Central America but did not provide a precise location. Navy officers released information regarding the drug seizure on 30 September though the incident took place on a previous unreported date.\n\nCyprus: Port workers call off strike for 26 September\n\n26 September\n\nCyprus Port Authority workers at the ports of Limassol, Larnaca and Nicosia called off a nationwide strike scheduled for 26 September. The decision came after successful negotiations with the government on the implementation of a proposed national health insurance system.\n\nGreece: Coast officers exchange fire with drug-loaded speedboat\n\n25 September\n\nGreek border officers exchanged small arms fire with drug smugglers on a speedboat that attempted to enter Turkish waters. The smugglers were allegedly attempting to smuggle drugs into Turkey from Albania. The operation resulted in the arrest of two Albanian nationals and one Italian, local media reported. Armed Albanian drug smugglers regularly try to smuggle drugs using speedboats.\n\nKenya: Nairobi, Mogadishu agree to normalise relations\n\n25 September\n\nSomalia and Kenya agreed to normalise their relations after months of tension over a maritime border dispute. In talks mediated by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the two countries also agreed to improve ties between their governments. However, Mogadishu and Nairobi have yet to resolve the border dispute, which is currently before the International Court of Justice in the Hague.\n\nMorocco: Authorities seize 11 kg of cocaine at Tanger-Med\n\n20 September\n\nAuthorities seized 11 kg of cocaine aboard a cargo truck at the northern port of Tanger-Med. The truck had arrived from Spain. Two suspects, at least one of whom is a Moroccan national, were arrested in connection with the seizure. There has been an increase in cocaine seizures in Morocco in recent years, likely due to changes in trafficking routes from South America coupled with an increase in domestic consumption.\n\nMorocco: Migrant boat capsizes off Casablanca, killing at least seven\n\n29 September\n\nAuthorities recovered the bodies of seven Moroccan would-be migrants after their boat capsized en route to Spain. The bodies washed ashore in Ain Harrouda area near Casablanca. Three survivors were taken unconscious to hospital. It was not immediately clear how many migrants were on the boat originally. Migrant departures from Morocco towards Spain have increased since 2018, as other transit countries have stepped up anti-human trafficking measures.\n\nRussia: Authorities detain North Korean fish vessels, 262 crew for poaching\n\n27 September\n\nBorder guards detained three North Korean fishing vessels and 262 crew members for poaching in waters that Moscow considers its exclusive economic zone, according to local media. The crew and vessels were taken to the port of Nakhoda and border guards have seized 30,000 squid as well as fishing equipment. The countries have had several disputes over fishing in the region in the past.\n\nSouth Korea: Seoul fires warning shots towards North Korean boat near Yeonpyeong\n\n27 September\n\nThe military fired 10 rounds of machine gun fire towards a North Korean boat that crossed the sea border with South Korea, before sending a navy mechanic to repair the drifting boat's engine so it could return home, according to officials. The wooden boat with four crew members returned to North Korea, hours after it had entered South Korean waters near the western border island of Yeonpyeong. Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it was the first time South Korea had fired warning shots towards a North Korean vessel since President Moon Jae-in took office in 2017.\n\nUAE: British tanker arrives in Dubai after detention in ENTITY\n\n28 September\n\nA British-flagged tanker that was detained by ENTITY for 10 weeks arrived in Dubai's Port Rashid, Reuters reported. The Stena Impero oil tanker had set sail from the Bandar Abbas port on 27 September. ENTITY seized the Stena Impero in July following the seizure of an ENTITYian oil tanker off Gibraltar.\n\nUnited States: Coast Guard seizes five tonnes of cocaine from submarine in the Pacific Ocean\n\n24 September\n\nThe US Coast Guard seized more than five tonnes of cocaine from a submarine at an undisclosed location in international waters in the west Pacific Ocean. The seizure took place on 5 September, but authorities only released information regarding the incident on 24 September. The origin of the narcotics was unclear. South American drug gangs have used submarines to transport narcotics into the US for several years.\n\nSource: Protection Vessels International"
Iran,1,"Following the brutal killing of Saudi dissident and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, one year ago, the Saudi government became something of a toxic commodity in American politics. Several high-profile lobbying and public relations firms dropped the Saudis as a client. Think tanks, including the Brookings Institution, severed ties with the Saudi government. Businesses pulled out of a major conference in Riyadh shortly after Khashoggi's death.\n\nAs the U.S. intelligence community, and the United Nations, were determining that Saudi Arabia was culpable in the killing, members of Congress demanded accountability. Democrats led the charge on a series of bills that would have halted U.S. arms sales to the kingdom and ended U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition's disastrous war in Yemen. Republicans were outraged too. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who claimed on \Fox & Friends\"" to have once been Saudi Arabia's \""biggest defender on the floor of the United States Senate,\"" announced shortly after Khashoggi's death that Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, \""has got to go.\"" The crown prince denies a role in Khashoggi's death; the U.N. sees credible evidence warranting further investigation.\n\nDespite the backlash directed at the kingdom, the Saudis haven't faced serious consequences for the slaying of Khashoggi or its slaughter of civilians in Yemen. That is thanks in large part to one man -- President Trump. He has loudly and emphatically defended Saudi Arabia at every opportunity. According to a July House Oversight committee report, he recently considered giving Riyadh nuclear technology without appropriate safeguards to prevent nuclear proliferation, in part at the behest of the chair of his inaugural committee, Thomas J. Barrack Jr. He has also tweeted at least a fleeting willingness to go to war with ENTITY on Saudi Arabia's behalf following the attacks on Saudi oil fields, something the American public overwhelmingly doesn't support.\n\nTrump's principal argument for siding with the Saudis has to do with the alleged economic benefits of U.S. arms sales to the kingdom. It all began during his May 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia, when he touted a purported $110-billion arms deal that would mean \""jobs, jobs, jobs\"" for Americans. The deal itself, according to the Washington Post \""Fact Checker,\"" was considerably smaller than the administration claimed, with much of it composed of sales already approved under the Obama administration or speculative offers that would happen years from now, if ever. And a report from our organization, the Center for International Policy, found the president's claims of U.S. jobs tied to Saudi arms deals were greatly exaggerated -- 10 to 20 times the actual number.\n\nThe facts, however, have not prevented Trump from vetoing a series of congressional measures aimed at ending U.S. military support and arms sales to the region.\n\nWhile Trump appears to be the commander-in-chief of Saudi Arabia's public relations efforts in the U.S., he's far from alone. Even with several firms abandoning the influence machine the Saudi's had assembled before Khashoggi's killing, the Saudi lobby is still represented in the U.S. by more than 20 \""K Street\"" firms, according to the Department of Justice . This includes influential operators such as Squire Patton Boggs and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck -- whom the Saudis paid over $1 million on Oct. 4, 2018, just two days after Khashoggi was killed at the Saudi consulate -- and the McKeon Group, whose namesake, former Rep. Howard \""Buck\"" McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), was once the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also dramatically increased funding to many of the lobbying and public relations firms that stayed with them post-Khashoggi. In fact, one firm -- Qorvis Communications, the Saudis' longtime public relations gurus in America -- received nearly $18 million from the kingdom in just the first three months after Khashoggi's death, more than most countries spend on all of their lobbying activities for an entire year. Washington lobbyists acting as agents of Saudi Arabia have also continued to give lavishly to House and Senate campaigns, in some cases on the same day they met with members of Congress or their staffs to discuss the kingdom.\n\nAll of this has served a critical function for the Saudi regime: maintaining enough support in Congress to ensure Trump's vetoes aren't overridden, which keeps the U.S. government from punishing the Saudis for Khashoggi's death.\n\nPresident Trump's protection of Saudi Arabia is at best a temporary shield. Veterans, peace and human rights groups, and other interest groups have been pushing Congress to block U.S. military support for the kingdom by invoking provisions of the War Powers Resolution and making amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act. Human rights organizations also have pushed beneficiaries of Mohammed bin Salman's private charity -- among them the New York Public Library and the United Nations -- to abandon their connection to the foundation, which the crown prince uses as a propaganda platform.\n\nYet, one year after Khashoggi's killing, and 4 ½ years into the brutal Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, Congress and the president have yet to hold Saudi Arabia accountable. That cannot be allowed to stand. On the anniversary of Khashoggi's murder, we owe it to him to stand up to the Saudi lobby and the president, and once and for all punish the Saudi government for what it has done."
Iran,1,"North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile on Wednesday - possibly from a submarine - just days ahead of the expected resumption of nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea after a seven-month hiatus.\n\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff says the missile was fired from waters off the peninsula's east coast near the port city of Wonsan, and traveled about 280 miles to the east before landing in the Sea of Japan.\n\nSouth Korea's National Security Council standing committee held a meeting after the test and voiced its \strong concern.\""\n\nThis would appear to be the most powerful weapon North Korea has tested since a February summit in Vietnam between President Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un. That meeting ended without a denuclearization agreement.\n\nThe test came just hours after North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui was quoted by state media as saying that working-level denuclearization talks would begin with a day of preparatory meetings on Friday, before getting underway on Saturday. Choe did not mention a possible venue for the talks.\n\nWhile Trump has downplayed Pyongyang's series of missile and rocket launches since then, today's test prompted speculation that talks could be delayed.\n\nNorth Korea has issued an ultimatum, threatening to abandon negotiations for good if the U.S. does not show a more flexible strategy and come to the table with concessions by year's end.\n\nTrump has indicated he is willing to adopt a \""new method\"" in talks, and last month fired his national security adviser John Bolton, the administration's chief opponent of partial denuclearization deals with both North Korea and ENTITY.\n\nThe projectile fired today is believed to belong to North Korea's Pukkuksong or North Star class of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), believed first tested with solid fuel in August, 2016.\n\nSouth Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo told a parliamentary committee that the Pukkuksong class is capable of flying distances up to around 910 miles, but this time the missile was launched in a 565-mile high arc, shortening its horizontal trajectory.\n\nSolid-fuel SLBMs can be launched more quickly than liquid-fueled missiles and the underwater launch platform makes them harder to detect and target. North Korea is not known to be able to launch them from a submarine yet, but has used submersible barges for tests.\n\nThe Pukkuksong class of missiles is intended to be capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.\n\nJapanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said a missile fell into Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone, off the western prefecture of Shimane.\n\nJapan's Kyodo News Agency quotes Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as saying: \""Such a ballistic missile launch is in breach of U.N. Security Council resolutions and we strongly protest and condemn it.\""\n\nHighlighting internal divisions plaguing the U.S. sponsored system of military alliances in Asia, Kyodo reports that South Korea requested intelligence from Japan about the launch through an intelligence-sharing pact which Seoul is quitting, amid a trade war.\n\nIn Italy, a State Dept. spokeswoman traveling with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, \""We call on the DPRK [North Korea] to refrain from provocations, abide by their obligations under U.N. Security Council resolutions, and remain engaged in substantive and sustained negotiations to do their part to ensure peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and achieve denuclearization.\""\n\nA potent bargaining chip for the North\n\nSince May, Kim Jong Un's public appearances, in which he typically gives instructions or \""field guidance\"" to his subordinates, have largely focused on North Korea's military capabilities and weapons production.\n\nHe has personally overseen several missile launches. Kim appeared to give a boost to his country's SLBM program in July when he visited a new submarine being built at a shipyard. He has also promoted officials in charge of military industries to the top of the North Korean political hierarchy.\n\nAnalysts believe that these visits indicate Kim's distress at returning from Hanoi in February without a deal, when he believed one was in reach. They're also thought to show his ambivalence about a future agreement, and his determination to deal with the U.S. and South Korea from a position of strength.\n\nStronger military capabilities could strengthen Pyongyang's hand in negotiations with the U.S. by constituting a threat held in reserve, or an asset to be bargained away, for the right price.\n\nNorth Korea's missile launch \""also appears to take into consideration multiple factors, including our military's demonstration of its latest military assets yesterday,\"" Defense Minister Jeong Kyong-doo told lawmakers.\n\nYesterday was South Korea's Armed Forces Day, and it put on display for the first time several F-35 fighter jets recently acquired from the U.S.\n\nThe F-35s represent a conundrum for U.S. allies in Asia. Their purchase helps to mollify the Trump administration, which wants South Korea and Japan to contribute more to their defense costs. But it infuriates North Korea, which is working to develop missiles to counter the F-35s and the bases from which they fly."
Iran,1,"The Trump administration has not grasped there is a global race to dominate the clean energy industry.\n\nThe United States has a unique geopolitical position and a global energy system based on an accelerated transition to renewables could either compromise or strengthen the nation, depending on its choices.\n\nIn another installment in our series of renewable energy and geopolitics interviews, Indra Overland - head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute for International Affairs - explained, as other countries become energy more self-sufficient or rely on imports from near neighbors, they will have less dependence on international oil and gas trade security guarantees provided by the U.S.\n\nIf the States jettisons fossil fuels, said Overland, it will lose a major geopolitical advantage. \People tend to forget that the United States is a very major fossil fuels producer in its own right,\"" said the analyst. \""The main chance for the United States to retain its global dominance in the energy sector would be through maintaining its lead on innovation and intellectual property related to clean energy technologies.\""\n\nOverland believes the U.S. is not maximizing its advantage in that area despite the strength of American universities, innovation and venture capital.\n\nThe turn away from clean energy\n\nThe Trump administration has reduced support for renewables for various reasons, according to Overland. \""The oil lobby at the business level has deep historical roots and is immensely strong in the United States,\"" he said. \""In addition, regions with oil, gas or coal extraction have large groups of working class people who feel threatened by [the] energy transition.\""\n\nThe nation also has a unique dependence on the car, Overland pointed out, however there are strong arguments in favor of clean energy in the United States.\n\nThe American political system hands outright power to one side or the other and Trump and the Republican Party have their hands on the wheel at present, despite receiving less than half the votes cast in the 2016 election. \""That may change in the future and there may also be change internally among the Republicans, many of whose young voters are becoming more preoccupied with climate change,\"" said Overland.\n\nThe professor described Trump's attitude to renewables as more negative than ambiguous. \""But on the other hand I think that attitude is not very deep felt,\"" he added, explaining the president and his party have to engage with interest groups who may be persuaded to come onside. The academic gave the example of the divisive issue of abortion, claiming many of the most strident anti-abortion voices in the Republican Party may simply be playing politics. \""They do this because there are large voter groups - including many Catholic women whom they otherwise would have little chance to attract - whom they hope to win over this way,\"" he said.\n\nIf young voters are concerned about climate change, suggested Overland, Republican Party attitudes could change on the issue.\n\nDependence on the Middle East\n\nLess dependence on fossil fuels would mean less dependence on oil imports from the Middle East but the region would remain strategically important to the U.S., particularly Egypt and the Suez Canal.\n\nIsrael would remain an important ally, said Overland, adding: \""Logically, apart from those two points, U.S. interest in the Middle East should decline, as it would have much less interest in propping up Saudi Arabia, influencing Iraq or invading ENTITY if the oil is no longer needed. However, one's answer to this question depends on how one interprets the world today. Many people believe that the United States invaded Iraq to get control over oil. However, what in practice ensued was that the invasion of Iraq destabilized the region and removed oil from the world market, sending oil prices sky high.\"" The academic pointed out the period after the invasion of Iraq saw some of the biggest profits ever banked by companies in history - accrued by American oil companies.\n\n\""Did the U.S. really invade Iraq to get hold of oil, or to get rid of it? Is it sanctioning and threatening ENTITY to protect Israel or to keep ENTITYian oil off international markets and keep oil prices high? Does the United States really care about democracy and human rights in the Middle East?\"" Overland asked.\n\nThe answers to those questions, Overland said, determine what sort of future relationship to anticipate between the U.S. and the Middle East. \""The motivations of states - which consist of millions of citizens and tens of thousands of organizations and interest groups - are hard to parse and the answers to such questions therefore remain elusive,\"" he said.\n\nTrade wars and solar\n\nAsked whether the tariffs applied to Chinese PV imports to the U.S. have a geopolitical context, Overland said the current American leadership does not understand there is a global race to gain preeminence in clean energy technology. \""I think they are not about promoting [the] U.S. PV industry but rather about the general trade war and about hobbling the development of the PV industry globally,\"" Overland stated. \""However, such actions often have unforeseen consequences and while the Chinese have made an incredible contribution to the development of the global PV sector, a slightly more globally balanced sector might be better in the long run.\n\nThe professor had previously told pv magazine: \""If Trump's trade war is not successful in either breaking down the Chinese or bringing them to heel, their dominance may be very long lasting. China has an immense discipline and vigor and now that it has rediscovered itself after the Maoist years it may keep going for a long time, also in solar power.\""\n\nNew international relations\n\nAs discussed in previous pv magazine interviews, more renewables may push nations towards energy self-sufficiency or greater integration with the energy markets of other countries. Overland believes the former more likely for the United States. \""In the case of Canada, Mexico and the U.S., I don't think transition to renewable energy and electrification necessarily will lead to more integrated transboundary electricity grids,\"" Overland said. While the small nations of Europe will have to cooperate to decarbonize, the U.S. could go it alone.\n\nOne thing is certain, Overland said, more renewables and a reduced need for oil and gas could be used as leverage against Russia and other petrostates. The rise of renewables will clearly weaken states such as Libya, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. On the other hand, the U.S. is also a major fossil fuel power, so it may lose some of its clout.\n\n\""The U.S. may still have supremacy but it would not be quite as important as today - though it would still be important for other reasons,\"" he concluded.\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n""""MUMBAI/DHAKA (Reuters) - From Kathmandu to Colombo, it's a kitchen nightmare: Onion prices have gone crazy.\n\nThat's because India, the world's biggest seller of the Asian diet staple, has banned exports after extended Monsoon downpours delayed harvests and supplies shriveled. And dedicated buyers across the region, like Nepalese housewife Seema Pokharel, are flummoxed.\n\n\""This is a terrible increase,\"" said Pokharel, out shopping for vegetables in Kathmandu. \""Onion prices have more than doubled in the last month alone.\""\n\nWhether it's Pakistani chicken curry, Bangladeshi biryani or Indian sambar, Asian consumers have developed a serious dependence on Indian onion supplies for go-to dishes. Shorter shipment times than from rival exporters like China or Egypt play a crucial role in preserving the taste of the perishable commodity.\n\nBut last Sunday New Delhi banned all exports from India after local prices jumped to 4,500 rupees ($63.30) per 100 kg, their highest in nearly six years, due to the delay in summer-sown crop arrivals triggered by longer, heavier rains than usual.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Onion prices at Lasalgaon market in Maharashtra - here)\n\nSince the ban, countries such as Bangladesh have turned to the likes of Myanmar, Egypt, Turkey and China to increase supplies in a bid bring prices down, government officials and traders said.\n\nBut the hefty volumes lost will be hard to replace.\n\nIndia exported 2.2 million tonnes of fresh onions in the 2018/19 fiscal year ended March 31, according to data from India's Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority. That's more than half of all imports by Asian countries, traders estimate.\n\nRising prices of alternative supplies will add to the headache for importers trying to get the vegetable from elsewhere, said Mohammad Idris, a trader based in Dhaka.

Iran,0,"From Kathmandu to Colombo, it's a kitchen nightmare: Onion prices have gone crazy.\n\nThat's because India, the world's biggest seller of the Asian diet staple, has banned exports after extended Monsoon downpours delayed harvests and supplies shrivelled. And dedicated buyers across the region, like Nepalese housewife Seema Pokharel, are flummoxed.\n\n\This is a terrible increase,\"" said Pokharel, out shopping for vegetables in Kathmandu. \""Onion prices have more than doubled in the last month alone.\""\n\nWhether it's Pakistani chicken curry, Bangladeshi biryani or Indian sambar, Asian consumers have developed a serious dependence on Indian onion supplies for go-to dishes. Shorter shipment times than from rival exporters like China or Egypt play a crucial role in preserving the taste of the perishable commodity.\n\nBut last Sunday New Delhi banned all exports from India after local prices jumped to 4,500 rupees ($63.30) per 100 kg, their highest in nearly six years, due to the delay in summer-sown crop arrivals triggered by longer, heavier rains than usual.\n\nSince the ban, countries such as Bangladesh have turned to the likes of Myanmar, Egypt, Turkey and China to increase supplies in a bid bring prices down, government officials and traders said.\n\nBut the hefty volumes lost will be hard to replace.\n\nIndia exported 2.2 million tonnes of fresh onions in the 2018/19 fiscal year ended March 31, according to data from India's Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority. That's more than half of all imports by Asian countries, traders estimate.\n\n'Taking Advantage'\n\nRising prices of alternative supplies will add to the headache for importers trying to get the vegetable from elsewhere, said Mohammad Idris, a trader based in Dhaka.

Central Bank Of Iran,1,"Nazanin Tabatabaee/WANAA man walks past the ENTITY, Tehran, Iran, Aug. 1, 2019.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Al-Monitor, the governor of Iran's ENTITY, Abdulnaser Hemmati, said he has been able to strengthen the Iranian rial by 40% since the onset of new US sanctions in 2018 that led to the currency's free fall.\n\nCommenting on INSTEX, a financial mechanism set up by Britain, France and Germany to facilitate Iranian trade in light of US sanctions, the ENTITY chief voiced his pessimism, stating, \I have come to the conclusion that the issue is not with INSTEX and its mechanism. The issue is that the Europeans seem to need US approval for their plans.\""\n\nAsked about the destiny of a $15 billion credit line proposal from the French, he answered that \""it depends on the Europeans and the United States to work it out.\""\n\nThe following is a transcript of Al-Monitor's interview with Hemmati, who was named as ENTITY governor in July 2018, coinciding with some of the worst days faced by the Iranian economy after the reimposition of US sanctions. It has been edited slightly for clarity.\n\nAl-Monitor: Following the re-imposition of US sanctions, Iran's rial plunged unprecedentedly, with one dollar currently being traded at about 20,000 rials. Some also attributed the rial's plunge to mismanagement. What role did sanctions play in the devaluation, and what can be attributed to mismanagement?\n\nHemmati: In my view, the exchange rate depreciation was mostly rooted in the expectations surrounding US sanctions. That being said, the restrictions imposed on the market during the unification of the [official and open-market] rates at 42,000 rials for one US dollar, which happened around the same time as the renewal of US unilateral sanctions and [Washington's] withdrawal from the JCPOA, also played a role. These two things, among other factors, led the exchange rate to depreciate. I can add to these factors the spillovers of sanction shocks, [US President Donald] Trump's relentless war of words about cutting Iran's oil exports to zero, and the US' unilateral attempts to cut off our banking system from the rest of the world. Added to all of this, a number of US-backed media outlets were actively running misleading reports about the future of Iran's economy, claiming that the exchange rate would free fall to 300,000 or 400,000 rials [to the dollar].\n\nOn the technical front, we had some issues too. We were lacking technical and software capabilities to monitor foreign exchange transactions for a period of time when the foreign exchange bureaus were shut down, and it took us almost two months to restore this key part of the market. We also lacked an integrated software system that would connect the banks and foreign exchange bureaus, preventing us from effectively monitoring the system and circumventing speculations. With the gradual weakening of the ENTITY supervision on [point of sale] terminals and banking transactions, everyone could transfer any amount using a debit card and a point of sale terminal, not only in Tehran but in Herat, Afghanistan; Sulaimaniyah, Iraq; Istanbul, Turkey; and Canada. This was unacceptable, and we mostly put an end to these practices.\n\nAl-Monitor: At the time of the currency's fall, there were some unofficial reports in Iran about the role of the United Arab Emirates in rial depreciation, as it was whispered in political circles that Abu Dhabi had closed down Iran's exchange stores. Do you think the UAE played a role in the rial's depreciation?\n\nHemmati: I also heard about these rumors. Some were also claiming that Saudi Arabia intervened in the foreign exchange markets in Sulaimaniyah and Herat. These were mere rumors, but the fact was that the UAE did, in fact, put restrictions on private Iranian foreign exchange bureaus as well as Iranian accounts in UAE banks. However, I have recently heard that some of those restrictions have been lifted, which is something that we, as neighbors, expect our neighbors to do.\n\nAl-Monitor: The rial's plunge and liquidity growth have sent inflation soaring. What steps are being taken to address this?\n\nHemmati: In the past few decades, the average growth of liquidity was around 20-23% [annually]. Therefore, the current liquidity growth of 23-24% is not a new issue. In my view, the key factor behind inflation was the exchange rate depreciation, which pushed up the prices of imported goods, including basic commodities and durable goods. Rising inflation continued until March 2019. Since then, we have seen that inflation is cooling off, which is evident in recent monthly inflation rates. Once we successfully curbed exchange rate depreciations, we were able to rein in inflationary pressures. As you well know, at the height of the recent sanctions, one US dollar was traded at around 20,000 rials. Today, it is about 11,400 rials, which translates into an almost 40% appreciation. We will continue to see further easing of inflation in the coming months. I must add that we are planning to apply a tool to manage liquidity, namely through open market operations. This is something that most ENTITYs do, and we will also use it to the full extent.\n\nAl-Monitor: Is there a gradual process in place to unify the black market and official exchange rates?\n\nHemmati: What you are talking about is the process to integrate the \""cash\"" market with the rest of the [foreign exchange] market. This is already underway and will soon be completed. Now, we have two regulated systems: the NIMA system, which covers bank drafts and large transactions, and the cash market, which will converge with the larger foreign exchange market.\n\nAl-Monitor: People on the street are complaining about the dire state of the economy, and many have been forced to leave Tehran to live in suburbs as a result of the current economic situation. Moreover, there are many people who have emigrated or transferred their money to other countries such as Turkey and Georgia. What is your opinion on this matter? What is the solution to remedy these problems?\n\nHemmati: We have always said that Trump's unlawful action to renew unilateral sanctions has severely affected the most vulnerable and the poor. Should these sanction pressures continue, the poor would be the most harmed. However, the government is attempting to help them through protective measures. With the decline in oil revenues, the government budget is under pressure, but the government is committed to protecting the most vulnerable segments of society.\n\nOn the issue of capital outflow, I must say that cheap foreign exchange was a form of subsidy for those who wanted to move their assets abroad. I understand that when the exchange rate was about 37,000 rials, some people purchased real estate in Canada and were able to cover their mortgage payments with their domestic deposit interests; this is not possible anymore. In fact, we used to offer subsidies to people who purchased real estate in the United States, Canada, Georgia and Turkey. The adjustment of the exchange rate helped decelerate the process substantially.\n\nAl-Monitor: Is the ENTITY worried about the collapse of some of the private banks in Iran? If yes, what are you doing to prevent such events?\n\nHemmati: We are not worried, but we are vigilant. We know that some banks have difficulties in their balance sheets, but we are monitoring them and providing support in case they need it. With the new powers granted to the ENTITY, the troubled banks and credit unions will be effectively supervised and managed. We have a long-term program for banking system reforms.\n\nAl-Monitor: Has this happened yet?\n\nHemmati: Yes, we have taken over three credit unions and started the reforms.\n\nAl-Monitor: A few banks belonging to the military organizations were recently merged. Were they also on the verge of collapse?\n\nHemmati: Some of those banks even had a positive performance, but they were merged following the order of the Supreme Leader that the armed forces must withdraw from the banking sector. The process is going well and will be completed in the near future.\n\nAl-Monitor: EU officials have repeatedly spoken about transactions being done based on INSTEX, the special purpose vehicle launched by the Europeans in January to facilitate non-USD transactions that won't break US sanctions. What is the current status of INSTEX and have any transactions been made through it?\n\nHemmati: To not give the Europeans any pretext [for stalling this process], we established a corresponding company, named a managing director and pledged its required capital, even sooner than the Europeans. Only after a long delay of four months, the Europeans were ready and a $4 million transaction was made through INSTEX, by which we purchased medical equipment for one of the provinces. After that, no transaction has been performed. The Europeans always claim that it should first begin the work by goods that are not subject to sanctions, but INSTEX was launched exactly to facilitate transactions of sanctioned goods. Therefore, I am not sure that INSTEX will be an extraordinary and special vehicle for Iran.\n\nAl-Monitor: Why were no transactions made after the first one?\n\nHemmati: Because they didn't deposit any money into INSTEX. We told the Europeans that they should establish a credit line based on a pre-purchase agreement or make an outright purchase of our oil. Nonetheless, it seems that the United States has not allowed them, and the Europeans claim that, still, the United States is not letting them do so. My feeling is that the Europeans lack determination to act independently.\n\nAl-Monitor: So you mean you are not optimistic about INSTEX?\n\nHemmati: I have come to the conclusion that the issue is not with INSTEX and its mechanism. The issue is that the Europeans seem to need US approval for their plans. They have failed to find any solution to this problem. That is why I see no point to remain optimistic.\n\nAl-Monitor: Is there any news about the French $15 billion credit line, or has it reached a dead end?\n\nHemmati: France has put so much effort into this, and we had told them that we would accept it on the condition that they pre-purchased our oil. We want to export our oil, and if they do not want to purchase our oil, then I do not see any use for this. I must also add that $15 billion is not much compared to what we have been able to provide to our importers, which has totaled $20 billion since early April 2019. They wanted to take a step and prove that they were able to buy oil within the JCPOA framework; but despite their efforts, it turned out that the United States has not allowed them yet.\n\nAl-Monitor: You mean that the French proposal is gone with the wind?\n\nHemmati: It depends on the Europeans and the United States to work it out. Throughout the negotiations, they were saying that they would go on if the United States approved it, and the United States declared that it would not agree with it.\n\nAl-Monitor: Is it true that even the French ENTITY was not willing to guarantee the credit line?\n\nHemmati: No, all the issues were discussed between the representatives of the Iranian ENTITY and French, German and British officials. However, they simply made everything subject to US approval.\n\nAl-Monitor: Is the door still open for negotiations to save the JCPOA?\n\nHemmati: The president of the Islamic Republic of Iran announced that if Iran were to negotiate with the United States within the framework of JCPOA and P5 + 1, the US sanctions should be lifted.\n\nAl-Monitor: On the issue of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which has extended Iran's deadline a few times, is it true that Russian and Chinese banks have warned Iran that they will not accept to have any financial transaction with Tehran if FATF puts Iran on the blacklist again?\n\nHemmati: Joining the FATF is one of the requirements of international banking transactions. So it is natural that all the banks would require compliance with FATF regulations."

Hizballah,1,"Brian H. Hook, Special Representative for Iran and Senior Policy Advisor to the Secretary of State\n\nChairman Risch, Ranking Member Menendez, distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify today, and thank you for devoting a hearing to discuss America's foreign policy to Iran.\n\nThis Administration has implemented an unprecedented pressure campaign with two primary objectives: First, to deprive the Iranian regime of the money it needs to support its destabilizing activities. Second, to bring Iran to the negotiating table to conclude a comprehensive deal, as outlined by Secretary Pompeo in May 2018.\n\nPresident Trump and Secretary Pompeo have expressed very clearly the United States' willingness to negotiate with Iran, and we are willing to meet with the Iranians without preconditions. No one should be uncertain about our desire for peace or our readiness to normalize relations should we reach a comprehensive deal. We have put the possibility of a much brighter future on the table for the Iranian people, and we mean it.\n\nThe comprehensive deal we seek with the Iranian regime should address four key areas: its nuclear program, its ballistic missile development and proliferation, its support to terrorist groups and proxies, and its arbitrary detention of U.S. citizens including Bob Levinson, Siamak Namazi, Xiyue Wang, and others.\n\nA year and a half ago, Secretary Pompeo laid out 12 points that expanded further on the kind of deal we are seeking with Iran. The requirements Secretary Pompeo laid out reflect the scope of Iran's malign behavior. It also reflects the longstanding global consensus as enshrined in multiple Security Council resolutions since Iran's nuclear violations were first addressed by the Council in 2006.\n\nBefore we exited the deal, re-imposed sanctions, and accelerated our pressure, Iran was increasing the scope of its malign activity. The Islamic Republic was strengthened by the resources and legitimacy provided by the nuclear deal. Under the deal, Iran was continuing to expand its missile testing and proliferation. We now have newly declassified information related to Iran's missile program that I can share today:\n\nBeyond continued advancements to its missile program, Iran was also deepening its engagement in regional conflicts.\n\nFurthermore, under the deal, Iran was given a clear pathway to import and export dangerous arms. Two days from now, on October 18th, we will be exactly one year away from the expiration of the UN arms embargo on Iran. Because of the Iran nuclear deal, countries like Russia and China will be able to sell conventional weapons to Iran. The Iranian regime will also be free to sell weapons to anyone. This will trigger a new arms race in the Middle East.\n\nThe moment Iran is allowed to buy advanced drones, missiles, tanks, and jets, it will do so. This will be a win for its proxies across the region, who will use such arms to then attack other nations on Iran's behalf. The United Nations Security Council needs to renew the arms embargo on Iran before it expires. We have made this a priority.\n\nUnder the Iran deal, the travel ban on 23 Iranian terrorists, including Qassem Soleimani, expires the same day as the arms embargo.\n\nConstraints on Iran will continue to unravel under the deal.\n\nOur Iran strategy is aimed at reversing these trends. Today, by nearly every measure, the regime and its proxies are weaker than when our pressure began and we are well on our way to restoring the strong international standards that had long guided the world's policy on Iran.\n\nShia militant groups in Syria have stated to the New York Times that Iran no longer has enough money to pay them as much as they have in the past. ENTITY and Hamas have enacted unprecedented austerity plans due to a lack of funding from Iran. In March, ENTITY's leader Hassan Nasrallah went on TV and said ENTITY needed public support to sustain its operations.\n\nWe are also making it harder for Iran to expand its own military capabilities. Beginning in 2014, Iran's military budget increased every year through to 2017, when it hit nearly $14 billion. However, from 2017 to 2018, when our pressure went into effect, we saw a reduction in military spending of nearly 10 percent. Iran's 2019 budget, which was released in March, called for even steeper cuts, including a 28 percent cut to their defense budget and a 17 percent cut for IRGC funding.\n\nThe IRGC's cyber command is now low on cash, and the IRGC has told Iraq's Shia militia groups that they should start looking for new sources of revenue. Now, because of our sanctions, Iran will be unable to even fully fund this skinny budget for 2019.\n\nIran's economy contracted by about 5 percent last year and this year will shrink by more than 10 percent. We estimate it could contract by as much as 14 percent, sending Iran into a deep depression. Iran is now tapping unconventional sources -- like privatizing state assets and drawing on its sovereign wealth fund -- to make up for the shortfall. Iran is being forced to choose between printing more money or delaying spending on infrastructure development, salaries, and benefits.\n\nIran has a choice: it can act like a country, or it can act like a cause. Iran must change its behavior and act like a normal nation or it will watch its economy crumble.\n\nOur policy is at its core an economic and diplomatic one. We are relying on economic pressure and the might of American diplomacy to raise the costs on Iran and force meaningful behavior change.\n\nIran, however, has responded to this policy with violence. In recent months, Iran has launched a series of attacks in a panicked bid to intimidate the world into halting our pressure. Iran was responsible for the attacks at the Port of Fujairah, the assault on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, and the attack on Saudi oil facilities at Abqaiq.\n\nIran should meet diplomacy with diplomacy, not with terror, bloodshed, and extortion. Our diplomacy does not entitle Iran to undertake violence against any nation or to threaten maritime security.\n\nThis Administration does not seek armed conflict with Iran. We have been equally clear to the regime that we will defend our citizens, forces, and interests, including against attacks by Iran or its proxies.\n\nWe stand with our partners and allies to safeguard global commerce and regional stability, and have taken appropriate steps to enhance the regional defense architecture. Our aim is to deter conflict and support our partners.\n\nThe Islamic Republic is also engaging in its longstanding practice of nuclear extortion. Iran's message to the international community is clear: if you do not allow us to conduct our normal level of terror, then we will behave even more badly until you do. It has long used its nuclear program in this way and for this reason. The world ought to recognize this extortion when it sees it.\n\nIran's recent accelerations of its uranium enrichment reminds us of the deficiencies of the Iran nuclear deal. Iran's nuclear threats are made possible by a plan that left Iran's nuclear capabilities largely intact and that seems to have encouraged Iran to dream of the day when key limits on its nuclear program would evaporate, allowing it to prepare for rapid breakout.\n\nI should also emphasize, Mr. Chairman, that the problems presented by Iran's provocative threats to begin building up its stocks of nuclear material - and the actions it is already taking to expand its uranium enrichment centrifuge research and development, and to produce more heavy water - are problems that the world would have faced anyway, in a few years' time, under the terms of the JCPOA itself.\n\nHad we stuck to the JCPOA until those dangerous Iranian provocations were actually permitted by the JCPOA, we would be less prepared to meet the threats Iran presents. In that intervening period, Iran would have continued on the trajectory it was on until the United States' re- imposition of sanctions pressures: amassing revenue from abroad because the deal encouraged business with Iran, while funneling maximum effort and money into missile development, missile proliferation, support for terrorism, and regional destabilization. The Iran we would have faced then would be much more formidable than the Iran we face today.\n\nWe must learn from past mistakes and demand comprehensive and permanent restrictions on Iran's activities in any new deal.\n\nWe can look to a recent tragedy to show nations can pressure Iran to change. When Sahar Khodayari, an Iranian woman, died from self- immolation after she was sentenced to prison simply for attending a soccer match in Tehran. Together with international outrage and condemnation, FIFA challenged the regime's policy of prohibiting women from attending matches. As a result of international pressure, Iran agreed to permit women to a match last week, even though the authorities kept the women segregated in a separate section.\n\nWhen the world comes together to push back against Iran, we see change in its behavior. This administration will do its part, and we are succeeding in having others join us. Late last month, France Germany, and the United Kingdom called for Iran to accept negotiations on its nuclear program, ballistic missiles, and regional activity. The E3 now agree with us that a new deal is needed. Secretary Pompeo and I have made clear to our allies and partners that we will continue to stand with them against Iran's violence.\n\nLooking forward, our pressure will continue to deny Iran access to the revenue streams it needs to destabilize the Middle East. As we raise the costs of Iran's expansionism and foreclose the possibility of prolonging the status quo, Iran will continue to find its violence will only earn it isolation and censure.\n\nWe seek a comprehensive deal that sets our two peoples on a new trajectory toward a far more peaceful and stable relationship. We remember that the longest suffering victims of the Iranian regime are the Iranian people. The last 40 years of Iran's history are a sad tale of corruption and the oppression of a once-vibrant people. The United States stands with the Iranian people in their deep desire that the next 40 years of Iran's history will not be stained by repression and fear of the clerics' cruelty. We wish nothing more for the Iranian people a future with by a truly representative government and friendship with the American people.\n\nChairman Risch, Ranking Member Menendez, and other Members of the Committee, I thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you. I welcome the opportunity to answer your questions."
Hizballah,1,"Faced with a bankrupt economy due to international sanctions over its illicit WMD and terrorist activities, Iran's regime faces a stark choice: Either it can stop wasting the nation's precious wealth on its regional aggressions or it can raise funds by increasing taxes and reducing services for an already impoverished nation. The regime has chosen the latter.\n\nThe mullahs' regional warmongering is coming at the cost of starvation and destitution for millions of Iranian citizens. But this is not a sustainable policy. Sooner or later, the nationwide protests over government corruption and overdue wages are bound to turn into an uprising for regime change.\n\nOn October 7, the regime's parliament held a session behind closed doors to discuss further decrease of subsidiaries on goods, particularly on fuel.\n\nOn October 8, the government announced a decrease of fuel rations from 30 liters to 20 liters for all citizens. Iranian society and Iran's economy are greatly dependent on fuel in order to function.\n\nFearing that sudden and complete removal of the state subsidiaries would result in an uprising, the regime is reducing them in stages. The regime has previously experienced huge protests over corruption and economic mismanagement.\n\nAlthough state subsidiaries are often meager sums, their reduction affects the lives of ordinary Iranians who count every single rial.\n\nAccording to the state-run Titr-e-Bartar news agency, the poverty line in Iran for a family of four persons is 80 million rials (around $500 US).\n\nDeputy Parliament Speaker Abdolreza Mesri on October 6 said: \Today, inflation is at 40%, and the poor have nothing to eat. Not a single rial has been added to the 1.6 million rial income of a family.\""\n\n\""Their income today is the same as last year: 1.6 million rials for a family of one and 5 million rials for a family of five, or 34,400 rials per day.\""\n\nMesri pointed out that the current cost of small-size bottled water is 15,000 rials. \""So with the income, we're giving people, they can drink one bottle in the morning, one at lunchtime and half a bottle at night.\""\n\n\""How can they cover housing, clothing, transportation, food, education, medical expenses and sanitation with 34,400 rials?\""\n\n\""And even that is being deprived of them. Where is all the money from the budget being spent?\""\n\nThe Iranian regime is aware that further pressure on the population could trigger a social uprising but since it is unwilling to stop wasting funds on regional wars and enriching the mullahs and Revolutionary Guards, it is forced to go down this path.\n\nRegime funds terrorism instead of resolving social-economic crises\n\nThe U.S. State Department in a report, \""OUTLAW REGIME: A CHRONICLE OF IRAN'S DESTRUCTIVE ACTIVITIES,\"" revealed that between 2012 and 2018 the regime ruling Iran has \""spent over $16 billion proppings up the Assad regime and supporting its other partners and proxies in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.\""\n\n\""Lebanese ENTITY is Iran's most powerful terrorist partner. In the past several years, it has demonstrated its far-reaching terrorist and military capabilities. Iran's annual financial backing to Lebanese ENTITY - a staggering $700 million per year - accounts for the overwhelming majority of the group's annual budget. Iran also provides up to $100 million annually in combined support to Palestinian terrorist groups, including Hamas, PIJ, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command,\"" the report added.\n\nWhile the regime uses the Iranian nation's wealth to pursue its terrorist agenda, the majority of Iranian people are living under the poverty line, and as the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) recently reported, the people are forced to sell their organs to cover their living expenses.\n\nAny incentive packages to the Iranian regime by European governments would only enable it to fund further terrorist attacks and enlarge its ballistic missile arsenal.\n\nIran's people, who are the primary victims of the regime, support international sanctions against their oppressors. They know that all money the regime receives from abroad is used to prolong its illegitimate rule. Since the U.S. reinstated sanctions on the regime last year, there has not been a single popular protest in Iran denouncing international sanctions. Instead, there have been thousands of protests, large and small, against the regime's corruption, economic mismanagement and suppression - many of which have ended with calls for regime change."
Hizballah,1,"It is note-worthy that Saab's nine-count indictment includes felonies under the Immigration and Nationality Act, for engaging in immigration fraud, including naturalization fraud in that he is alleged to have lied about his involvement with Hezbollah when he applied for naturalization and subsequently became a United States citizen.\n\nHe's a naturalized U.S. citizen admitted lawfully nearly 20 years ago\n\nBy: Michael Cutler\n\nA \sleeper\"" is an alien who, in one way or another, manages to enter the United States, either legally or illegally, and then maintains a low profile, hiding in plain sight until he/she is called into action to carry out terror attacks or support terror attacks in the United States.\n\nOften sleeper agents may also conduct surveillance, amass supplies or otherwise engage in preparatory functions for future deadly terror attacks.\n\nOn September 19, 2019 the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York issued a press release entitled, \""Manhattan U.S. Attorney Announces Indictment Of New Jersey Man For Terrorist Activities On Behalf Of ENTITY's Islamic Jihad Organization.\"" The subtitle of that press release provides more disturbing information. Alexei Saab Allegedly Was Trained by ENTITY's External Terrorist Operations Component in Bomb-Making and Conducted Intelligence-Gathering in New York City and Washington, D.C., and Elsewhere in Support of ENTITY's Attack-Planning Efforts.\n\nThe Department of Justice also issued a press release on September 19, 2019 about this case.\n\nIt is note-worthy that Saab's nine-count indictment includes felonies under the Immigration and Nationality Act, for engaging in immigration fraud, including naturalization fraud in that he is alleged to have lied about his involvement with Hezbollah when he applied for naturalization and subsequently became a United States citizen. Saab is also alleged to have entered into a fraud marriage for the purpose of providing another alien terrorist co-conspirator with U.S. citizenship in furtherance of their terrorist goals. U.S. citizenship provides the \""keys to the kingdom.\""\n\nThe official report, 9/11 and Terrorist Travel included these two excerpts about the clear nexus between immigration fraud and terrorism:\n\nOnce terrorists had entered the United States, their next challenge was to find a way to remain here. Their primary method was immigration fraud. For example, Yousef and Ajaj concocted bogus political asylum stories when they arrived in the United States. Mahmoud Abouhalima, involved in both the World Trade Center and landmarks plots, received temporary residence under the Seasonal Agricultural Workers (SAW) program, after falsely claiming that he picked beans in Florida.\n\n* * *\n\nTerrorists in the 1990s, as well as the September 11 hijackers, needed to find a way to stay in or embed themselves in the United States if their operational plans were to come to fruition. As already discussed, this could be accomplished legally by marrying an American citizen, achieving temporary worker status, or applying for asylum after entering. In many cases, the act of filing for an immigration benefit sufficed to permit the alien to remain in the country until the petition was adjudicated. Terrorists were free to conduct surveillance, coordinate operations, obtain and receive funding, go to school and learn English, make contacts in the United States, acquire necessary materials, and execute an attack.\n\nIn point of fact, several years ago I wrote an extensive article about the nexus between immigration fraud and terrorism. My article was entitled, Immigration Fraud: Lies That Kill-9/11 Commission identified immigration fraud as a key embedding tactic of terrorists.\n\nBefore we delve further into this case we must connect some very important dots. Today the United States is attempting to thwart Iran's efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. Iran is the world's most prolific and dangerous state sponsor of terrorism. Hezbollah is a terrorist organization that is funded and directed by Iran.\n\nAwhile back I wrote a commentary about a Congressional hearing that focused on the threats posed by sleeper cells to the United States. My piece, Congressional Hearing: Iranian Sleeper Cells Threaten U.S. provided information disclosed at the hearing and also included a link to The Washington Free Beacon report about the hearing under the unambiguous headline, Iranian-Backed 'Sleeper Cell' Militants Hibernating in U.S., Positioned for Attack.\n\nNow that we have put the case of the defendant in the case, Alexei Saab, a/k/a \""Ali Hassan Saab,\"" a/k/a \""Alex Saab,\"" a/k/a \""Rachid,\"" into proper context in terms of the broader issue of the national security / public safety threats posed by Hezbollah and other terrorist sleeper agents operating inside the United States, we need to go back and take a closer look at facts and allegation provided in the federal Criminal Complaint and Criminal Indictment as provided in the above-noted press releases.\n\nTo begin with, according to the allegations, Saab joined Hezbollah in 1996 and legally entered the United States nearly 20 years ago, in 2000. There was no mention as to the visa he used to enter the United States but it was disclosed that he applied for U.S. citizenship in 2005 and was subsequently naturalized in 2008.\n\nIn 2005 he traveled to Turkey to receive training in weapons, explosives and surveillance techniques and to be debriefed by his handlers about the results of his surveillance of potential terror targets in New York City, Washington, DC and elsewhere and that during one of his trips outside the United States he tried, unsuccessfully, at Hezbollah's direction, to kill a man they believed to be an Israeli intelligence agent.\n\nFor nearly 20 years this sleeper agent lived quietly among his neighbors in New Jersey. How-ever, his ultimate goal was to participate in a deadly terror attack to slaughter many victims.\n\nIf not for the work of the law enforcement officers who ultimately, through information provided by an informant, it is entirely possible that he would have gone on to carry out a deadly attack.\n\nSaab is only the latest of many alien sleepers who have been discovered and arrested.\n\nFor example, on June 8, 2017 the Department of Justice issued a press release, Two Men Arrested for Terrorist Activities on Behalf of ENTITY's Islamic Jihad Organization.\n\nHowever, how many more terrorists are still living among us, waiting for their instructions calling upon them to carry out deadly terror attacks?\n\nGlobalists and immigration anarchists vilify ICE agents and insist that it is unfair to arrest aliens who have no serious criminal histories.\n\nAs a rule, sleeper agents do not have criminal histories. This is a significant part of their methodology. It has been said that a good spy is someone who would not attract the attention of a waiter or waitress at a \""greasy spoon diner.\""\n\nThe same can be said of an effective sleeper agent. In point of fact, that waiter or waitress might well be a spy or a terrorist.\n\nThe threats are real, yet the leaders of the Democratic Party insist that we throw open our borders and stop enforcing our immigration laws. Sanctuary cities shield some truly dangerous aliens.\n\nThe second largest contingent of federal agents who are assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) are immigration law enforcement officers because, as we see in this case, alien terrorists invariably violate our immigration laws.\n\nThe best way of uncovering immigration fraud is not to pass more laws but to hire more agents who can conduct those vital investigations. Political leaders from both political parties have advocated a massive program to legalize unknown millions of illegal aliens in the United States.\n\nThere would be no way to interview those illegal aliens, let alone conduct field investigations. Such a program would irrevocably undermine national security and constitute an act of national suicide."
Hizballah,1,"Washington, DC (STL.News) - The US Department of State released the following statement:\n\n(Via interpreter) Good morning, and welcome to this joint press conference. We'll be having some brief statements by Minister Di Maio and followed by Secretary Pompeo, and then we'll be taking two questions from the Italian press and two from the U.S. press.\n\n(In English.) (Inaudible) brief statements, and then we'll take questions by two Italian journalists first, and then by two U.S. journalists. Minister Di Maio.\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER DI MAIO: (Via interpreter) Thank you, Giovanni. Thank you, everybody, for being here. A very warm welcome to Mr. Secretary of State Pompeo. Thank you very much for being here. Welcome to Villa Madama. Thank you for your visit, and thank you for having chosen to travel to Abruzzo following these institutional meetings. Thank you for deciding to go for the first time to the town your ancestors came from.\n\nI am very happy to have had this opportunity to meet. And as I reiterated to Secretary Pompeo, Italy is an ally of the United States. We are part of the Atlantic alliance, and we wish to be protagonists within the Atlantic alliance. We want to be protagonists within NATO. We want to be protagonists and stimulating our age-old alliance towards new challenges, new diplomatic challenges - challenges which, of course, have to do with our country's stability, growth, and economic and social growth.\n\nIt was a real pleasure for me to be able to discuss some important issues with you, issues which are at the very core of our concerns, of course; issues such as the crisis in the Mediterranean, with a special focus on Libya. We talked about the stability of Libya, which is an essential dossier as far as we're concerned. And it isn't just linked to our concerns of migration. It's also linked to our concerns with a possible terrorist risk. You all know that Libya is very close to Italy. Its territorial waters are waters in which sometimes our fishing boats go into, and therefore it is a region which is very close to us, to Sicily, to our borders. And I think it will be - it'll be very important to be able to meet at the Berlin conference. That's a conference we're already working on. And the role of the United States will be very important in the work we can do together as a way of stimulating all of the players involved in Libya to move towards a ceasefire without fostering any kind of tension, without any kind of escalation. In fact, we wish to work towards a de-escalation of things.\n\nAnd as I was mentioning to Secretary Pompeo, I am also very much concerned about the topic of tariffs. We're concerned because we have a number of companies in Italy which survive thanks to their exports. They're the ones which export the very best in wine and agri-food, and in handmade products. That's what our companies live off of.\n\nAnd as I was explaining to Secretary Pompeo, in the past we used to export our industrial plants, whereas nowadays we want to focus on exporting our products while keeping our plants here and our jobs here. That's very important. In a moment in time in which the European economy's slowing down, our companies need to have certainties. And of course, one such certainty is our relationship with the U.S. It is a fundamental relationship. It isn't just one based on trade; it is one based on friendship, on our economies. And sometimes it's a relationship in which our products are destined to the U.S.\n\nAnd of course, we as a government will do whatever we can to try to defend made-in-Italy products and our exports globally. We want to defend our products of excellence, and we want to do everything we can so that we can increase our export capacity without reducing it. We want to make sure that our companies can export even more, because they do so much for our economy. And I'm referring to our entrepreneurs in the north, central, and southern Italy, and on our islands.\n\nAnd as a way of concluding before I leave the floor to the Secretary of State, Mr. Pompeo, obviously, currently we wish to deal with all of the international challenges within the framework of our Atlantic alliance, and we wish to deal with these challenges with the very best of the diplomatic spirit that have always - has always characterized us. Any solution to a crisis has to be diplomatic, it has to be peaceful, and that is something we will always work on together so that we can continue to bring about economic and social growth in our respective countries.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you, Foreign Minister Di Maio. Grazie. You have been a most gracious host. I had wonderful meetings with President Mattarella and Prime Minister Conte yesterday, truly excellent hospitality in the finest Italian tradition. I look forward to showing your president Italian-American hospitality when he comes to Washington in just a couple of weeks.\n\nThe - we're both smiling because the deep and abiding ties between the United States and Italy are very personal for me. As the foreign minister said, I'm one of 20 million Americans who proudly claim Italian heritage, and the first one ever to serve as Secretary of State. Tomorrow I'll get a chance to go visit my ancestral home in Abruzzo, and I'm looking forward to meeting all my cousins. (Laughter.) And I hear the food is worth meeting as well.\n\nWe had an excellent discussion today about the close cooperation that lies ahead for the United States and the new Italian Government. That cooperation will be well served by President Trump's already strong relationship with President Mattarella and Prime Minister Conte. But our true bonds come from the central shared value set, a commitment to the same principles of democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human dignity.\n\nI was pleased to affirm America's commitment in particular to religious freedom earlier this morning at a conference that was held at the Vatican. Our principles together have produced a security partnership that has helped underpin peace and stability in the West for decades. We're very grateful for what Italy has done and its active leadership in Libya and in North Africa, as well as in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I'm also grateful that 30,000 men and women of the United States military, DOD civilians, and their family members can call Italy their temporary home. You are wonderful hosts for them, and we appreciate that.\n\nI know too that we can do more together. We should keep using the U.S.-Italy Strategic Dialogue to find ways to improve stability on Europe's southern frontier and grow our security cooperation in the Mediterranean. And we should continue to stand united against Iranian aggression. European nations have begun to wake up to the fact that Iran is the aggressor, not the aggrieved, and the fact is also clear from Italy's decision not to renew Mahan Air's access to Italy, and we're very grateful for that.\n\nI've asked for Italy's support too, and we talked about today the necessary task of confronting Nicolas Maduro for his repression and the socialist mismanagement that has taken place in Venezuela. EU sanctions should be enforced against Russia until such time that the situation changes materially.\n\nAnd finally, Italy is a friend and a sovereign nation with a right to make its own choices, but as I have done in Budapest and Bangkok, I urge my Italian friends to see how China uses its economic power to cultivate political influence and erode sovereignty. I raise concerns about China's zero-sum predatory approach to trade and investment, and what it could mean throughout Europe and Africa and the world at large. These are complicated issues with no easy answers, but my obligation is to speak the truth about these threats, a set of common threats which will continue to create confidence in our two peoples, that our partnership between our two countries will remain strong and enduring.\n\nMODERATOR: (Via interpreter) We'll begin with the Italian journalist, Francesca Sforza, La Stampa.\n\nQUESTION: (Via interpreter) Minister Di Maio, Secretary Pompeo, as far as the Berlin conference on Libya is concerned, and given the violence by the - by General Haftar's troops in - over the past few hours and days, how does the U.S. intend to support Italy's approach when it comes to ending the violence and to promote a ceasefire? With which interlocutors do you intend to work with, and how?\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: So we had extensive discussions today - we had them with President Mattarella and Prime Minister Conte as well - about Libya. Our mission set is very similar. We recognize that the first and most important thing we need to do is take down the level of violence, achieve a ceasefire, to convince all the relevant parties that are on the ground there, as well as those that have been supporting them from the outside, that a political solution is the only one that provides any real opportunity to create an outcome in Libya that is remotely adequate for Italy, but most importantly, for the people of Libya as well.\n\nSo our mission set, alongside our Italian partners, is to convince all of the relevant parties that the political process must move forward. And I'm hopeful that, whether it's the Berlin conference or some of the other work that's going to take place over the coming weeks, that we can achieve that outcome.\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER DI MAIO: (Via interpreter) This topic was obviously one which was discussed during all the talks we had last week in New York during the UNGA. And we agree on the principle that in order for there to be a ceasefire, there should be no countries which stimulate this conflict on the one side and on the other. And the moral suasion that a country like Italy can have is very important on some of the players involved in the conflict, be they Libyan players or non-Libyan players. But of course, the role, the moral suasion that a world power like the U.S. can exercise is just as important.\n\nAnd we believe that the Berlin conference, if prepared adequately, and by involving the players in the conflict as much as possible, we feel that this can lead to a further step forward. Of course, the step forward has to lead to a ceasefire, and has to lead towards a political process that can lead to the stabilization of Libya.\n\nMODERATOR: (Via interpreter) Vincenzo Nigro, la Repubblica.\n\nQUESTION: (Via interpreter) Good morning. I'd like to ask both of you to discuss the Iran issue in greater detail.\n\nSecretary Pompeo, do you think that returning to a negotiation, be it a direct or indirect negotiation - we all read about the alleged phone call between President Trump and President Rouhani at the UN. But does the Department of State favor a renewal in talks? And is it willing to reduce this maximum sanctions policy against Iran?\n\nAnd then I'd also like to ask Minister Di Maio: In your introductory speech, you said that Italy continues to prefer a diplomatic and political discussion to most serious crises in the world. And as far as the Mediterranean is concerned, of course, the most serious crisis is the Iranian one. Secretary Pompeo also mentioned Mahan Air, an Iranian airline company. I didn't understand if Italy will be willing to sanction that airline, too.\n\nAnd one final remark: Today, I think, is - marks the anniversary of the killing of the Saudi journalist, Mr. Khashoggi. Do you think that that murder will have an influence on the way in which our governments looks towards the main players in the Middle Eastern region?\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER DI MAIO: (Via interpreter) Let me start answering by saying that it's obvious, it's clear that we agree on the fact that as far as the Italian Government is concerned, but more generally speaking, the approach to any crisis has to be one which tends towards a de-escalation of things. Of course, that doesn't mean being neutral towards a region in which certain tensions exist, and Italy is concerned about these tensions.\n\nAs far as the Mahan Air dossier is concerned, in the next few days, I imagine the authorities which deal with air routes will be delivering (inaudible) decisions.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Our policy has been consistent for the now two and a half years of the Trump administration. The Islamic Republic of Iran is the world's largest state sponsor of terror and the primary destabilizing force throughout the Middle East. Our strategy has been to deny them the wealth and resources that they have used for 40 years now to conduct assassination campaigns right here in Europe; to engage with militias all around the world; to disrupt and gain political influence; to conduct terror campaigns around the world, and, as we've seen in the last half-dozen months, take European ships off the water in the Straits of Hormuz; to conducting attacks into Saudi Arabia; taking over 5 percent of the world's energy supply off the market. This is the Iran that the world confronts, and the United States and Iran confront it - excuse me, the United States and Italy confront it together.\n\nOur theory is working. ENTITY has fewer resources today than it did before. The Iranian leadership is having to make difficult decisions about resource allocation inside of their own country. And we remain hopeful that there will be an opportunity to discuss with the Iranians the path forward. We - President Trump has said repeatedly we are working every day to deter, with the maritime initiative that we have in the Strait of Hormuz, to de-escalate and to create opportunities for diplomacy. That's the approach that we have taken. It's the one that we'll continue to take.\n\nQUESTION: Hi, thank you. Mr. Secretary, sorry, this is going to be the second time in a week I have to ask you about something that's going on in Washington while we're not in Washington. This relates to the Ukraine situation and what's going on on the Hill.\n\nFirst of all, is it correct that you were on the phone call that President Trump had with President Zelensky on July 25th? And if so, are the accounts that we have all seen of it, including the transcript or partial transcript released by the White House, accurate and complete? And if you were on the call, did you hear anything on that in the conversation that raised a red flag, anything inappropriate or anything that gave you any concerns?\n\nAnd then secondly, you told - you said last week that you - as far as you knew, everyone at the State Department had acted appropriately in regards to Ukraine, including yourself. And so I'm - is that still the case? Is that still your belief? If it is, why object to the demand for deposition from the House committees on the Hill? And then do you have any concerns at all about what the State Department inspector general is going to be briefing to Hill staffers later today? Thank you very much.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Thanks, Matt. I'll try to answer questions four through seven first, and then one through three after that.\n\nBack to first principles. Your - the predicate of your final question about objecting to what the folks on Capitol Hill have asked is fundamentally not true. What we objected to was the demands that were put that are - deeply violate fundamental principles of separation of powers. They contacted State Department employees directly, told them not to contact legal counsel at the State Department. That's been reported to us. They said that the State Department wouldn't be able to be present. There are important constitutional prerogatives that the Executive Branch has to be present so that we can protect the important information so our partners, countries like Italy, have - can have confidence that the information that they provide to the State Department will continue to be protected.\n\nAnd so the response that I've provided to them was one that acknowledged that we will of course do our constitutional duty to cooperate with this co-equal branch, but we are going to do so in a way that is consistent with the fundamental values of the American system, and we won't tolerate folks on Capitol Hill bullying, intimidating State Department employees. That's unacceptable and it's not something that I'm going to permit to happen.\n\nAs for was I on the phone call? I was on the phone call. The phone call was in the context of - now, I guess I've been the Secretary of State for coming on a year and a half - I know precisely what the American policy is with respect to Ukraine. It's been remarkably consistent, and we will continue to try to drive those set of outcomes. It's what our team, including Ambassador Volker, we're focused on - was taking down the threat that Russia poses there in Ukraine. It was about helping the Ukrainians to get graft out and corruption outside of their government, and to help now this new government in the Ukraine build a successful, thriving economy. It's what the State Department officials that I've had the privilege to lead have been engaged in, and it's what we will continue to do, even while all this noise is going on.\n\nMS ORTAGUS: Okay. Chris O'Dea, National Review.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you both for being here. I'd like to, I guess, address the question to both of you. You can kind of take it in whichever order, whoever wants to kind of go first. Primarily oriented towards, I guess, what is conveniently termed kind of the Belt and Road these days, but in a - on a somewhat broader basis, not just with Huawei, but does the U.S. have any specific plans in terms of how to counter China's investment in these major critical infrastructure assets? And I ask that here because it seems like there is a very wide degree of those assets that are financed or operated in Italy by Chinese companies, and particularly in Port San Vito, obviously, and Trieste under the new BRI memorandum that was signed - bridges, roads, and highways as well.\n\nSo it seems like a great deal of Italy's economic infrastructure is kind of moving in a direction of sort of Chinese influence and the, I guess, underlying point is those types of things tend to require the Chinese companies to work very closely with Italian Government and financial institutions and get more deeply embedded in the way decisions are made and the way budget and resources are allocated.\n\nMS ORTAGUS: Okay. Thanks, Chris. Thanks.\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER DI MAIO: (Via interpreter) Well, I'm happy to answer, and of course, thank you very much for your question. In recent days, we have absorbed all of the department for foreign trade into the ministry for foreign affairs. I said this at the beginning, and I want to reiterate this in the presence of Secretary Pompeo: We are allies of the United States, and we share their concerns on certain strategic infrastructure, such as 5G for instance. And the concerns our allies have, and the information and the concerns of our authorities have led to new legislation here in Italy, making us one of the most advanced countries in terms of 5G security compared to the rest of Europe.\n\nWe have created a new golden power as far as 5G is concerned. We have recently approved a new decree which has immediately come into force, allowing us to define the cybersecurity framework as far as our country is concerned. And at the same time, we also have a committee which we have set up which will be assessing the accurate functioning of all of the systems being installed within our strategic infrastructure.\n\nNow, I want to say this because I want to make a clear distinction between our commercial MOUs, our trade MOUs, from our political concerns and our concerns vis-a-vis strategic infrastructure. And hopefully in the future we will be able to increasingly strengthen the relations and the agreements between the U.S. and Italy to secure our strategic infrastructure. We have no intention of signing trade agreements that can endanger our state's sovereignty. We are very careful whenever we sign trade agreements. We make sure that we include any possible guarantee so that European legislation is complied with, and so that the European principles are complied with, the principles with which we regulate our trade relations with other non-EU countries.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: I'd just add - we talked about this quite a bit, both yesterday and today - when China or Chinese companies show up and are prepared to compete on a fair, reciprocal basis, Italian companies, American companies will compete and will be incredibly successful. And we brook no ill towards those opportunities. It's when the Chinese Communist Party shows up under the guise of a commercial endeavor with an aim to really make an investment that is aimed - a political outcome, to gain political influence, to gain political power, or to threaten the nation's national security.\n\nThose are the things that every sovereign nation must protect against, and it's the kind of projects that I'm confident that I know the Italians will evaluate carefully and every European country will. They want to protect their people. They want to protect their citizens' data going across their systems from the Chinese Communist Party having access to that information. These are a set of shared threats, shared concerns not only with the United States and Italy, but the United States and all European nations.\n\nWhat President Trump has asked on the trade front is simply that China compete on a fair, reciprocal basis, that we get a set of trade agreements that permit that, that we get protections for basic private property rights, we can prevent China from stealing intellectual property. We don't - we no more want them to steal Italian intellectual property than we do American intellectual property. And I'm very confident that our two countries will work closely together to get those same set of outcomes that I know every Italian citizen and every American citizen wants as well. Thanks.\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER DI MAIO: Thank you very much.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. It was great to be with you."

Hizballah,1,"President Mauricio Macri of Argentina (left) became the first Latin American leader to designate Hezbollah a terrorist organization in July. Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benitez (right) became the second a few weeks later.\n\nThe counterterrorism conversation in Latin America is changing. On July 16, the Macri government of Argentina made history by becoming the first country in Latin America to officially designate Hezbollah a terrorist organization.\n\nLess than one month later, on August 9, the Paraguayan government followed suit and also officially recognized Hezbollah as a terror organization. Now, at least two other countries in the region are seriously considering issuing the same counterterrorism designation in the near future.\n\nRegardless of how long it takes, the proverbial train has left the station in Latin America and regional governments are waking up to the fact that Hezbollah is a terror threat in the Western hemisphere.\n\nLatin America is waking up to the fact that Hezbollah is a terror threat in the Western hemisphere.\n\nIt is important to note that these policy shifts do not happen in a vacuum. Regional counterterrorism cooperation is catalyzed by conversations that take place behind the scenes about Iran and Hezbollah's malign influence in the region. I have been fortunate enough to take part in some of these conversations, and here are the top five takeaways:\n\n1. Financial intelligence and oversight are paramount.\n\nDuring the recent Hezbollah terror designation in Argentina, the role of its financial intelligence unit was imperative in shaping internal government perspectives on Hezbollah and establishing the legal mechanisms for making the formal designation.\n\nMariano Federici, the head of Argentina's Financial Intelligence Unit\n\nOne year prior to the formal designation, the Financial Intelligence Unit of Argentina (Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera or UIF-AR by its Spanish acronym), led by Mariano Federici, froze the assets of 14 individuals belonging to the Barakat Clan, a powerful Lebanese crime family with ties to Hezbollah. One of the conduits for these Hezbollah money launderers was a casino in the city of Iguazú on the Argentine side of the Tri-Border Area (TBA). The UIF press release stated that \clan members allegedly collected money at the casino in Iguazú for fake prizes totaling more than $10 million, without declaring the funds when crossing the border.\"" This Argentine action on July 11, 2018 was more than symbolic: it was a legal precedent to prove that Hezbollah's financiers and facilitators are still active in Argentina.\n\nThis successful financial intelligence operation, coordinated with the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), was the first government action taken by President Mauricio Macri against Hezbollah. One year later, on July 16, 2019, President Macri signed Executive Decree 489, officially creating the \""Public Registry of Persons and Entities linked to Terrorism and its Financing\"" or RePET, by its Spanish acronym. The registry has been filled with more than 1,000 entries, many of them members, facilitators, or financiers of Hezbollah.\n\nIn the U.S. the Treasury Department, through its Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, led by Assistant Secretary Marshall Billingslea, has made historic advances, sanctioning more than 50 Hezbollah-related persons or entities since 2017 as part of a larger effort at dismantling Hezbollah's global financial network. The synchronization of these efforts by the U.S. and Argentina is a model for understanding how FIUs are a valuable tool to help regional governments build cases against Hezbollah in Latin America.\n\n2. Countering the convergence of crime and terror is critical.\n\nWhile Latin America may be relatively new to the intricacies involved in combatting Islamist terrorism, the region is certainly not new to countering transnational organized crime (CTOC). In most countries in Latin America, in fact, CTOC is among their top national security priorities. That is why, when the Department of Justice (DOJ), on October 15, 2018, designated Hezbollah as one of the world's top five transnational criminal organizations, many Latin American governments turned their attention to Hezbollah's illicit networks.\n\nLatin American governments are focusing more attention on Hezbollah's transnational criminal networks.\n\nThe relatively new Hezbollah Financing Narcoterrorism Team (HFNT) at the U.S. Department of Justice, led by Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Cronan, is doing critical work coordinating Hezbollah-related prosecutions across the country, and assisting foreign prosecutors in Latin America through training opportunities and workshops.\n\nOne of these training opportunities took place a month before Argentina designated Hezbollah as a terror organization, on June 12, 2019, when the U.S. and Argentina teamed up for a two-day workshop on Hezbollah. Law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and financial practitioners from six countries in South America traveled to Buenos Aires to discuss various techniques to constrain and counter Hezbollah's illicit activities. These efforts are led in Argentina by Security Minister Patricia Bullrich, who has also partnered with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in examining the convergence of crime and terror.\n\nThe National Defense University (NDU) has provided the intellectual horsepower on the topic and has already published two books on it. On July 15-16, 2019, the week of the 25th commemoration of Iran's bombing of the Jewish community center, AMIA, in Argentina, NDU's regional center, the William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies, partnered with Minister Bullrich and her team at the Argentine Ministry of Security for a workshop on the convergence of crime and terror, in which Hezbollah's role in Latin America was discussed at length. The approach of discussing Hezbollah as equal parts of crime and terror, allows the U.S. and Latin America to gain a full picture of the organization's transnational threat.\n\n3. Regional forums on counterterrorism cooperation are key.\n\nFor the past two years in Latin America, the Trump administration has been spearheading counterterrorism conferences, workshops, and events that allow the governments of the region to interact with one another and share their best practices on countering Hezbollah's crime and terror networks.\n\nDelegates of the First Hemispheric Counterterrorism Ministerial Conference assemble in Washington, DC, on December 11, 2018.\n\nA series of ministerial counterterrorism conferences have proven to be among the most prominent in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe first ministerial conference on counterterrorism in many years took place on December 11, 2018, when senior officials from 13 countries in Latin America came to Washington D.C. to work together to address regional gaps to counter terrorist threats. As U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan said at the time:\n\n[T]ransnational terrorism poses an immediate threat to us here in the Western Hemisphere. Although the perceived center of gravity seems far away, groups like ISIS, al-Qa'ida, and Lebanese ENTITY operate where they can find recruits, raise support, operate unchecked, and pursue their terrorist agendas.\n\nLater in his speech, Deputy Secretary Sullivan called on our regional partners to do more as \""our safety depends on working with all of you [in Latin America] on security as we continue to improve our own.\""\n\nDeputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan\n\nHis call was answered at the Second Hemispheric Counterterrorism Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires, on July 19, 2019, when an additional five countries joined the event, and Brazil moved from being an observer to a member. At the Second Ministerial Conference, 18 regional governments signed a joint communiqué on counterterrorism cooperation, acknowledging, and expressing concern for, Hezbollah's regional presence. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended to show solidarity with Argentina's terror designation of Hezbollah and encourage other regional governments also to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. Colombia will host the third ministerial counterterrorism conference, scheduled to take place in Bogota in mid-January 2020.\n\nIt did not take long for the impact of these summits to prompt Argentina's neighbors. Just a few weeks after it, on August 9, 2019, Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benitez signed Executive Decree 2307, officially recognizing Hezbollah as a terrorist organization in Paraguay, and accentuating the Lebanese terror group's presence in the Tri-Border Area (TBA). Later that month, on August 22, 2019, regional officials traveled to the TBA for the inaugural inter-agency Trinational Security Conference in Foz do Iguaço, Brazil. All of the senior actors involved in designating Hezbollah a terror group in Argentina and Paraguay took part in it, as did important security officials from Brazil's Ministry of Justice and Federal Police, thereby placing additional impetus on Brazil also to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.\n\n4. Congressman and Parliamentarians shape the narrative.\n\nMany regional forums helped shape the narrative and increased cooperation in countering terrorism in Latin America, prior to the official ministerial conferences. Among the most significant was the Parliamentary Intelligence Security Forum (PISF), organized by Robert Pittenger, a former Congressman from North Carolina. Congressman Pittenger has been organizing the PISF for several years; he held the first regional forum in Buenos Aires on November 21, 2016, with the UIF and the National Congress of Argentina. It was at this 2016 forum, almost three years ago, that initial conversations took place about the need to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization in Argentina.\n\nThe author of this article, Joseph M. Humire, speaks at the Parliamentary Intelligence Security Forum in Asuncion, Paraguay, on January 14, 2019.\n\nFast forward a few years, and a more recent regional PISF was in Asuncion, Paraguay, on January 14, 2019; it was this event that prompted Paraguay's recent terror designation of Hezbollah. Above all, the parliamentarians who attended these forums worked diligently to help fellow legislators in their countries understand the legal vacuum in Latin America regarding international terrorism.\n\nThis was certainly true for Argentine Congressman Luis Petri, the head of the National Security Commission in the Argentine Congress, who worked closely with Macri's government to find the political and legal path toward designating Hezbollah a terror organization. Prior to the designation, Congressman Petri carefully communicated the Macri government's efforts with regional and extra-regional allies, and after the designation, amplified the news in Brazil, Paraguay, and the United States.\n\nCongressman Petri also took part in the initial PISF in 2016, the ministerial in Buenos Aires in 2019, and recently presented at the Trinational Security Conference in Foz do Iguaço, Brazil, as well as an event organized by the Center for a Secure Free Society (SFS) at the U.S. Senate. His efforts have been vital in shaping the narrative as to why the terror designation of Hezbollah is important for Latin America.\n\n5. Public awareness and education are needed to ensure that the designations are sustainable.\n\nArgentine President Macri's leadership and political will have succeeded in establishing tremendous momentum for other Latin American governments to think critically about Hezbollah, as evidenced in President Abdo's recognition of the Lebanese terror group in Paraguay last month.\n\nAdditional designations may be coming from President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil (left) and President Ivan Duque of Colombia.\n\nAt this moment, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, and President Ivan Duque of Colombia, are working potentially to designate Hezbollah in their own countries for what it is -- a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nWhat happens, however, when political winds shift, and new politicians come to power in Latin America who may have less political will to tackle this problem?\n\nThat is why it is incredibly important to raise the public's awareness and educate Latin Americans on the nature of Hezbollah's crime and terror networks. Several efforts have been made for several years by like-minded non-governmental organizations and think tanks, such as the Gatestone Institute, Middle East Forum, Fuente Latina, Foundation for Defense of Democracies, American Foreign Policy Council, and many more, that have been at the forefront of catalyzing a region-wide conversation on the issue. I also have worked diligently alongside these organizations and with my own, the Center for a Secure Free Society (SFS), to educate Latin American leaders and the public on the transnational terror threat that Hezbollah poses to their countries, but far more needs to be done.\n\nMalcolm Hoenlein, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, emphasized this point in a moving speech at a recent SFS event on Capitol Hill when he reminded us that \""while Jews are often the first victims [of Hezbollah attacks] we are never the last...\"" The AMIA attack may have taken place 25 years ago, it may be perceived as simply an attack on Jewish-Argentines, not the country of Argentina. But this is wrong. The AMIA attack serves to remind us that the threat is close to home, and recent Hezbollah-related cases in Peru and Paraguay show that their terror actions in Latin America are far from over.\n\nThe time is long overdue for Latin America to catch up to the world in counterterrorism cooperation against Hezbollah.\n\nThe recent designations in Argentina and Paraguay of Hezbollah as a terrorist group are just the beginning. A window is open for other Latin American countries to follow in their footsteps and now, thanks to Argentina, we have a roadmap for how to do it. 2019 is critical because as political winds often shift in Latin America, the momentum throughout the region must not be stopped.\n\nThe time is long overdue for Latin America to catch up to the world in counterterrorism cooperation to stop Hezbollah from taking root and spreading its influence in our hemisphere.\n\nJoseph M. Humire is the executive director of the Center for a Secure Free Society (SFS), a fellow at the Middle East Forum, and a distinguished senior fellow at the Gatestone Institute."
Hizballah,1,"Yves here. This article presents Iran as having a grand strategy that is presently winning. The piece quotes recent statements from some of Iran's top officials and house organs. But an open question is how much of this is aspirational.\n\nThe reason for wondering whether the author has overstated his case is his depiction of the famed Houthi attack on Saudi oil facilities as \Iran-sponsored\"" is conjecture. As David pointed in out comments on Links yesterday:\n\nEscobar makes the same mistake that other commentators have made when he quotes the Merkel/Macron /Johnson statement on the attacks. Far from suggesting that Iran was 'definitively ' responsible for the attacks, the statement just says that the only 'plausible' interpretation is that Iran 'bears responsibility' for them. It doesn't suggest that Iran has sole responsibility, and it doesn't suggest the attacks came from Iran or were carried out by the Iranians. Statements like this are drafted with exquisite care, and if the three nations had evidence of direct Iranian involvement they would have said something different. Decoded, the statement says essentially ' we are pretty sure that the Iranians were involved in some way, but we are not sure how and we need to find out more.' The statement may merely allege that the Iranians agreed to the attacks, or even encouraged them. It may also mean that Iran gave the Houthis technical assistance or training. So in practice Escobar's source (who talks only about missiles, interestingly, not drones) isn't necessarily contradicting the European statement.\n\nBy Yossef Bodansky, the Director of Research at the International Strategic Studies Association (ISSA) and Senior Editor of Defense & Foreign Affairs publications (including the Global Information System: GIS) He was, for more than a decade, the Director of the US House of Representatives Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare. Originally published OilPrice\n\nThere was little doubt by late September 2019 that Iran's clerical leadership was truly in command of the dynamic of the transformation of the Persian Gulf region.\n\nThe crux of the Iranian regional strategy - including the Iran-sponsored rôle of the Houthi pre-dawned unmanned aerial vehicle strikes on Saudi Arabian oil facilities on September 14, 2019 - became increasingly clear as the shock of those strikes began to be absorbed.\n\nTehran was playing a masterful game, delicately balancing between its publicized confrontation with the US in the Persian Gulf and its real quest for a regional power status.\n\nThe Iran-proxy strike on Saudi Arabia and the ensuing threats to the US served both as a demonstration of the impotence of Saudi Arabia and its guardians, and as a diversion of attention away from the crucial and successful Iranian surge westward to the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Iranian declaratory threats of escalation remained focused on the Persian Gulf and particularly on warning the US against intervention. The Houthi strike reiterated anew the inherent vulnerability of Saudi Arabia, as well as its inability and unwillingness to act unilaterally against Iran. Tehran has long insisted that the US is reluctant to act against Iran, and every passing day reinforces the veracity of the Iranian message.\n\nHence, Tehran argues, all regional states and entities should take notice of the inherent power of Iran and Iran's proxies, as well as of the absence of US protection. Iran urges these states and entities to use the Houthi strike as an excuse to bring the current crisis to an end under conditions favorable to Iran.\n\nIranian Pres. Hassan Rouhani introduced the concept in the cabinet meeting of September 18, 2019. He explained that the Houthi strike was \""a warning to the enemies to end war and conflicts in the region\"". There was, he indicated, an urgent imperative to exploit and capitalize on the current shock. \""Enemies of the region should take lesson from this warning and should be after extinguishing the fire of war in the region to let the people live in freedom and welfare,\"" Rouhani said.\n\nIn a major speech delivered on September 22, 2019, Rouhani elaborated on the theme and now urged all the Persian Gulf states to reconcile with Iran and reject US intervention. Iran was ready to \""extend the hand of friendship and fraternity to all of its neighboring states\"" in the current \""critical and historic\"" juncture. \""In this regard, we are even ready to forgive their past mistakes, because today we are faced with conditions in which the enemies of the region, particularly the US, the arrogance and the Zionism, are seeking to exploit the gap, rift, and division among the regional countries,\"" Rouhani said.\n\nTime was of essence because \""enemies of Islam and the region seek to make the most out of our division\"". \""The presence of foreign forces can be dangerous for the region, international waters, as well as the security of shipping lines and energy, but [Iran's] path is to create unity and coordination with regional countries.\""\n\nRouhani questioned the sincerity of the US claim to be pursuing regional peace. \""If they [the Americans] are telling the truth, they'd better not turn the region into a stage of arms race,\"" he said, \""if they are after [establishing] security, they'd better get out of the region.\"" He further reminded the US of Iran's steadfast stand during the debilitating war with Iraq. Rouhani concluded that \""today's enemies of the country [should] think twice before deciding any attack on our soil and imposing another war on our nation. They don't have the courage to make a move against Iran's great armed forces and nation and will never find that courage.\""\n\nAs before, Tehran relied on ENTITY Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah to deliver the more explicit and threatening message.\n\nIn a sermon on September 20, 2019, Nasrallah analyzed the situation in the Persian Gulf. He noted that the world reaction to the Houthi strike \""clearly showed how expensive is oil once compared to blood. Saudi warplanes continue to kill Yemeni children, but no concrete action is taken (to stop the onslaught).\"" He stressed the futility of Riyadh's policies. \""Saudi Arabia is highly advised to stop the war on Yemen instead of seeking to purchase advanced air defense missile systems. All costly weapons purchased from the United States cannot protect you from drone attacks.\""\n\nHe warned Riyadh of US duplicity, explaining that \""Trump has commenced a new process of milking the Saudi kingdom. Trump is desperately seeking for a bilateral meeting with his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani.\"" Nasrallah emphasized the futility of confronting Iran and its allies. \""Continuing the war against Yemen with no [political] solution is pointless. You are starting to pay the price,\"" Nasrallah warned the Saudis. \""One strike knocked out half the oil production, and another strike, you can imagine what it will do,\"" he taunted.\n\n\""Don't bet on a war against Iran because they will destroy you. Your house is made of glass and your economy is made of glass. Like the glass cities in the UAE. ... You have already begun to pay the price of the war against Yemen.\"" Saudi Arabia \""should think well, as a war with Iran will mean their destruction.\"" Nasrallah concluded by reiterating the regional ramifications of the Houthi strike. \""This attack shows the strength of the Axis of Resistance,\"" Nasrallah said.\n\nIn a September 22, 2019, interview with Al-Alam TV, Nasrallah raised the ante by insisting that ENTITY had its own reasons for confronting the House of al-Sa'ud. He explained that the \""ruling regime of Saudi Arabia has got very old and is spending the last stages of its lifetime\"". Riyadh should not complain about its plight because this is a natural outcome of its long-term policies. \""In fact, Saudi Arabia was the initiator of hostility against Iran, and its problem with Iran was the same problem it had with other Arab countries, namely, [over] supporting the Palestinian issue and regional resistance movements,\"" Nasrallah said.\n\nGiven this background, Nasrallah said, \""this is not a proxy war and we believe that Saudi Arabia is hostile to [the] Lebanese resistance forces, regardless of Iran's position, so our problem with Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with Iran\"".\n\nThe next day, September 23, 2019, Iran's Press TV also published an interview with Nasrallah. He repeated his observation that \""the al-Sa'ud regime may be in the final stages of its life, and the incumbent rulers are expediting the regime's demise through their policies. ... [The] al-Sa'ud regime is old and may be in the final stages of its life because of natural reasons like its cruel measures over the past 100 years and the systematic corruption in the regime, suppression of people, and totalitarianism of its rules.\"" Nasrallah pointed to the growing anti-Saudi sentiments throughout the Arab World. \""We currently see for the first time that 'Death to al-Sa'ud' slogan is being chanted in several Arab countries, and we see political and popular powers and governments that take explicit stances toward al-Sa'ud and its interference in the region.\""\n\nHe reiterated Tehran's long-term grievances against Riyadh. \""Saudi Arabia started its hostility toward Iran after the victory of the Islamic Revolution [in 1979] and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, which supported the issues of Arab and Islamic countries.\"" Hence, Saudi Arabia should not be surprised by Iran's determination to triumph in the Persian Gulf region to the detriment of Saudi interests.\n\nOn September 23, 2019, Kayhan published an interview with Sheikh Nabil Qaouq, the Deputy Chairman of the ENTITY's Executive Council. He noted that the Houthi \""operation against the Saudi oil facilities ushered in a new era in the region, which [is] not favorable to the US and its regional client states\"". Consequently, \""Saudi Arabia is in despair, because it has spent hundreds of billions of dollars to purchase weapons and gain US support, but all to no avail.\"" Meanwhile, \""the US Administration is now embarrassed and distraught\"".\n\nQaouq further noted that \""the occupying regime of Israel\"" is also \""alarmed by the severity and accuracy\"" of the Houthi strikes, and is now \""fearing similar strikes on Zionist targets\"". This Israeli dread, Qaouq explained, had an overarching adverse impact on the US posture in the region given Israel's importance.\n\n\""The US axis in the region is retreating now as it admits its defeats in Iraq, Yemen, Syria, the besieged Gaza Strip, and Lebanon, and also against Iran.\"" With the pro-Iran regional camp rising, the US and its proxies \""receive new defeats every day, while the Axis of Resistance continues to add to its achievements and victories\"". Qaouq focused on the plight of Saudi Arabia. \""Saudi Arabia now faces two prospects, either humiliation or defeat. ... If the Saudi regime stays longer in Yemen, it will be humiliated. And if it pulls its forces out of Yemen, there will be a heavy defeat for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi Army, and the Arab Kingdom's status in the region,\"" Qaouq said. Under such circumstances, he concluded, there was no alternative but to accept the new regional posture: that of the ascent of Iran and the Shi'ite allies.\n\nMeanwhile, Tehran started to introduce stronger and more explicit aspects of the evolving Iranian grand strategy.\n\nOn September 20, 2019, the authoritative Ayatollah Ahmad Alamolhoda, a protégé of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, discussed Iran's new regional posture in a Friday Sermon. He stressed the Iranian regional dominance because \""Iran is the resistance in the region\"". Iran was, he said, no longer limited to a \""geographical location\"" because all of Iran's proxies throughout the region were \""all Iran\"" now.\n\n\""Iran, today, is not only Iran and not limited to a geographical location. Iraq's Hashd al-Shaabi, Lebanon's ENTITY, Yemen's AnsarAllah, Syria's National Defense Forces, Palestine's Islamic Jihad and the Hamas are all Iran,\"" Alamolhoda stated. \""Do you even know where Iran is? Isn't [the] south of Lebanon Iran? Isn't ENTITY Iran? The drones sent by the Yemenis that caused such damage to Saudi Arabia: wasn't that Iran? You say that (these drones) came from the north and not from the south. South or north, what difference does it make? Iran is both to your south and to your north. Today there is an alert Muslim in every part of this region, (and any place) where a fighting movement exists is Iran and its Imam is Iran and its leader is Iran.\""\n\nAlso on September 20, Maj.-Gen. Yahya Rahim Safavi, the top military aide to Khamene'i, delivered a sermon in Tehran to a select group of senior officials and officers. He analyzed Iran's emerging regional and global posture. \""With the grace of God and thanks to the vigilance and patience of the great Iranian nation and the unforgettable sacrifices of 200,000 martyrs ... the Iranian nation has become an invincible regional power in West Asia,\"" Safavi said.\n\n\""The Islamic Republic has turned into a major and invincible power in West Asia and if the Americans are planning any plots in the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea or the Indian Ocean, Iran will not leave them unanswered. ... If the Americans think of any plots against Iran, the Islamic Republic's will respond from an area extending from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean,\"" he warned. \""Any anti-Iranian move will overturn the region.\""\n\nSafavi explained that one of the key factors facilitating the ascent of Iran was the ongoing global transformation along the principles pursued by the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Russia. Consequently, he stressed, \""[the] US' policies in West Asia and its hegemony are defeated as the world is moving towards multilateralism\"".\n\nThese emerging circumstances enabled Iran to expect conducive regional dynamics while seeking a favorable regional posture. \""Our policy is to create lasting peace and security in the region and (seek) the withdrawal of foreign forces, and we hope that our trans-regional enemies would know that Iran does not intend to invade (other countries) or expand its territory,\"" Safavi said. As for more remote nemeses like Israel, Safavi reminded them of the assertion by ENTITY Leader Nasrallah that \""any move against Tehran will throw the whole region in a great turmoi\"".\n\nOther senior officers elaborated on these themes over the next few days. On September 21, 2019, IRGC Commander Maj.-Gen. Hossein Salami addressed a select group in Tehran. He assured them that Iran was \""ready for any type of scenario\"" the US and its allies might contrive. Iran was preparing to fight the war on enemy territory. \""Our readiness for giving response to any aggression is definitely assured. Now, whoever wishes to turn its land into a battleground is free to start it. But we will never allow the war be dragged into our land,\"" Salami stated.\n\nHe stressed Iran's commitment to a decisive victory. \""We will stand till the end because the response to a limited strike will not be limited. We will pursue any aggressor. We are after punishment and we will continue until the full destruction of any aggressor. ... We are result-oriented and good at follow-up. We have proven it. We won't spare any secure place [for our enemies]. So be careful and don't make a strategic mistake,\"" he advised Iran's enemies.\n\nAlso on September 21, IRGC Deputy Commander Rear Adm. Ali Fadavi emphasized the new stature of Iran: \""Today defending the values of [the] Islamic Revolution does not know any geographical boundaries and many people want to sacrifice their lives in the path of truth.\"" The next day, September 22, Iranian Navy Commander Rear Adm. Hossein Khanzadi also warned Iran's enemies of the dire consequences of attacking Iran. \""In case of any miscalculation and aggression by the enemy, [the] Army's Navy, along with other armed forces of the country, will give the most crushing reaction in the shortest time possible,\"" he claimed. \""Today, the Islamic Republic of Iran's defense power is at its highest possible level and [the] forces of [the] Army and [the] IRGC are ready to defend [the] marine borders of the country.\""\n\nKhanzadi belittled the threat posed by the US and its allies. \""No one should worry at all about the theatrical and fake coalitions that they form under the pretext of regional security. This region's security is established by the Islamic Republic of Iran and the regional states' naval forces.\""\n\nAddressing the Iranian Parliament on September 24, 2019, Iranian Armed Forces Chief of Staff Maj.-Gen. Mohammad Bagheri articulated Iran's Persian Gulf strategy.\n\nHe differentiated between efforts to reconcile with the regional Arab states and the possibility of a major war with the US to the detriment of the US' local allies. Tehran saw no difference between economic sanctions and the use of force.\n\n\""Today, enemies, who are fearful of a war with Iran, have taken the path of economic terrorism,\"" Baqeri said. The only viable issues were the specter of escalation and the Iranian response. \""We have repeatedly told our enemies that we will stand strong against acts of aggression and the same response that was given to the intruding (US) drone, and intruding UK fleet and ship will be given to any other aggressor. [The] result of aggression against Iran will be destruction and captivity,\"" Bagheri asserted.\n\nBagheri contrasted the Iranian resolve to defeat any US and allied forces with what the Iranian clerical leadership claims was the absence of animosity toward any of Iran's neighbors.\n\nIran was convinced that \""Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which are leading conspiracies against [Iran] in the region, are Islamic countries and have lost their path. They should return to the path of Islam and come closer to Iran. That is when we will have a secure and prospering region.\""\n\nThis would surely happen once the Arabs states pulled away from the US influence and became true to their Islamic selves. Bagheri offered military cooperation to the Arab and Muslim worlds as part of mutual security arrangements and agreements. \""(Now that) we have an independent defense industry in Iran today, these (military advances) belong to the Muslim world and everyone should know that regional security is provided by the cooperation of regional countries,\"" Bagheri stated. Tehran was eager to bring the Persian Gulf crisis to an amicable solution, which must include the banishment of the US and its Western allies, so that Tehran could focus better on the implementation of Iran's regional surge.\n\nFor Tehran, the Persian Gulf is but a component in Iran's true regional strategy and aspirations as articulated by Khamene'i on September 11, 2019. On September 22, 2019, the powerful Speaker of the Parliament, Ali Larijani, put everything in context, combining the Persian Gulf strategy with the surge to the Mediterranean strategy. Larijani stated that the formation by the US of \""a coalition to create so-called security in the Strait of Hormuz\"" was \""a new means for plundering the region\"".\n\nIran would not permit this to continue. \""The security of the Strait of Hormuz finds meaning with the security of other international waterways. Iran won't let the Persian Gulf become a playground for adventurism. Iran believes that this measure [the US-led coalition] is the start of an operation to destroy regional security,\"" Larijani said. Tehran was urging the Arab states across the Persian Gulf to adopt a mutual security regime which would replace the US. \""The regional countries, themselves, are capable of establishing security and the Islamic Iran's Armed Forces do not allow the Persian Gulf to be played with [as a tool] to create insecurity in the region.\""\n\nHowever, Larijani emphasized that the primary source of threats to Iran and its allies was not the US operations in the Persian Gulf but rather the US-Israeli cooperation in Syria and Iraq. The US objective was \""to prepare [the] domination of the occupying regime in Tel Aviv over regional states\"". A major instrument in this conspiracy were the US-sponsored jihadist forces in Syria and Iraq which operated against Iran and its local proxies.\n\n\""America is now helping terrorists and this is not a secret to us. But they should know that Iranian forces gave a heavy blow to terrorists in the region. Terrorists endangered the lives of Muslims. But the West should know that terrorist groups like ISIL will one day fly at them.\""\n\nUltimately, however, Iran considered Israel to be the main threat to Iran's regional interests. \""Tel Aviv is acting as the main enemy of the countries of the Middle East,\"" Larijani said. \""The Islamic Republic of Iran is a friend and brother of all regional countries while the Zionist regime is a major enemy of Muslims.\"" This determined Iran's security priorities. \""We know that our main duty today is to defend the oppressed Palestinian nation\"": that is, to fight Israel.\n\nLarijani concluded by highlighting Iran's achievements to-date.\n\n\""Our armed forces are stronger than ever. Security of Islamic Iran and the region is provided by our forces which are great assets for the region. When Iraq and Syria had been plagued by terrorism, it was our armed forces which defeated them. Despite the authority and power that the Iranian military has, Iran has never invaded a country in the past 40 years.\"" Larijani repeated Tehran's urging for the entire Arab World to build new relations of friendship, cooperation, and confidence with Iran.\n\n\""We emphasize that Islamic and Arab countries are our brothers and we wish to have good ties, in areas of culture and economy, with our neighbors.\"" The mutual challenge was in evicting all \""foreign entities\"" from the region, starting with the US and Israel. \""It is necessary to use [all] our energy power to counter outsiders and Zionists,\"" Larijani asserted.\n\nThe possibility that Israel would support the US operations in the Persian Gulf raised the urgency of confronting Israel to a higher level. On September 21, 2019, the Commander of the Iranian Army Maj.-Gen. Sayyed Abdolrahim Mousavi stressed the point. \""The Persian Gulf is our home and we will not allow a regime like the Israeli regime to enter our home.\"" He warned that \""any wrong move by Tel Aviv will even shorten its life.\"" Ayatollah Ahmad Alamolhoda warned that any attempt to \""trespass [Iran's] border\"" would lead to \""Israel becoming dust in half a day.\""\n\nHowever, as repeatedly stressed by Khamene'i, the top Iranian priority was to sustaining and strengthening the \""Axis of the Resistance\"" and particularly the on-land access to the Mediterranean it provided. The struggle over this access, rather than the Persian Gulf, was the most explosive clash point.\n\nIranian and Shi'ite officials have reiterated that Israel was the primary concern in this context. This was because it was Israel which was actually challenging the consolidation of the on-land access to the Mediterranean through repeated bombings and raids. And, as reiterated by Safavi, Nasrallah, and many other leaders, any move against Tehran and/or its vital interests \""will throw the whole region into a great turmoil\"".\n\nWith tensions rising quickly, the Hashd al-Shaabi immediately started to implement the concrete resolutions reached during the secret visit to Baghdad of Qods Force Commander Maj.-Gen. Qassem Soleimani on September 16, 2019. Two days later, on September 18, Hashd al-Shaabilaunched Operation The Will of Victory under the command of Col. Qassem Masliyah of the Qods Force.\n\nThe objective of the operation was to have sizeable units of Hashd al-Shaabi seize Iraq's borders with Saudi Arabia and Jordan, on top of the Iraqi border with Syria which it already controlled. In key points along both borders, Hashd al-Shaabi was to build staging facilities for surges by Shi'ite forces against Riyadh from the north and Jerusalem from the east. The actual seizure of the entire border with Saudi Arabia and Jordan was completed on September 21, 2019. Hashd al-Shaabi deployed several thousand mechanized troops with artillery and support units. The local Iraqi units withdrew peacefully.\n\nMeanwhile, the IRGC [Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps] started to transfer dozens of ballistic missiles to Hashd al-Shaabi. Initially, these missiles would be deployed in Diyala province. To reduce their vulnerability to Israeli strikes, the missiles were dispersed among numerous bases and concealed sites. These missiles were intended to both replace the losses caused by the recent Israeli bombings and to increase the arsenals in accordance with the contingency plans for the forthcoming surge and escalation by the Axis of the Resistance.\n\nThe Iranians also started delivering supplies for the newly announced air force of Hashd al-Shaabi. The first weapons delivered were \""anti-drone weapons\"" and a wide variety of anti-aircraft guns.\n\nOfficial Baghdad was not oblivious to both Operation The Will of Victory and the massive resupply effort.\n\nHence, on September 22, 2019, Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi announced a new \""restructuring initiative\"" for Hashd al-Shaabi which would expedite and smooth their \""ongoing integration into the Iraqi Army\"". Abdul-Mahdi appointed Falah al-Fayyad of Hashd al-Shaabi to be in charge of implementing these steps. Baghdad's rhetoric notwithstanding, the real objective of the new initiative was to provide fig-leaf legitimization for the surge of Hashd al-Shaabi, the dramatic changes along Iraq's borders, and the Iran-controlled war preparations.\n\nPolitically, Tehran continued focusing on stocking anti-US sentiments in order to compel the US out of the greater Middle East.\n\nThe September 14, 2019, Houthi strike on the Saudi oil installations was a major contribution to this effort.\n\nHowever, the focus remained on the surge of Iran and its Axis of Resistance to the Mediterranean, and the struggle with Israel to make this happen. The two foci of Iranian operations are intertwined, however.\n\nIran seems convinced that once the US withdrew from the greater Middle East then Israel would no longer enjoy a free hand to strike with impunity against Iranian and Iran-proxy targets throughout the region. Until then, Iran would keep consolidating the Shi'ite Crescent and escalating the push westward despite Israel's strikes. At the same time, Iran simultaneously intensifying the challenges to the US where it hurt: striking the US' Persian Gulf protectorates and their hydrocarbon infrastructure.\n\nIf this dual track approach failed to deliver the anticipated results quickly, Tehran would escalate further, ordering Iran's proxies to strike US forces and vital interests throughout the greater Middle East.\n\nIran has indicated that it was adamant on winning, and that it was ready to pay whatever price it would take. And presently, Iran's strategy is succeeding."

Stand With Hong Kong,\"" sparking a wave of online criticism -- much of it from China, a market in which the Texas-based team has long been extremely popular for featuring the now-retired Chinese hall of famer Yao Ming.\n\nSince early in the year, Hong Kong has seen a string of massive demonstrations sparked by concerns about a proposed extradition law that would allow the transfer of suspects accused of a crime to jurisdictions with which the city lacks an extradition deal, including mainland China.\n\nThe protesters have since broadened their issues of concern and turned the demonstrations into a wider pro-democracy movement.\n\nAs the Morey furor continued to rumble through NBA circles and elsewhere, ENTITY co-founder and owner of the Brooklyn Nets Joe Tsai released a statement which Silver called \""a fairly lengthy explanation from his standpoint on why (Morey's) words are so hurtful to Chinese fans.\""\n\n\""As a governor of one of the 30 NBA teams, and a Chinese having spent a good part of my professional life in China, I need to speak up,\"" wrote Tsai, who took control of the Nets in August.\n\n(Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey and Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta speak during Game Four of the Western Conference Semifinals of the 2019 NBA Playoffs on May 6, 2019 at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas.)[NBAE/Getty/Kyodo]\n\n\""There are certain topics that are third-rail issues in certain countries, societies and communities...Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all citizens in China.\""\n\nResponding to criticism that the NBA put its economic interests ahead of defending Morey and his right to express his views, Silver was clear.\n\n\""What I am supporting is his freedom of political expression in this situation,\"" he said.\n\n\""I am also supporting Joe Tsai. I realize, as I said again, these are complex issues they don't lend themselves easily to social media. I can't ultimately run the NBA based on trying to satisfy everyone on Twitter.\""\n\n\""For those who choose also to engage, they'll see that we are dealing with a complex set of issues. And I will just add that the fact that we have apologized to fans in China is not inconsistent with supporting someone's right to have a point of view.\""\n\nThe Rockets quickly distanced themselves from Morey's tweet, with the team's owner Tilman Fertitta tweeting \""@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization.\""\n\nMorey retreated from his earlier post, tweeting an explanation while reiterating the words were his own, not the Rockets' or the NBA's.\n\n\""I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event,\"" he wrote.\n\n\""I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\""\n\nFormer U.S. presidential hopeful and Houston Rockets fan Ted Cruz also weighed in, saying the NBA is \""shamefully retreating\"" in pursuit of big dollars.\n\nBut Silver was resolute in his organization's position that members of the NBA community are free to express themselves and the league backs their right to do so.\n\n\""There are the values that have been part of this league from its earliest days, and that includes free expression,\"" he said.\n\n\""I accept that it is also Chinese governments' and Chinese businesses' right to react to those words and, at least from my long-time experience in the NBA, it will take some time to heal some of these issues.\""\n\n\""We are a platform in which people can engage and I would like to believe that for each side who believes they have a point of view here, that this engagement is positive.\""\n\nSilver said he has had many conversations with NBA staff in the China and Hong Kong offices which gave him perspective on both sides of the equation.\n\n\""I recognize that words truly do matter. There is no doubt we have a large presence in China, we have a large presence in Hong Kong.\""\n\n\""As complex as I understood these issues were, as I talked to them I realize how emotional they are, and how careful the league needs to be.\""\n\nSilver even said he believes that, despite the significant short-term pain the controversy is causing the NBA as it endeavors to build its brand across Asia, some good may come out of it.\n\n\""I would like to believe, as a combination of Daryl Morey's tweet and Joe Tsai's response, that many sports fans that don't pay all that much attention to politics, or to the situation in China and Hong Kong, may as a result know far more now about the situation.\""\n\n\""I hope I am not naive in saying that I think at the end of the day some positive will come from this"

China,0,"BEIJING -- Among the 100,000 almost entirely domestic participants in ENTITY's military-led parade on Tuesday was a float bearing a dozen hand-picked foreigners -- a token tribute to overseas links at time when many of ENTITY's foreign ties are strained.\n\nThe 12 foreigners, including two Americans and citizens from African and European countries, joined the parade that featured some of ENTITY's most advanced military technology, including dozens of jets, intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of hitting the United States, and 15,000 soldiers.\n\n\They picked 12 people in the whole world and I happen to be one of them. It's quite an honor,\"" said Beijing-based American businessman Gary Dvorchak, whose family ties with President Xi Jinping date to Xi's often-mythologised visit to the U.S. state of Iowa in 1985.\n\nXi, at the time a member of a small provincial delegation on an agricultural tour, stayed with Dvorchak's family.\n\n\""My government contacts called in June and asked if I want to be in an event on national day ... I didn't know until two weeks ago that it was the parade,\"" Dvorchak told Reuters a day before the celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of ENTITY.\n\n\""They couldn't tell me what it was, but they said it'll be the honor of a lifetime, so I said 'OK'.\""\n\nThe nationally broadcast parade is a show of power by Xi, who has spearheaded a campaign for military modernization.\n\nIt is also a largely domestic affair, without any visiting heads of state.\n\nStill, ENTITY is at pains to present a friendly face to a world that is wary of its economic and military rise in the midst of a bitter dispute with the United States over trade and technology.\n\nPositive perceptions of ENTITY in Western countries have been eroded in the past year, according to a report released this week by the U.S.-based Pew Research Centre, as trade, diplomatic and human rights rows take a toll on its image.\n\nENTITY's displays of overseas friendship, often enlisting foreigners, are sometimes awkward.

China,0,"For the fourth time in American history, impeachment proceedings have been launched against a sitting president. In 1868, 11 articles of impeachment were levied against Andrew Johnson for violating the Tenure of Office Act by firing Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Johnson had vetoed that law; it was overridden; and later declared unconstitutional. Johnson was acquitted in the Senate by a single vote.\n\nRichard Nixon was destroyed by Watergate. While the House did not formally impeach, Nixon knew he would be convicted by the Senate and resigned in August 1974. Nixon was the first and only president to do so. His replacement Gerald Ford was not re-elected in 1976.\n\nBill Clinton was charged with lying under oath and obstructing justice in 1999 over an affair with a White House intern. The vote to acquit was not even close. And Clinton's popularity soared.\n\nEnter Donald Trump. The trajectory of American politics has been tumbling in the wrong direction where polarization and division are endemic. Trump is loved or hated. The in-between region is largely unpopulated. The now infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is the cause celebre for Democrats who believe it is a smoking howitzer proving Trump abused power by threatening to withhold military aid in order to solicit foreign assistance in uncovering damaging information on former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nRELATED Trump asked Australian PM to investigate origins of Mueller's Russia probe\n\nRepublicans, so far, strongly disagree, leaping on the absence of a specific \quid pro quo\"" and arguing that the president was referring to information on interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The House Intelligence Committee, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has been assigned the lead in beginning this impeachment inquiry. Later this week, a number of witnesses will testify and at some stage so will the \""whistle-blower.\""\n\nWhat can possibly go wrong? Along with every major newspaper in the country that has chastised the Trump presidency for its failings on one issue or another, I have been highly critical. The foreign policy decisions to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord; the Transpacific Partnership; the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action; to start a tariff war with ENTITY; and the general disregard of allies in favor of autocrats have been disastrous for this nation and for global security. America is far less safe and secure than it was three years ago.\n\nUnfortunately, incompetence or blunders do not constitute \""high crimes and misdemeanors.\"" If they did, George W. Bush surely would have been dismissed over Iraq and Lyndon Johnson charged over Vietnam. Instead, Bush was re-elected and Johnson declined to run.\n\nRELATED House subpoenas Rudy Giuliani for Ukraine documents in impeachment probe\n\nSchiff is hyper-partisan. Rest assured, his investigation will likely uncover evidence of presidential wrongdoing. It may well be that Trump's Watergate could prove to be his civilian attorney Rudy Giuliani, whose interference in Ukraine on behalf of his client may have broken the law much as former Trump campaign adviser Paul Manafort did in different circumstances. Or the \""whistle-blower's\"" well-referenced complaint may be the grounds for abuse or obstruction. The question is whether any of these charges rise to the level of \""treason, bribery or high crimes and misdemeanors.\""\n\nRegardless of Schiff's findings and assuming the House votes to impeach, which it may not, will the Senate convict? The record is 0 for 2. Or will the charges be so compelling that Trump, like Nixon, is forced to resign? Those who know the president think not.\n\nThe House, meaning Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., may decide that rather than impeachment, censuring will have greater impact in the 2020 election to discredit the president. But as with the Mueller report that brought no charges, Trump will declare a victory if the House fails to impeach.\n\nRELATED Rep. Adam Schiff: Trump whistle-blower agrees to testify in Congress\n\nSuppose, however, that the inquiry proves beyond any reasonable doubt presidential wrongdoing and misconduct and that for some reason, no matter how unlikely, the Senate convicts. Trump is removed from office and Mike Pence replaces him. Would that prevent Trump from running again in 2020? Who knows?\n\nA nation divided against itself cannot stand. One hundred and sixty years ago, Abraham Lincoln correctly predicted civil war. Fortunately, America is not as divided today as it was in 1861. But the partisanship and outright hatred displayed by both parties toward the other, intensified by a president who believes he can determine and interpret the law to fit his needs, suggest that as with Brexit in the United Kingdom, no good outcome from the inquiry is possible.\n\nTough cases reportedly make for bad law. How these impeachment hearings evolve is unpredictable, possibly in the extreme.

China,0,"(Adds details on US special representative visit to Pakistan)\n\nKABUL/ISLAMABAD, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Afghan Taliban officials were due in Pakistan on Wednesday, the insurgent group said, as the top U.S. diplomat involved in talks with the militants also met government officials there, although it was not known if the Taliban and U.S. official would meet.\n\nThe Taliban delegation led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, one of the group's founders, was due to discuss \""important issues\"" with Pakistani officials in the capital, Islamabad, Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said on Twitter.\n\nThe Taliban visit, the latest stop on a tour of regional powers, comes after efforts by the militants and the United States to reach a deal allowing for the withdrawal of U.S.-led foreign forces broke down last month.\n\nThe top U.S. negotiator in the talks, Special Representative for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad, met Pakistani counterparts in Islamabad this week, following discussions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan in the United States the previous week.\n\n\""These consultations follow discussions held between the United States and Pakistan during the United Nations General Assembly in New York last week,\"" said a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad via email.\n\nThe spokesman did not say if Khalilzad was still in Pakistan on Wednesday or if he planned to meet the Taliban officials.\n\nThe United States has long considered Pakistani cooperation as crucial to efforts to end war in Afghanistan.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump last month halted the talks with the Taliban aimed at striking a deal allowing U.S. and other foreign troops to withdraw in exchange for Taliban security guarantees, following the death of a U.S. solder and 11 others in a Taliban bomb attack in Kabul.\n\nThe Taliban delegation would inform Pakistan's leadership of the factors that derailed the talks, said a Taliban official, who declined to be identified.\n\nThe U.S. and Taliban said last month, shortly before talks broke off, that they were close to reaching a deal, despite concern among some U.S. security officials and within the Afghan government that a U.S. withdrawal could plunge the country into even more conflict and open the way for a resurgence of Islamist militant factions.\n\nThe Taliban also planned to follow up on Khan's recent comments, that he would try to convince Trump to resume the talks, the Taliban official said.\n\nA government source in Pakistan who declined to be identified told Reuters the Taliban would arrive on Wednesday evening and meet Khan.\n\nSediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said on Twitter that the Afghan government should be involved in any peace process.\n\n\""No progress will be imminent if a peace process is not owned and led by the Afghan government,\"" he said.\n\nThe Taliban have refused to negotiate with the Afghan government, dismissing it as a U.S. puppet.\n\nTaliban officials have in recent days visited Russia, ENTITY and Iran.\n\nPakistan supported the Taliban from the group's founding in the midst of Afghanistan's civil war in the early 1990s.\n\nThe United States and the U.S.-backed Afghan government have for years suspected Pakistan has maintained its support for the militants, as a tool to block the spread of Indian influence in Afghanistan, despite Pakistani denials.\n\n(Reporting by Jibran Ahmed in Peshawar, Pakistan and Abdul Qadir Sediqi and Orooj Hakimi in Kabul and Charlotte Greenfield and Asif Shahzad in Islamabad Writing by Rod Nickel in Kabul and Charlotte Greenfield in Islamabad Editing by Robert Birsel)"
China,0,"The US economy's growth rate is losing speed, prompting questions over how slow it can go and still avoid crashing into a recession.\n\nWhereas expansion below two percent used to almost guarantee the economy would subsequently contract, some economists now reckon the US can wobble around one percent-1.5 percent without falling over, Bloomberg wrote.\n\nThe decline in the economy's so-called stall speed is a relief after data signaled the weakest manufacturing sector in a decade. It still leaves the Federal Reserve under pressure to cut interest rates and President Donald Trump facing challenges heading into next year's election.\n\nWhether the longest expansion in history remains intact may ultimately depend on whether consumers are able to maintain spending enough to offset the slump in manufacturing amid the US-ENTITY trade war.\n\n\Suddenly the idea of stall speed is much more important today than it has been for most of the expansion,\"" said Stephen Gallagher, chief US economist at Societe Generale SA. \""The economy is running on one engine, and that's the consumer.\""\n\nAt Commerzbank AG, currency strategist Ulrich Leuchtmann told clients in a report on Wednesday that \""the fact that stall speed is becoming an issue of common interest\"" may undermine demand for US assets.\n\nTaking a page from aviation, in which the stall speed is the slowest a plane can fly while still maintaining a level flight, the economic equivalent is the point at which growth is no longer self-sustaining.\n\nThat happens when consumers and companies pull back in the face of the lackluster economic performance.\n\n\""When economic actors become sufficiently concerned whether justified or not -- a mild slowdown can easily become worse,\"" Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management Inc., wrote in a report last month.\n\nThe outlook for growth has indeed softened, with the manufacturing sector already slipping into a recession during the first half of the year, capital investment weakening and job gains moderating. Analysts expect growth in gross domestic product to slow to 1.7 percent next year.\n\nIn expansions dating back to the 1940s, real GDP growth below two percent was almost always followed by a recession, according to Lascelles. Now, he and other economists expect the economy can avoid buckling at that pace.\n\nA reduced stall speed means growth can be slower and monthly payroll gains can be softer and still sustain the expansion.\n\nThe stall speed has largely declined because the potential growth rate of the economy has slowed.\n\nThe two concepts are closely tied. Potential growth is the pace at which the economy can expand without inflation heating up. Right now, the Fed sees potential growth at 1.9 percent. Predictions by the Congressional Budget Office for the rate have also come down over time. It's eased amid demographic changes like slower population growth and softer productivity gains.\n\n\""The problem here is if potential growth is slowing, what constitutes a rapid expansion today is very different than what it looked like maybe 40 years ago,\"" said Michael Gapen, chief US economist at Barclays Plc.\n\nAnd the expansion has been lackluster. Since the end of the recession in 2009, GDP has increased about half as much on a percentage basis as it did during the 1991-2001 expansion, the nation's second-longest. Wage growth has remained subdued and inflation has repeatedly missed the Fed's two percent target.\n\n\""We expect stall speed for the economy to be in the vicinity of 1.4-1.5 percent real GDP growth (in year-on-year terms). Below that, household income creation slows to such a pace that consumers are unable to shoulder the growth burden.\""\n\nMost economists predict the economy can stay above their self-defined stall speed level next year, but Joachim Fels and Andrew Balls of Pacific Investment Management Co. expect growth to slow to about 1 percent in the first half of 2020.\n\n\""While a recession is not our base case, it doesn't take much to tip over an economy that is moving along at stall speed,\"" Fels and Balls wrote in the report last week.\n\nWhile a slower stall speed means the economy can expand at a more subdued pace without signaling imminent recession, the bad news is that it doesn't mean the US is less exposed to a downturn.\n\nLower potential growth \""tells you that a shock that we may have experienced before the crisis which may not have tipped you into recession could certainly do so now,\"" said Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank AG.\n\nAs economic growth withers, fiscal and monetary stimulus, provided that they are employed in a timely fashion, can give the economy much-needed lift. But policy makers at the Fed and in Congress have less room to keep the nation from hitting stall speed -- or possibly accelerating out of it.\n\n\""It raises the risk of the end of the economic cycle,\"" Gapen said. \""We've done what we can do on the fiscal side. There's limited space for monetary policy to react."
China,0,"Global economic growth is expected to hit an eight-year low of 2.5 percent next year, according to ratings agency Fitch, abc.net.au wrote.\n\n\The outlook for the global economy has deteriorated significantly due to the escalation in the US-ENTITY trade war,\"" the agency wrote in its Global Economic Outlook, released on Wednesday.\n\nIn the past 15 months, the world's two biggest economies have levied hundreds of billions of dollars in tit-for-tat tariffs on each other's imports, which is having a major impact on factory activity in several countries.\n\nThe United States has recorded its worst manufacturing result in 10 years, while the eurozone economies have contracted to a seven-year low.\n\nWith lingering trade tensions weighing on manufacturing and exports, the US and EU data mirrored similar downbeat patterns in the eurozone, Japan, the United Kingdom and ENTITY.\n\n\""World growth has not been as low as 2.5 percent since 2012, a year that saw the eurozone sovereign debt crisis in full swing and a marked slowdown in ENTITY,\"" wrote Brian Coulton, Fitch's chief economist and the report's lead author.\n\nThe Australian economy has been growing for 28 consecutive years, but there are troubling signs, and the future is difficult to see, wrote Josh Gordon.\n\nIn comparison, Fitch is expecting world GDP growth to be 2.6 percent this year -- which is a significant drop from last year's 3.2 percent.\n\nSimilar views were echoed by Rabobank's head of global economics Jan Lambregts, who is predicting a \""modest\"" global recession to happen in 2020-2021, \""using the 'old' IMF definition of global GDP growth coming in below three percent\"".\n\n\""At the heart of the slowdown is a downturn in global manufacturing that's already visible in Asia, spilling over into Europe and eventually set to hit the United States,\"" he said.\n\n\""A full decade after the global financial crisis, it's tempting to think we are both better able to avert any financial crisis and better prepared to deal with one should it still happen.\n\n\""But whether that's truly the case remains to be seen.\""\n\nLast month, Australia's economy slowed to its most sluggish pace in a decade with annualized GDP growth of 1.4 percent, well below the Reserve Bank's forecasts.\n\nThe RBA, meanwhile, cut Australia's official cash rate to a record low 0.75 percent on Tuesday in an attempt to stimulate the flagging economy.\n\nThe Conversation's 2019-20 forecasting panel is predicting an economic growth rate as weak as any since the GFC.\n\nFitch, however, expects the domestic economy to pick up slightly and expand by a \""lackluster\"" 1.7 percent by the end of 2019.\n\n\""However, a downgrade to our ENTITY growth forecast and a more challenging outlook for commodity prices have prompted a modest cut to our 2020 and 2021 growth forecasts,\"" Fitch said.\n\nThe ratings agency expects a further pickup in Australian GDP growth next year (+2.3pc) and in 2021 (+2.4pc). But those predictions are still a modest downgrade (-0.1pc) compared to its previous estimates."
China,0,"Marine Corps Pfc. Grady J. Crawford returned home Friday, nearly 70 years after his mother received a telegram saying he'd gone missing on a frozen battlefield in the Korean War, thousands of miles from where he'd grown up in Dallas.\n\nHis arrival begins a long-delayed homecoming celebration for Grady's family and a day of reflection for a lost son of the city who died in a bleak and distant war.\n\nAt 2:17 p.m., Friday, a flag-draped casket carrying the remains of the Marine killed in the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir, one of the most historic in Corps history, arrived at DFW Airport on a Delta Air Lines plane traveling from Los Angeles. The casket was flown overnight from Honolulu to Los Angeles.\n\nGrady's surviving relatives, including his sister-in-law and four nieces, met the flight Friday afternoon on the tarmac. As they stood nearby, an honor guard of seven Marines in dress uniforms received Grady's casket and escorted it to a hearse.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon the family will honor Grady, a Woodrow Wilson High School graduate, with a service and burial open to the public at Restland Funeral Home.\n\nAmong those at DFW Airport Friday was Crawford's niece, Colleen O'Quinn Crawford. Her late father, Bill, was Grady's younger brother and a fellow Korean War veteran.\n\n\It's just -- it's beautiful,\"" Colleen said in a halting voice. \""It's like Halley's Comet. You never think that's going to happen in your lifetime. But it's happened. It's very profound,\"" she said.\n\nBorn December 16, 1928, Grady Crawford was the oldest of two boys.\n\nThe Crawfords lived in the Lakewood neighborhood of Dallas. Grady lettered in football and was active in boxing and swimming. But his passion was Junior ROTC, where he achieved sharpshooter and marksman medals, according to the 1947 high school yearbook.\n\n\""We heard growing up what a little warrior he was,\"" Colleen said.\n\nAfter graduating in 1947, he enlisted in the Marines. A few years later, his brother, Bill, joined the Merchant Marines and was also a Korean War veteran.\n\nThe year before Grady arrived in Korea, tragedy struck the family back home. Grady's father, Walter Grady Crawford, died Nov. 5, 1949, from injuries sustained after a city bus struck him near the intersection of Gaston Avenue and Dumas Street in Old East Dallas.\n\nThe elder Crawford, who was 54, stumbled after getting off the bus and fell under its rear wheels as the bus pulled away from the curb, according to a front-page article in The News.\n\n\""It was crazy,\"" said Colleen. \""They lost their father in a freak accident.\""\n\nThe conflict in Korea, which began in June of 1950, was overshadowed by World War II, which preceded it, and the Vietnam War, which came after.\n\nThe late author David Halberstam called it a war \""orphaned by history.\""\n\n\""It has been referred to as the 'forgotten war,' but not by those who fought the war. They don't forget,\"" said Hal Barker, a Korean War historian from Dallas who operates the Korean War Project website with his brother Ted, also from Dallas.\n\nGrady fought in the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir, one of the most historic of the Korean War. The battle is one that has come to define the legacy of the Marine Corps, the details of which are shared with every Marine recruit going through boot camp.\n\nThe brutal, 17-day battle took place in sub-zero temperatures and involved a U.S. force of 12,000 Marines and about 3,000 soldiers surrounded by the enemy.\n\nThe 1st Marine Division had taken up positions in the craggy and rugged region of North Korea on the west side of the Chosin reservoir with the Army set up on the east side. The plan was to drive the North Korean Army north toward ENTITY.\n\nBut on Nov. 27, an overwhelming force of 120,000 Chinese troops, allied with the North Koreans, launched a surprise attack on the Americans. The intense battles mostly took place at night with the Chinese soldiers attacking in waves, according to accounts by the military and historians.\n\nThe soldiers on the east side of the reservoir were nearly wiped out in a slaughter. On the west side of the reservoir, the 1st Marine Division was looking at the same fate.\n\nFaced with annihilation or a mass surrender, the Marines chose neither, deciding instead to fight their way through the Chinese troops and escape to the south.\n\nThe conditions couldn't have been worse. Temperatures had plunged to 25 degrees below zero, causing rampant frostbite. The bitter cold caused weapons to jam. The Marines ran short of ammunition and food.\n\nAssembled around the town of Yudam-ni, the Marines had only one way out, a one-lane road leading south to Hagaru-ri. \""December 1st, the Marines started their breakout from Yudam-ni,\"" said Barker, the Dallas-based Korean War historian.\n\nChinese forces attacked the Marines in the hills surrounding Yudam-ni. The Marines fought their way south through the Toktong Pass, finally reaching safety after three days. But the Marines had suffered 1,500 casualties.\n\nGrady Crawford was among them.\n\nOnly 21 at the time, Grady was part of the 4th Battalion, 11th Marine Regiment of the 1st Marine Division. Assigned to an artillery unit, his mission on Dec. 1 was to provide cover as other Marines evacuated. Grady was last seen that day in the town of Yudam-ni, and the Marines officially listed him as missing.\n\nGrady's brother, Bill, who served in the Merchant Marines during the war, often told his daughters that Grady's best friend in the Marines told him he last saw Grady running over a hill, and \""when he looked again, Grady was gone,\"" Colleen said.\n\nA Marine liaison to the Crawford family described the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir as \""a victorious retreat,\"" Colleen said.\n\nGrady's gung-ho patriotism was \""very typical,\"" of those who enlisted in the Marines in those days, Barker said. \""We've had several of our friends from Woodrow Wilson High School who joined the Marines.\""\n\nAnother Korean War Marine veteran grew up three or four blocks from Grady, Barker said. \""They were drawn to the military and the Marine Corps was the unit if you really wanted to fight.\""\n\nOther than a telegram notifying them that Grady was missing, the Crawfords knew virtually nothing about what happened to him. \""The family members of the missing don't know anything, which is 100 percent typical,\"" Barker said.\n\nAs it turned out, Grady's remains were among those returned to U.S. custody about a year after the 1953 ceasefire. In September of 1954, as part of an exchange of war dead called Operation Glory, the North Korean government returned to United States custody over 4,000 sets of remains recovered from an isolated burial site on the west side of the Chosin Reservoir, Barker said.\n\n\""It was heartbreaking,\"" Colleen Crawford said. \""He's been here the whole time in Hawaii and we didn't know.\""\n\nThe technology for identifying remains is advancing every year, but it's still a long, arduous process, she said. \""The process is starting to speed up, so there's hope for others that it won't take as long.\""\n\nMany of the returned remains could not be identified at the time and were buried as unknowns at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, located at the Punchbowl Crater in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\nIn 2012, some of these unknown remains were exhumed for reexamination. They included a set of remains identified only as X-14896. Those remains proved to be Grady's.\n\nAdvances in forensic techniques allowed scientists with the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) to identify Grady. His remains consisted of a nearly complete skeleton, which is considered highly unusual, the family was told. To identify Crawford's remains, DPAA scientists used dental, anthropological and skull analysis, as well as circumstantial and material evidence, according to a Pentagon news release.\n\nMore than 7,000 American service members remain missing from the Korean war, with most believed to have been last seen in North Korea, Barker said. Families would simply get a telegram informing them their son or brother was missing, Barker said.\n\n\""We've got hundreds of these stories, he said. \""The notification would come and the mother would drop dead or go into severe depression,\"" he said.\n\nThe Crawfords had no clue what was coming.\n\nOn July 15 of this year, the Marines tracked down the Crawfords to Peru, Indiana, where Colleen, who was born and raised in Dallas, and her mother, were now living.\n\nWhen Colleen answered the phone that Monday, a Marine liaison told her that her Uncle Grady had been identified. \""My mom was standing next to me. I had to pick my jaw off the ground,\"" Colleen said. \""And then I handed the phone to my mom.\""\n\nColleen's mom, Nancy Crawford Dice, who was Grady's sister-in-law, was equally flabbergasted. \""After 70 years, to get this call. It was so off-the-wall,\"" Nancy Crawford Dice said.\n\nAfter arriving in Dallas, Colleen tried to compose herself while explaining to a reporter the events since that call from the Marines.\n\n\""It's beautiful. We are overwhelmed with joy for a beautiful closure. There's so much to love about Grady -- his service and his passion to serve his country. He was a warrior.\""\n\nAt DFW Airport Friday, Colleen was joined by a small group that included her mother and her three sisters, all nieces of Grady's: Christi Crawford and Teri Moore, of Peru, Indiana, and Alicia Burrough, of Mountainburg, Arkansas.\n\nVisitation will take place Saturday from 2-4 p.m. at the Memorial Chapel at Restland Funeral Home at 13005 Greenville Ave., Dallas. Grady will be buried at 4 p.m. at the Restland cemetery near the grave of his younger brother, Bill.\n\nBarbara Adamson, co-founder of the Woodrow Wilson High School alumni association, said she invited the school to ask current Junior ROTC students to attend the funeral. Adamson said she's also planning to honor Grady at the school's 90th anniversary celebration October 26th.\n\nAt the airport, under warm and sunny skies, the Crawford sisters and their mom gathered at the back of the hearse after the Marines put Grady's casket inside. As they embraced, each one took a moment to press a hand on the casket.\n\n\""He's home,\"" Christi Crawford said, wiping tears from her eyes with a tissue. \""He's home"
