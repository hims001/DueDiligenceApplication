SOYLU Suleyman,0,"The House voted 405-11 on a resolution in favor of both recognizing and condemning the Ottoman Empire's killing of approximately 1.5 million Armenians from 1915 to 1923, an event that the Turkish government has historically denied and argued accusations about which did not take into account the deaths of Turks.\n\n\Many American politicians, diplomats and institutions have rightly recognized these atrocities as a genocide, including America's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire at the time, Henry Morgenthau, and Ronald Reagan,\"" House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY) said on the floor prior to the vote, according to The Hill.\n\nHe went on to assert that \""only by shining a light on the darkest parts of our history can we learn not to repeat them\"".\n\nThe bill's three main points declare the US will commemorate the Armenian genocide, reject \""efforts to enlist, engage\"" or associate in the denial of the genocide and work to educate the public on details surrounding the atrocity.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu fired back at the US lawmakers' backing of the resolution and accused them of \""exploiting history in politics\"".\n\nThe World War I-era genocide has been recognized by Russia, several European Union states and the World Council of Churches. Earlier this year, French President Emmanuel Macron moved to declare April 24 as the country's Day of Armenian Genocide Remembrance.\n\nIn another Tuesday bipartisan showing, the House, by a 403-16 vote, passed a resolution in favor of sanctions against Turkey over its Operation Peace Spring in Northern Syria. The bill, entitled \""Protect Against Conflict by Turkey Act\"", received overwhelming support from the Republican Party, with 176 GOP lawmakers voting in support and only 15 opposed.\n\n\""Rather than hold Turkey accountable for how they've conducted this bloody campaign, [US President Donald] Trump has given them a free pass,\"" Engel stated on Tuesday, as reported by The Hill.\n\n\""When the head of [ISIL, ISIS or Daesh] was finally killed, President Trump unfortunately thanked the Turks, thanked the Turkish government. That just doesn't sit right with me,\"" he added.\n\nCavusoglu also issued a statement in response to the House's move to impose sanctions on Ankara and claimed the measure went against the October 17 ceasefire deal brokered between the US and Turkey. The foreign minister went on to urge other Washington lawmakers to halt sanction efforts altogether and avoid a breakdown in bilateral ties.\n\n\""America is holding accountable top Turkish officials responsible for human rights abuses, including attacking our Kurdish partners,\"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi noted, reported USA Today.\n\n\""We're penalizing Turkish financial institutions who perpetuate President [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan's corruption and abuses,\"" she stated.\n\nSenator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) echoed the speaker's comments on Ankara and called on the US Senate to act with haste and advance the bill.\n\nThe bipartisan bill now moves on to the Senate; however, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has previously warned Congress to \""think extremely carefully\"" about rushing to sanction a NATO ally.\n\nWashington's previous sanctions on Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, Energy Minister Fatih Donmez and Interior Minister ENTITY were lifted by Trump last week after Ankara agreed to make the Northern Syria ceasefire permanent. The US president noted at the time that sanctions would be reinstated if Turkey did not honor their word and adhere to ceasefire obligations."
SOYLU Suleyman,1,"Statements of Administration officials suggest that additional U.S. sanctions measures against Turkey, as well as possible further general and specific licenses, are being contemplated.\n\nOn October 14, 2019, the Trump administration issued a new executive order that authorizes the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to designate on OFAC's list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (\""SDN List\"") Turkish officials and government entities and others that have engaged in actions resulting in serious human rights abuses in Syria or that threaten the peace, security, stability or territorial integrity of Syria.\n\nOFAC's first exercise of authority under this new executive order was the designation of two Turkish ministries (the Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and the Ministry of National Defence) and three Turkish ministers on the SDN List. As a result, U.S. persons are now broadly prohibited from dealing with these persons absent a license issued by OFAC and must block their property if it comes into the possession or control of U.S. persons. In addition, non-U.S. persons may be exposed to secondary sanctions for dealing with these parties. Concurrently, OFAC issued three general licenses that authorize certain transactions that would otherwise be prohibited under U.S. sanctions, including a 30-day period to wind-down certain existing business.\n\nThis client alert provides an overview of these recent measures and the possibility of additional sanctions measures that may be imposed against Turkey by the United States.\n\nThe new Executive Order signed on October 14, 2019, authorizes OFAC to designate on the SDN List: (1) current or former officials of the government of Turkey; (2) subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities of the government of Turkey; (3) persons operating in certain sectors of the Turkish economy to be specified by the U.S. government; and (4) other persons deemed to have threatened the peace, security, stability or territorial integrity of Syria or committed serious human rights abuses in Syria.\n\nThe Executive Order also provides the U.S. State Department and OFAC authority to impose secondary sanctions from a menu of options on other foreign persons determined to have engaged in other activities contributing to instability in Syria. These \""menu-based\"" sanctions include government procurement restrictions; visa restrictions; loan, banking and foreign exchange restrictions; SDN designations; investment restrictions; import prohibitions; and measures aimed at corporate officers.\n\nThe Executive Order also provides secondary sanctions authorities that allow the U.S. government to designate as SDNs persons who materially assist, sponsor or provide financial, material or technology support for, or goods or services to or in support of, SDNs and blocked persons under this Executive Order. Additionally, foreign financial institutions that knowingly facilitate significant transactions on behalf of SDNs or blocked persons could be subject to sanctions that restrict their access to U.S. correspondent or payable through accounts.\n\nPursuant to the authority granted under the new executive order, OFAC designated on the SDN List Turkey's Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and Ministry of National Defence. Additionally, OFAC designated the following three individual ministers of the Republic of Turkey as SDNs: (1) Hulusi Akar, the Minister of National Defence; (2) ENTITY, the Minister of Interior; and (3) Fatih Donmez, the Minister of Energy.\n\nAs a result of these actions, U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any business, transactions, contracts or other dealings with these Turkish ministries and ministers, as well as entities that they own 50 percent or more, unless authorized by OFAC by a general or specific license. Additionally, property or property interests of these ministries, ministers and entities owned 50 percent or more by them must be blocked if they come into the possession or control of a U.S. person.\n\nRecognizing the potential ramifications that these actions will likely have on Turkey's energy sector and U.S. companies doing business in this sector, OFAC noted in its press release that \""it is prepared to issue authorizations, such as general or specific licenses, as appropriate, to ensure that the new designations do not disrupt Turkey's ability to meet its energy needs.\""\n\nOFAC also issued three General Licenses that authorize certain transactions that would otherwise be prohibited under U.S. sanctions.\n\nOf particular importance, OFAC issued a 30-day \""Wind Down\"" General License (General License 2), which authorizes U.S. persons to engage in transactions and activities \""that are ordinarily incident and necessary to the wind down of operations, contracts, or other agreements involving the Ministry of National Defence or the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources . . . or any entity in which one or more of such ministries own, directly or indirectly, a 50 percent or greater interest,\"" provided such operations, contracts or agreements were in effect prior to October 14, 2019. This General License expires on November 13, 2019, meaning that U.S. persons must generally wind down their pre-sanctions operations, contracts and agreements with these ministries by that date.\n\nOFAC also issued General License 1, which authorizes U.S. persons to engage in transactions and activities otherwise prohibited by these sanctions \""that are for the conduct of the official business of the United States Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.\"" For example, this general license authorizes U.S. companies to engage in contracts with the U.S. government for official U.S. government business related to the Ministry of National Defence and Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, but it does not authorize sales of goods or services (including dual-use or military items) to such ministries that are not related to official U.S. government business, even if such sales are authorized under an export license issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce or U.S. Department of State.\n\nFurthermore, OFAC issued General License 3, which authorizes transactions and activities involving the Ministry of National Defence or the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (including entities owned 50 percent or more by such ministries) that are for the official business of the United Nations, its specialized agencies, and related organizations.\n\nSecretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin stated that although these sanctions are \""starting small,\"" they could become a \""maximum pressure\"" campaign that could \""destroy the Turkish economy.\"" It appears that additional sanctions measures may be under preparation at this time for possible implementation in the near future. In addition, several pending bills in Congress would, if enacted, mandate additional sanctions against Turkey. These pending bills continue to have bipartisan support, although it remains to be seen what effect the October 14 sanctions will have on Congressional consideration and further action on these bills.\n\nWith uncertainty on the ground in Syria and Turkey, additional pending sanction legislation, and continuing conflict between the Trump administration and Congress regarding the administration's recent actions associated with Turkey and Syria, the course and further development of this very new U.S. sanctions program remains unpredictable and may continue to quickly evolve."
NILETEL,1,"Global Magnitsky designations target government insiders engaging in bribery, kickbacks, and procurement fraud while draining state coffers\n\nWashington - Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Ashraf Seed Ahmed Al-Cardinal (Al-Cardinal) and Kur Ajing Ater (Ajing) for their involvement in bribery, kickbacks and procurement fraud with senior government officials. OFAC is also designating five companies determined to be owned or controlled by Al-Cardinal, and one company owned or controlled by Ajing. OFAC designated these individuals and entities pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13818, which builds upon and implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and targets perpetrators of serious human rights abuse and corruption.\n\n'These South Sudanese elites and corrupt government officials have drained state coffers and usurped the country's resources with impunity. Al-Cardinal and Ajing leverage their businesses and political connections to engage in corruption at great expense to the South Sudanese people,' said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. 'The South Sudanese government must take urgent measures to increase transparency and enforce accountability against those involved in systemic corruption. Privileged elites should not be allowed to profit from conflict as they undermine efforts to bring lasting peace to South Sudan.'\n\nAs a result of today's action, all property and interests in property of the individuals and entities named below, and of any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by them, individually, or with other designated persons, that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons, are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC or otherwise exempt, OFAC's regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. In addition, any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a U.S. person, wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited by E.O. 13818 if performed by a U.S. person or within the United States would be prohibited.\n\nASHRAF SEED AHMED AL-CARDINAL\n\nSudanese businessman Al-Cardinal has been used by a senior South Sudanese government official as an intermediary to deposit and hold a large amount of funds in a country outside of South Sudan. Following OFAC's designation of Benjamin Bol Mel in December 2017, the senior South Sudanese official began to use a bank account in the name of one of Al-Cardinal's companies to store his personal funds in an attempt to avoid the effects of potential sanctions designations. Further, in early 2019, the South Sudanese government made millions of dollars in payments to a company owned by Al-Cardinal; while the official reason was for the payment for food, the money instead went to senior South Sudanese government officials. Other South Sudanese government officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the massive corruption in the South Sudanese government, noting that although large amounts of money were paid to Al-Cardinal for supplies and provisions, government forces never seemed to be adequately supplied.\n\nSeparately, a company partially owned by Al-Cardinal has been publicly implicated in the importation of amphibious armored vehicles into South Sudan that gave the Government of South Sudan the ability to extend offensives that included violent attacks on innocent civilians.\n\nFive companies owned or controlled by Al-Cardinal were also designated today: Alcardinal General Trading Limited, Alcardinal General Trading LLC, Al Cardinal Investments Co. LTD, Alcardinal Petroleum Company limited, and ENTITY.\n\nAl-Cardinal is being designated for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery.\n\nKUR AJING ATER\n\nAjing is a South Sudanese businessman who has bribed key officials in the Government of South Sudan in order to maintain influence and access to the South Sudanese oil market. Ajing used these bribes to both curry favor with a senior gatekeeper within the Government of South Sudan and to ensure the silence and compliance of a key government officials. In late 2018, the South Sudanese government made a large cash payment to Ajing. While the official reason was for the payment of food, the money instead went directly to a senior South Sudanese government official. In addition, Ajing has been obligated large amounts of oil by the Government of South Sudan, and has given money and vehicles to government officials in return. Ajing has claimed to have paid senior officials millions of dollars and has cooperated with the request of a senior official to route oil payments in cash rather than through official bank accounts. Further, Ajing was the recipient of a multi-year contract to purchase food for the South Sudanese military, and in return, paid a percentage of the contract back to a senior South Sudanese government official. According to public media reports, Ajing received millions of dollars in contracts for the South Sudanese military, including one contract that alone exceeds the total amount budgeted for the military's goods and services for the year by a factor of ten.\n\nAjing is being designated for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, an entity that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery. One company owned or controlled by Ajing was also designated today: Lou Trading and Investment Company Limited.\n\nGLOBAL MAGNITSKY\n\nBuilding upon the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, on December 20, 2017, the President signed E.O. 13818, in which the President found that the prevalence of human rights abuse and corruption which have their source, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States, had reached such scope and gravity that it threatens the stability of international political and economic systems. Human rights abuse and corruption undermine the values that form an essential foundation of stable, secure, and functioning societies; have devastating impacts on individuals; weaken democratic institutions; degrade the rule of law; perpetuate violent conflicts; facilitate the activities of dangerous persons; and undermine economic markets. The United States seeks to impose tangible and significant consequences on those who commit serious human rights abuse or engage in corruption, as well as to protect the financial system of the United States from abuse by these same persons.\n\nTo date, the Department of the Treasury has designated 122 individuals and entities under E.O. 13818. This figure is in addition to the numerous human rights or corruption related designations Treasury has issued under other various authorities. In total, since January of 2017, Treasury has taken action against more than 680 individuals and entities with links to human rights abuse or corruption.\n\nFor more information on the individuals and entities designated today, click here.\n\n####\n\nAttachments\n\nOriginal document Permalink\n\nDisclaimer\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury published this content on 11 October 2019 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

Cosco Shipping Tanker,1,"""Oil traders now have about two months to wind down operations with China's sanctions-hit ENTITY, according to a license issued Thursday by the US Treasury Department.\n\nThe September 25 sanctions against two ENTITY affiliates rocked the VLCC market, driving up freight rates as traders that had booked ENTITY tankers immediately dropped those charters and scrambled to secure alternate tonnage.\n\nTreasury's license says companies must wind down existing deals by December 20. The leeway does not apply to ENTITY's other sanctioned affiliate, ENTITY Seaman and Ship Management.\n\nENTITY controls more than 5% of the global VLCC fleet, but fewer than half its ships were sanctioned. VLCC freight rates have fallen sharply since the initial post-sanctions spike, as charterers booked different ships and the market digested which Costco vessels were off limits.\n\nThe cost of booking a VLCC sailing out of the US Gulf Coast has tanked more than 45% since October 14, when freight reached a peak of $21 million for ships discharging in China, coming under pressure as the industry continues to adjusts to new market norms and charterers work to drive prices lower.\n\nS&P Global Platts was last hearing VLCC freight rates talked for the USGC-China route around $11.5 million Thursday morning, steady from Wednesday's assessment.\n\nDespite the sharp drop in rates over the past two weeks, freight remains above the lump sum $9.5 million seen September 27, which at that point was the highest mark since Platts began assessing the USGC-China route in March 2018.\n\nThe US leveled sanctions against the ENTITY affiliates for continuing to trade oil with Iran, Treasury said September 25.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the companies \""knowingly transported oil from Iran contrary to United States sanctions. We're telling China and all nations: know that we will sanction every violation of sanctionable activity.\""\n\nSource:"
Cosco Shipping Tanker,0,"""This suggests that the fluctuation in oil purchases is not related to a system-wide disruption in China-Iran trade such as the banking difficulties that stymied commerce late last year. Additionally, Chinese exports to Iran did not decline month-on-month in September.\n\nAccording to data provided by TankerTrackers.com, fewer barrels of oil were observed departing Iran in August than in July. Observed exports amounted to around 670,000 bpd in August, down by about 130,000 bpd from the previous month. This drop in observed exports offers one explanation as to why Chinese declared imports of Iranian oil were lower in September than in August -- export levels in a given month tend to appear as declared imports in the following month given the four week journey of tankers at sea.\n\nNotably, any decision to scale back imports of Iranian oil in September would have predated the Trump administration's move to sanction tanker subsidiaries of Chinese state shipping giant ENTITY involved in the transport of Iranian oil. The Chinese government has reportedly asked the Trump administration to remove sanctions on ENTITY as part of its ongoing trade negotiations.\n\nIn July, U.S. officials had publicly expressed concern about continued Chinese purchases of Iranian oil, suggesting that China was given prior warning that its tanker fleet could be targeted with sanctions designations. This may have spurred China to reduce the use of its own VLCC tankers in the transport of Iranian oil. The fleet of the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) has long been the primary means by which Iranian oil is exported to China, but having fewer Chinese tankers picking up oil from terminals in Iran would nonetheless reduce export capacity, depressing overall imports.\n\nHowever, data on observed exports from Iran does not correspond to the drop in declared imports in September's customs data. The value of the observed exports is considerably higher than the USD 250 million in Chinese purchases declared for September. The market value of Iran's August exports is over USD 1.2 billion. Syria is the only other customer currently purchasing Iranian oil and imports significantly less than China. So where is the additional oil going?"

Cosco Shipping Tanker,1,"Washington -- VLCC freight has fallen sharply since post-sanctions spike\n\nTreasury's wind down does not apply to second ENTITY affiliate\n\nOil traders now have about two months to wind down operations with China's sanctions-hit ENTITY, according to a license issued Thursday by the US Treasury Department.\n\nThe September 25 sanctions against two ENTITY affiliates rocked the VLCC market, driving up freight rates as traders that had booked ENTITY tankers immediately dropped those charters and scrambled to secure alternate tonnage.\n\nTreasury's license says companies must wind down existing deals by December 20. The leeway does not apply to ENTITY's other sanctioned affiliate, ENTITY Seaman and Ship Management.\n\nENTITY controls more than 5% of the global VLCC fleet, but fewer than half its ships were sanctioned. VLCC freight rates have fallen sharply since the initial post-sanctions spike, as charterers booked different ships and the market digested which Costco vessels were off limits.\n\nThe cost of booking a VLCC sailing out of the US Gulf Coast has tanked more than 45% since October 14, when freight reached a peak of $21 million for ships discharging in China, coming under pressure as the industry continues to adjusts to new market norms and charterers work to drive prices lower.\n\nS&P Global Platts was last hearing VLCC freight rates talked for the USGC-China route around $11.5 million Thursday morning, steady from Wednesday's assessment.\n\nDespite the sharp drop in rates over the past two weeks, freight remains above the lump sum $9.5 million seen September 27, which at that point was the highest mark since Platts began assessing the USGC-China route in March 2018.\n\nThe US leveled sanctions against the ENTITY affiliates for continuing to trade oil with Iran, Treasury said September 25.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the companies \knowingly transported oil from Iran contrary to United States sanctions. We're telling China and all nations: know that we will sanction every violation of sanctionable activity.\"""
Cosco Shipping Tanker,1,"Last month, the US Department of the Treasury announced the ENTITY Company and ENTITY Seaman and Ship Management Company met the requirements for new sanctions under Executive Order 13846, which reimposed sanctions with respect to Iran.\n\nUS Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, claimed the Chinese state owned shipping company had knowingly violated US restrictions on handling Iranian oil. The surprise announcement threw global shipping markets into turmoil, raised oil transport prices on the world's oceans, and negatively affected the global community by denying the freedom to engage in trade through the peaceful circulation of legitimate goods.\n\nYet the US claims to uphold the freedom of the seas as a historic right, based on the Grotian principles of free trade, which involves equitable and peaceful rights to engage in trade and circulate goods.\n\nWithout the ability for customers to utilize US financial exchange systems for US dollar transactions involving ENTITY Companies, the sanctions result in their owned and operated vessels effectively being blocked from circulating oil, a legitimate commodity on the world market.\n\nWhile there are many different grades and types of oil produced for the global market, two Western crude oils dominate. The US' WTI and UK's Brent Crude are the benchmarks for purchases of oil worldwide, traded in US dollars. As the global currency for the trade of a major energy source, the US dollar can have a dramatic effect on oil pricing, and the ability of countries to trade in the commodity.\n\nThe US is not a maritime power and holds only a small portion of the world merchant marine fleet. From its highest level at 16.9 percent in 1960 with 2,926 vessels, to approximately 0.4 percent with 182 vessels of the world's merchant vessels operating under the US flag in 2019.\n\nWhile the US Navy is the largest naval force globally, its ability to project force under freedom of navigation laws does not affect merchant trade during peacetime, and does not compensate for the miniscule US merchant fleet.\n\nChina is a large maritime power, holding the second largest merchant marine fleet behind Greece. With 7,744 vessels as of August 2018, the employment patterns of Chinese flagged or owned vessels in the \carrying trade,\"" when China is not the voyage origin or destination, is significant.\n\nTo find a comparison in US merchant marine history with China's ability to trade globally today, it is necessary to examine the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century. Outside of the unnatural trading patterns created by the late 19th century US colonial period, it has now been two centuries since the US occupied the position China holds in merchant marine shipping.\n\nWith US inability to circulate goods in the maritime realm, it is in a difficult position, as payment for other nation states to engage in the world's largest national consumer market causes capital outflow. The US has, through governmental domestic policies and those of US merchant shipping companies, been placed in a position where it can no longer be considered a maritime power.\n\nHowever, the ability to block the circulation of global currency provides an opportunity to prevent others to operate, as ENTITY (Dalian) has discovered. With the company's oil tankers being unable to engage in the world's oil trade through the unilateral actions of the US, a virtual blockade has been implemented, without the use of the US Navy.\n\nFreedom of the seas, the ability to circulate goods around the globe, has been interrupted not through force, merely though the ability of one country to interrupt the flow of financial instruments involved in transactions outside its borders.\n\nAs Hugo Grotius said, people are not to be deprived of sovereignty over their possessions due to political or religious differences, since sovereignty is a matter of positive law. It is possible to look further for advice with \""Ubi societas, ibi jus,\"" wherever there is a social structure, you will find law.\n\nThe US attempts to sanction ENTITY and prevents to company from circulating goods freely and making use of the wares and products it possesses should be considered in this light. It should not be considered with the words of US Rear Admiral John Hayes, who said in 1962; \""It does seem time that the whole idea of freedom of the seas be reviewed by the Nation and the Navy that is alone able to control the seas.\""\n\nDenial of a state's ability to enjoy the benefits of maritime power through control of financial transaction services is a naval blockade, and denial of sovereignty via other means, which can be considered as a denial of the right of a maritime power to engage in trade.\n\nAs Grotius stated over a century before the US emerged as a nation, \""It does not matter if there any differences based upon religion or political structure, all nations have the right to freely circulate goods upon the seas.\""\n\nSource:"

Chevron Corporation,1,"Once again, the left is rising in Latin America as people revolt against authoritarian regimes, many of whom were put in place by US-supported coups. These regimes have taken International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans and are under the thumb of international finance, which is against the interests of people.After the embattled President of Ecuador claimed that President Nicolas Maduro was the cause of the massive protests against him, Maduro made clear what was occurring in Latin America, saying:\n\nWe have two models: the IMF model which privatizes everything and takes away the people's rights to health, education and work; and the humanist-progressive model which is emerging in Latin America and has the Bolivarian Revolution at the forefront.\n\nMaduro's clear understanding of the conflict is why it has been so important for the US to remove him. His success in defeating ongoing US coup attempts is a model guiding Latin America to a future independent of US domination.\n\nEcuadorians celebrate the repeal of Decree 883 (From Twitter)\n\nEcuador in Rebellion Against IMF and the US Puppet Moreno\n\nOn October 4, Moreno proclaimed the end of a 40-year policy of fuel and petrol subsidies, which had traditionally benefited his country's working-class population. He also announced a 20 percent decrease in the salary of public employees and initiated plans to privatize pensions. He removed workplace and job security safeguards. Decree 883, known as 'The Package', was a series of neoliberal policies demanded by the IMF in return for a $4.2 billion dollar loan. It was preceded by policies for the wealthy including reducing their taxes.\n\nThe IMF loan was part of Moreno serving as a puppet and bowing to multiple US demands. Ecuador promised to settle a long dispute with ENTITY whose oil drilling and pipelines have polluted the country. Tens of billions of dollars in restitution from ENTITY are at stake but Moreno said he is willing to give them up. In fact, the IMF loan is strange in that it was dependent on Ecuador paying external debt obligations; i.e., it was not new funds for Ecuador but new debt to subsidize paying back Wall Street.\n\nIn making the announcement, Moreno called the people \Z�nganos,\"" or Drone Bees leading to the uprising of the Drone Bees. The mass protests were called by the Popular Front, a group of unions, and the Unified Workers Federation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE). Students and social movements joined protests throughout the nation in Loja, Guayaquil, Cuenca, Ambato, and Riobamba, among other cites as well as Quito, the capital. Moreno claimed without any evidence that the uprising was financed by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Correa.\n\nProtests in Ecuador were relentless with no end in sight. They grew when 20,000 indigenous people marched into Quito. Police responded with violence, tear gas, and mass arrests. An October 4 video circulated on social media showed nonviolent protesters killed in the street by the police as well as other police violence. On October 5, Moreno declared a 60-day state of Emergency. Sometimes police had to retreat in the face of mass protests. On October 7, Moreno fled the capital to hide in the Navy base 260 miles away in the conservative stronghold of Guayaquil.\n\nAs we wrote this newsletter, unrest in Ecuador was escalating. On Saturday, the nation was put on military lockdown. Law enforcement attacked protesters with pellets and tear gas in the immediate vicinity of the National Assembly. By Sunday, Moreno decreed a 3:00 pm curfew, which people defied. Then, facing an emergency session in the National Assembly, Moreno backed down. Protesters celebrated when Moreno's government announced that Decree 883 had been repealed after eleven days of popular mobilizations.\n\nPeter Koenig describes a root cause of the problems:\n\nSince January 2000, Ecuador's economy is 100% dollarized, compliments of the IMF (entirely controlled by the US Treasury, by force of an absolute veto). The other two fully dollarized Latin American countries are El Salvador and Panama.\n\nThe US and IMF used the economic crises of the 1990s to dollarize Ecuador's economy and gain full control over the nation's riches as Ecuador is the second-largest oil economy in South America. This led to unaffordable goods for Ecuadorians, social unrest and a series of unstable governments until President Correa, who served from 2007 to 17, was elected.\n\nA Center for Economic and Policy Research 2017 report found under Correa Ecuador did well with an average annual GDP growth of 1.5% compared to 0.6% average for the previous 26 years; a decline of 38% in poverty with extreme poverty reduced by 47%; and a decline in inequality with the Gini coefficient falling substantially. Correa doubled social spending from 4.3% in 2006 to 8.6% in 2016; tripling education spending from 0.7% to 2.1%; and, increasing public investments from 4% of GDP in 2006 to 10% in 2016.\n\nCorrea served two terms. A third term would have required a constitutional amendment. Rather than running, Correa endorsed Lenin Moreno who had served as his vice president from 2007-13. He was expected to continue Correa's policies but instead reversed them.\n\nMoreno was unpopular before announcing 'The Package' due to structural poverty increasing from 23.1 percent in June 2017 to 25.5 percent in June 2019 with projections of 30 percent by the end of the year. Injustices like the imprisonment of the popular former Vice President Jorge Glas on dubious charges and his continuous political witch hunt against Rafael Correa and other leaders of the Citizens' Revolution Party added to his unpopularity. In addition, he has been engulfed in a personal corruption crisis involving an offshore Shell ENTITY INA, which cast Moreno's presidency in doubt.\n\nMoreno's forcible and illegal ejection of Julian Assange from the London embassy in return for payoffs from the US and UK resulted in a national strike in Ecuador in July. This, along with the arrest of Ola Bini, who is being prosecuted falsely as a conspirator with Wikileaks, was unpopular with Ecuadorians.\n\nWill repeal of 'The Package' end the protests and the threat to Moreno's presidency? As we write, the answer to these questions are unclear. The people won a major victory, but the Moreno/IMF infection remains.\n\nRally in Argentina (By Enfoque Rojo)\n\nLatin Americans Rising Against the Right and US Domination\n\nLatin American countries are rejecting neoliberalism and US domination using multiple strategies to achieve change.\n\nThis month the deepening anti-capitalist movement in Bolivia is set to strengthen with the probable re-election of Evo Morales on October 20. Argentina is expected to remove right-wing President Mauricio Macri on October 27 and replace him with Alberto Fernandez. And, Mexico put in place its first progressive, left-of-center government with the election of Andr�s Manuel L�pez Obrador (AMLO) on July 1, 2018. Elections are also upcoming in Uruguay on October 27 and in Peru in January. Venezuela may have National Assembly elections in January as well.\n\nBolivia's Evo Morales has a 13-point lead in polls as his governing party Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) looks to re-election for a third Morales term that will last until 2025. Morales has 38.8 percent, just 1.2 percent short of the 40 percent required for a first-round victory in the upcoming elections. The survey also indicated majority support for the nationalization of gas and strategic industries, 51 percent say that public ownership is positive for the economy. On social programs, 61.7 percent say they are essential for providing dignity to those of low incomes.\n\nMorales has launched a large reforestation plan and put in place a model healthcare program. He is under attack from the United States and segments of Bolivia. Morales leads an independent, sovereign Bolivia that has rejected US dominance, decolonized and displaced neoliberalism. A recent color revolution attempt by the wealthy, with the support of the US and western powers, failed.\n\nArgentina's first round of voting on August 11 resulted in Fernandez, running with former president Cristina Kirchner, finishing 15 percent ahead of Macri. The surprising landslide brought into question Macri's ability to govern between now and the election. As a result, the IMF put a $5.4 billion dollar loan on hold part of the $56.3 billion stand-by agreement signed in mid-2018. Fernandez opposed the loan, which required sharp budget cuts affecting public services at a time of increasing poverty.\n\nUnder Macri, the economy has gone into crisis with poverty increasing to a record 36.4 percent, a recession accompanied by a 47 percent inflation rate in 2018 and an inflation rate of 25.1 percent during the first seven months of this year. Argentina's unemployment is at the highest level in 14 years. Poverty was at 19.7 percent when Kirchner left office in 2015. Fernandez has put forward an anti-hunger plan, not dependent on the IMF. Three weeks before the election, thousands of people rallied in Buenos Aires as the Workers Left Front sent a message of opposition to neoliberalism and austerity to the two major political parties.\n\nIn Mexico, AMLO won a landslide 53 percent of the vote on July 31 ending decades of right-wing rule. People were fed up with the corruption, impunity, and violence -- decades of loss of rights, pillaging and destruction of the nation's wealth and public enterprises. At his inauguration, AMLO decried 36 years of neoliberalism and public and private corruption, promised a \""peaceful and radical\"" transition with \""indigenous people as its priority,\"" in a government \""for the good of all, first the poor.\"" His fight against neoliberalism is challenged by NAFTA II (or the USMCA), as AMLO is careful not to confront Trump on this. On border policy, AMLO offered migrants home in Mexico and urged investment in Central America.\n\nThe Zapatistas have conflicted with AMLO over the exploitation of resources and the use of the military in policing, demanding its autonomy based on indigenous principles but he has sought diplomacy with them. AMLO has also faced massive strikes of tens of thousands of autoworkers, workers at US companies in Mexico and wildcat strikes at the border. AMLO has been a counterweight to US aggression in Latin America standing with Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba.\n\nPeru is in the midst of a crisis. President Martin Vizcarra who came into office after a corruption scandal removed his predecessor, dissolved the Congress, a move supported by the left, because it is controlled by far-right politician Keiko Fujimori and was preventing Vizcarra's anti-corruption campaign. Congress ignored the president's order and voted to remove him from office instead. The vice president resigned rather than take over and Vizcarra remains in office with the support of the military. He has now called for new congressional elections to be held on January 26. Vizcarra is a conservative battling the oligarchic right. The left, which has been divided, is coalescing around the Popular National Assembly and allying with social movements. The movements want an end to neoliberal policies, a Constituent Assembly to draft a new Constitution and to break with Washington's domination.\n\nIn Central America, Honduras has been in revolt against the coup government of Juan Orlando Hernandez (JOH), which for ten years has put in place neoliberalism, repression, and violence. Protests have been ongoing since his coup and fraudulent re-election. This summer, protests intensified with a national strike over austerity and privatization measures required by an IMF loan, leading to a 66-day uprising. The US has trained Honduran police to use repressive measures in an attempt to stop the protests, but their actions feed more protests.\n\nMany have fled Honduras in caravans to escape the corruption and violence. Now, a coalition of civil groups is urging the president's departure over a scandal ignited by accusations of large-scale drug trafficking to the United States being litigated against the president's brother Juan Antonio \""Tony\"" Hernandez. In the trial, several witnesses have declared JOH's campaign was financed with drug money, and that he took millions in bribes from various Mexican drug lords, including the infamous Joaquin \""El-Chapo\"" Guzman. The Liberal Party joined in calling for his resignation and protests have intensified. The trial may be the end of this cocaine-fueled presidency.\n\nBrazil's election of Bolsonaro has been marred by scandal now that the corruption of Operation Car Wash has been exposed. Private conversations between the prosecutors and then-judge Sergio Moro, now Super Minister of Justice, show that former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was the \""victim of a conspiracy\"" to prevent him from running against Bolsonaro. In the secret exchanges, Moro admitted that the corruption case was designed to frame him. Lula has said the US is behind the conspiracy.\n\nCalls to free Lula are increasing and the Supreme Court will be reviewing the case. Lula is demanding his record be cleared and refused a panicked offer from prosecutors that he be freed from jail and put under house arrest. Bolsonaro is also under attack for the Amazon fires, for an increase in police killings, for genocide against the Indigenous and for attacks on public education. Former President Michel Temer acknowledged that the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff, the Worker's Party leader, was a coup d'etat.\n\nNicaragua survived a 2018 US coup attempt and the revolution continues to thrive after 40 years of independence from US domination after US-backed dictator Anastasio Somoza fled. People were very confused about what happened in the 2018 coup attempt as media misinformation was prevalent. A group of us joined and produced a reader to help people understand the reality of Nicaragua. Peace is coming back to Nicaragua, even though continued pressure from the US is expected in the form of new illegal sanctions.\n\nVenezuela, which we have reported on intensively for years, has also survived ongoing coup attempts that continue to escalate in the post-John Bolton era of the Trump administration most recently with a threat of war through the Organization of American States (OAS). They are prepared for a military attack and have created new alliances to overcome the US economic war. This week, Russia announced it was investing $16.5 billion in Venezuela by the end of 2019.\n\nRussia has provided anti-missile defense systems, is keeping Navy ships in Venezuela to deter a US blockade and has helped gather intelligence on US actions. With their help, Venezuela has uncovered terrorist plots coming from Colombia and involving US-puppet Juan Guiado's team. Guaido has faltered and failed time and again, and now is being investigated for ties to Colombian drug traffickers and corruption.\n\nThe non-aligned movement of 120 nations met in Caracas this summer and expressed support for Venezuelan sovereignty. Venezuela has been a lynchpin for left movements in Latin America. When oil prices were high, it shared its wealth not only with poorest Venezuelans but with other countries seeking to challenge US and oligarch domination. Even in the midst of an escalating economic war with the United States, they continue to provide housing, food, and essentials to their people.\n\nIn the Caribbean, Cuba is challenged by the US economic war but continues its revolution. Mass protests in Haiti threaten the survival of the government and Puerto Rico's revolt removed a governor.\n\nCuba, despite the increasing US economic war, continues to be a bulwark against US imperialism, standing with governments like Venezuela and Nicaragua when they are under attack. Cuba completed a successful transition to a new president, Miguel D�az-Canel, and voted on a new constitution developed using a participatory process involving 9 million people through 133,000 citizen meetings. The constitution includes \""universal and free health, education, sports and recreation, culture and respect for human dignity.\"" Cuba is currently facing major economic challenges as the US is blocking their access to oil. Russia and Venezuela are helping Cuba overcome this oil blockade.\n\nHaiti has been in protest since April calling for an end to neoliberal US domination and the resignation of Jovenel Moise. The president has not spoken in public since the beginning of this latest round of protests and this week he named a commission of seven politicians to lead discussions for a solution to end the crisis.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, a colony of the United States, massive protests led to Governor Ricardo A. Rossell� resigning on July 22, 2019. People also want the corrupt legislature cleaned out, the Fiscal Control Board, created by Obama, ended and the debt to be audited. Former political prisoner, Luis Rosa, said three things are needed: \""decolonization, an end to our colonial status through a constitutional assembly; health care, free for all Puerto Rican citizens; and free public education up through the university level.\""\n\nStephen Sefton wrote a country-by-country review of Latin America and the Caribbean in June describing the decline of the United States in the region and how changes were coming to many nations. He predicted that we are seeing \""the last throw of the dice for the US to retain its accustomed power and influence against the relentless fundamental drive for emancipation by the region's impoverished majority.\""\n\nRafael Correa said: \""Neoliberalism is what failed, not socialism of the 21st century, on the contrary, socialism of the 21st century is what has us firmly on our feet, withstanding all of these difficulties.\"" This hemisphere is a key battleground in the conflict between neoliberalism v Socialism and US dominance v. independence. People are demanding democracy from the bottom up and a fair economy that meets their needs."
Chevron Corporation,1,"Chris Hedges, an ordained Presbyterian minister, gave this sermon Sunday at the Claremont Presbyterian Church in Claremont, Calif.\n\nImmanuel Kant coined the term \radical evil.\"" It was the privileging of one's own interest over that of others, effectively reducing those around you to objects to be manipulated and used for your own ends. But Hannah Arendt, who also used the term \""radical evil,\"" saw that it was worse than merely treating others as objects. Radical evil, she wrote, rendered vast numbers of people superfluous. They possessed no value at all. They were, once they could not be utilized by the powerful, discarded as human refuse.\n\nWe live in an age of radical evil. The architects of this evil are despoiling the earth and driving the human species toward extinction. They are stripping us of our most basic civil liberties and freedoms. They are orchestrating the growing social inequity, concentrating wealth and power in the hands of a cabal of global oligarchs. They are destroying our democratic institutions, turning elected office into a system of legalized bribery, stacking our courts with judges who invert constitutional rights so that unlimited corporate money invested in political campaigns is disguised as the right to petition the government or a form of free speech. Their seizure of power has vomited up demagogues and con artists including Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, each the distortion of a failed democracy. They are turning America's poor communities into internal militarized colonies where police carry out lethal campaigns of terror and use the blunt instrument of mass incarceration as a tool of social control. They are waging endless wars in the Middle East and diverting half of all discretionary spending to a bloated military. They are placing the rights of the ENTITY above the rights of the citizen.\n\nArendt captured the radical evil of a corporate capitalism in which people are rendered superfluous -- surplus labor as Karl Marx said -- and pushed to the margins of society where they and their children are no longer considered to have value, value always determined by the amount of money produced and amassed. But as the Gospel of Luke reminds us, \""what is prized by human beings is an abomination in the sight of God.\""\n\nWho are those who would sacrifice us on the altar of global capitalism? How did they amass the power to deny us a voice, to insist that the earth is an inert commodity they have a right to exploit until the ecosystem that sustains life collapses and the human species, along with most other species, becomes extinct?\n\nThese architects of radical evil have been here from the beginning. They are the slaveholders who crammed men, women and children into the holds of ships and sold them in auctions in Charleston and Montgomery, rending families apart, taking from them their names, language, religion and culture. They wielded the whips, the chains, the dogs and the slave patrols. They orchestrated the holocaust of slavery, and when slavery was abolished, after a war that left 700,000 dead, they used convict leasing -- slavery by another name -- along with lynching and black codes, to carry out a reign of terror that continues today in our deindustrialized cities and our prisons. Black and brown bodies are worth nothing to our corporate masters when on the streets of our decayed cities, but locked in cages they each generate 50 or 60 thousand dollars a year. Some people say the system does not work. They are wrong. The system works exactly as it is designed to work.\n\nThese architects of radical evil are the white militias and Army units that stole the land, decimated the herds of buffalo, signed the treaties that were promptly violated and carried out a campaign of genocide against indigenous people, penning the few who remained in prisoner of war camps. They are the gun thugs, Baldwin-Felts and Pinkerton agents who gunned down, by the hundreds, American workers struggling to organize, forces of the kind that today oversee the bonded labor of workers in China, Vietnam and Bangladesh. They are the oligarchs, J.P. Morgan, Rockefeller and Carnegie, who paid for these rivers of blood, and who today, like Tim Cook at Apple and Jeff Bezos at Amazon, amass staggering fortunes from human misery.\n\nWe know these architects of radical evil. They are the DNA of American capitalism. You can find them on the commodity desks at Goldman Sachs. The financial firm's commodities index is the most heavily traded in the world. These traders buy up futures of rice, wheat, corn, sugar and livestock and jack up the commodity prices by as much as 200% on the global market so that the poor in Asia, Africa and Latin America can no longer afford basic staples, and starve. Hundreds of millions of people go hungry to feed this mania for profit, this radical evil that sees human beings, including children, as worth nothing.\n\nThese architects of radical evil extract the coal, oil and gas, poisoning our air, soil and water, while demanding huge taxpayer subsidies and blocking the urgent transition to renewable energy. They are the massive ENTITYs that own the factory farms, egg hatcheries and dairy farms where tens of billions of animals endure horrendous abuse before being needlessly slaughtered, part of an animal agriculture industry that is one of the leading multi-factorial causes of climate catastrophe. They are the generals and arms manufacturers. They are the bankers, hedge fund managers and global speculators who looted $7 trillion from the U.S. treasury after the pyramid schemes and fraud they carried out imploded the global economy in 2007-2008. They are the goons in state security who make us the most spied-upon, watched, monitored and photographed population in human history. When your government watches you 24 hours a day you cannot use the word \""liberty.\"" This is the relationship between a master and a slave.\n\nCorporate culture serves a faceless system. It is, as Hannah Arendt wrote, \""the rule of nobody and for this very reason perhaps the least human and most cruel form of rulership.\"" It will stop at nothing. Anyone or any movement that attempts to impede their profits will be targeted for obliteration. These architects of radical evil are incapable of reform. Appealing to their better nature is a waste of time. They don't have one. They have rigged the system, elections dominated by corporate money, the courts, the press a vast burlesque show for profit, which is why they spend so much time focused on Trump. There is no way to vote against the interests of Goldman Sachs or Exxon, Shell, BP and ENTITY, which along with the other top 20 fossil fuel ENTITYs have contributed 35% of all energy-related carbon dioxide and methane emissions worldwide -- 480 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent since 1965.\n\nWe know these architects of radical evil. They have been and always will be with us.\n\nBut who are those who resist? Where do they come from? What historical, social and cultural forces created them?\n\nThey too are familiar. They are Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner, John Brown, Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass. They are Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse and Chief Joseph. They are Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Emma Goldman. They are \""Big Bill\"" Haywood, Joe Hill and Eugene V. Debs. They are Woody Guthrie, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Ella Baker and Fannie Lou Hamer. They are Andrea Dworkin and Caesar Chavez. They are those who from the beginning fought back, often to be defeated by this radical evil but knowing they were called to defy it, even at the cost of their own reputations, financial security, social standing and sometimes their lives.\n\nThe architects of radical evil are disemboweling every last social service program funded by the taxpayers, from education to Social Security, because lives that do not swell their profits are considered superfluous. Let the sick die. Let many of the poor -- 41 million people, including children -- go to bed hungry. Let families be tossed into the streets. Let the young graduate have no meaningful employment. Let the U.S. prison system, with 25% of the world's prison population, swell. Let torture continue. Let assault rifles proliferate to fuel the epidemic of mass shootings. Let the roads, bridges, dams, levees, power grids, rail lines, subways, bus services, schools and libraries crumble or close. Let the rising temperatures, the freak weather patterns, the monster cyclones and hurricanes, the droughts, the flooding, the tornadoes, the wildfires, the melting polar ice caps, the poisoned water systems and the polluted air worsen until the species dies."
Chevron Corporation,1,"The man is so beautifully bland. In fact, I'd wager that only a tiny segment of Americans could name the current Secretary of Defense - and far fewer could pick him out of a lineup. Perhaps that's the point. President Trump, a celebrity ham, has tired of sharing the stage with big-name advisers such as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and national security adviser John Bolton. So they're both gone. In their place, Trump has installed faceless bureaucrats to run the most powerful national security state in human history. And the rest of us hardly notice.\n\nTrump's appointment of Mark Esper as head of the largest and most active Cabinet department, and the new Defense Secretary's near unanimous approval by the U.S. Senate, is no less of a scandal than Trump's apparent efforts to seek foreign interference in the 2020 elections. Only it isn't.\n\nStill, the nomination of Esper, a recent lobbyist for the defense contracting ENTITY Raytheon, ranks as one of the most egregious illustrations of the \revolving door\"" between lobbyists and the Defense Department. It's crony capitalism in fatigues, and while nothing new, a clear indication that things have only worsened under our reality-show-mogul-president.\n\nOf course, seen through the rose-colored glasses of American empire, Esper is highly qualified to head the Defense Department. He's a West Point graduate, former Army infantry officer, recipient of a master's degree in public administration from Harvard and a doctorate in public policy from George Washington University, and has past experience working in the Pentagon.\n\nIf one digs further, however, Esper is wildly problematic -- loaded with conflicts of interest, a veteran of the (should be) discredited neoconservative Bush-era DOD, and little more than a corporate \""company man.\"" He didn't just work for Raytheon, he lobbied on the defense contractor's behalf only recently. Under rather sharp questioning by Sen. Elizabeth Warren during his confirmation hearings, Esper refused to recuse himself from participating in government business involving Raytheon. In typically lifeless language, Esper replied that \""On the advice of my ethics folks at the Pentagon, the career professionals: No, their recommendation is not to.\"" How's that for accepting responsibility? No matter, he was swiftly and quietly confirmed by a vote of 90-8 in the Senate.\n\nExpect another banner year for Raytheon. It's already the third-largest US defense contractor, and produces, among other tools of destruction, Paveway precision-guided missiles -- the very weapons that Congress recently sought to stop shipping to Saudi Arabia due to (rather tardy) concerns about the heads of Yemeni civilians upon which they're dropped.\n\nI predict more deals and more taxpayer billions for Raytheon with Esper at the Defense helm. Not that the company has done poorly during the Trump years. In 2018, Raytheon CEO Thomas Kennedy candidly quipped that \""It's the best time that we've ever seen for the defense industry.\"" Not for indebted taxpayers, bombed-out Middle Easterners or US soldiers still dying in endless wars, it's not. But sure, it truly is the best of times for what prominent American leaders -- once upon a time -- labeled the \""merchants of death.\""\n\nConflicts of interest, sliding seamlessly between defense contracting boards and the Pentagon, and securing post-government largesse on corporate boards, that's an old story indeed. Looking back to 2001, most Defense Secretaries have troublesome private sector connections. Donald Rumsfeld entered the Pentagon after a 24-year business career; Robert Gates was on the board of directors of Fidelity Investments and the Parker Drilling Company; Chuck Hagel served on the boards of ENTITY and Deutsche Bank; Ash Carter -- an exception -- was mostly an academic and a bureaucratic wonk, but still consulted for Goldman Sachs. All made millions.\n\nThat covers the Bush and Obama years. What we've seen in the Trump administration, is, however, something far more brazen. His three Secretaries of Defense (one of whom, Patrick Shanahan, was only acting head) have been unapologetically ensconced in the world of defense contracting and corporate lobbying.\n\n\""Saint\"" Jim Mattis had, while still a general, encouraged the military to buy the blood test products of Theranos, then dropped the service and joined its corporate board. But Theranos' products did not work, the deal described by the Securities and Exchange Commission as an \""elaborate, years-long fraud.\"" Mattis also served, both before and after his Pentagon stint, on the board of General Dynamics, the nation's fifth largest defense contractor. Nonetheless, Mattis easily slid through his confirmation and was praised by all types of mainstream media as the administration's \""adult in the room.\""\n\nAfter Mattis resigned, he being unable to countenance even Trump's hints at modest withdrawal from the wars in Syria and Afghanistan, Patrick Shanahan stepped in as interim defense chief. Unlike his predecessor, Shanahan didn't emerge from the military, but rather from yet another defense contractor, Boeing, for which he's worked some 30 years. Trump thought that was dandy and nominated him to officially replace Mattis, but Shanahan decided to withdraw due to alleged personal scandals. Enter Mark Esper, Raytheon lobbyist extraordinaire.\n\nEsper's in good company in Washington's military-industrial swamp. Recent reports by the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) -- a vital organization that hardly any American has heard of -- identified \""645 instances in the past 10 years in which a retired senior official, member of Congress or senior legislative staff member became employed as a registered lobbyist, board member or business executive at a major government contractor.\"" POGO also noted that \""those walking through the revolving door included 25 generals, nine admirals, 43 lieutenant generals and 23 vice admirals.\""\n\nAll of which begs some questions and provides some disturbing answers. Perhaps we ought to ditch the myth that the Defense Secretary simply heads the Pentagon, and admit that Esper is really the emperor of a far grander military-industrial complex that includes a veritable army of K-Street lobbyists and venal arms dealers. Maybe it's time to concede that unelected national security czars, and not a stalemated bought-and-sold Congress, run national defense and set the gigantic Pentagon budget. Perhaps we should confess to ourselves that the nation's vaunted soldiers are little more than political pawns in a game that's far bigger, far more Kafkaesque, than those troopers could begin to fathom. And, finally, let's admit one last thing: Few of us care."
Kadmon Holdings,0,"NEW YORK, Oct. 9, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- In 2019, the American Cancer Society projected 1.76 million new cancer cases diagnosed and the number of deaths to stand at 606,880 in the U.S. Overall, the alarming projection has caused concern within the biotechnology marketspace. In response, biotechnology companies, specifically companies dabbling in the immunotherapy and oncology sector, are working to develop innovative treatments and therapies in order to effectively treat patients diagnosed with cancer. Mainly, most patients suffer from lung, breast, and prostate cancer, and in 2019, the National Cancer Institute expects 268,000 new breast cancer cases, 228,150 new lung cancer cases, as well as 174,650 new prostate cancer cases. Overall, several new cancer treatments such as immunomodulators, CAR-T cell therapy, and monoclonal antibodies are also becoming more abundant as biotechnology companies further develop and market these therapies. Compared to traditional treatments, these therapies are more technologically advanced, meaning they are more effective at suppressing or possibly even eliminating cancer. However, despite the progress in technology, the demand for cancer therapies isn't slowing down. Patients and medical institutes are constantly looking for more effective and efficient treatments in order to reduce the number of cases. And according to data compiled by Grand View Research, the global cancer immunotherapy market size is expected to reach USD 126.9 Billion by 2026 while exhibiting a CAGR of 9.6%. Additionally, the industry is expected to grow due to the increasing patient pools and higher mortality rates, while an increasing number of approvals for new immunotherapeutic drugs is also expected to propel the market. Oncology Pharma Inc. (OTC:ONPH), ENTITY, Inc. (NYSE:KDMN), Advaxis, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADXS), SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLS), Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN)\n\nThere is an ongoing shift from traditional chemotherapies to immunotherapies, which also has an impact on the market by further propelling its growth. In addition to early detection and treatment of cancer, the immuno-oncology industry is also developing post-treatment therapies to better protect patients from recurrence. There has also been an introduction of immunomodulatory drugs such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide, which were among the best treatment options in the past few years. As well as an influx of newer drug classes like antibodies and HDAC inhibitors which are designed to target specific cancers. \Faced with growing clinical workloads and decreasing margins, oncologists are under a growing amount of pressure at work,\"" said Joe DePinto, President of Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions. \""But, as our research shows, many oncologists are meeting their challenges head-on by proactively investing in tools, technology and additional clinical support staff. And today they are feeling more confident in their ability to adapt to changing trends, such as value-based care.\""\n\nOncology Pharma Inc. (OTC:ONPH) announced yesterday that, \""Stefan Gruenwald (MD, PhD), cofounder and president of Diagnomics Inc., has been elected to Oncology Pharma's supervisory board of directors. Dr. Stefan Gruenwald is a former VP of Research and Development at Becton Dickinson, a conglomerate with a current market capitalization of approximately $68 Billion. He is the co-founder and managing partner of Genautica, established in December of 2010. Genautica is a California LLC located in close proximity to the Biotech Hub of San Diego.\n\nDr. Stefan Gruenwald, through Genautica, has seed-funded Diagnomics, a biotech company employing a highly qualified team of scientists, including early pioneers in sequencing the human genome. Through its investment in Diagnomics, Genautica has also been a co-founder and early investment partner of the EONE-Diagnomics Genome Center (EDGC) in Korea, which went public in 2018 on KOSDAQ, the major Korean tech stock market for over 400 Million USD. Part of the IPO proceeds have been used to buy a female health clinic (10,000 patients), build an R&D center in Songdo, Korea, housing 14 biotech and pharmaceutical companies, acquiring one of the major diagnostics distribution companies and expanding the clinical genome center approach to various countries in Asia. EDGC has grown rapidly and annual revenues for 2019 are predicted to be around 50 million USD.\n\nChuck Wagner, President of Oncology Pharma Inc., commented: \""Oncology Pharma conducted an exhaustive search to strengthen the board of directors' breadth of background and talent. I am delighted to have such an outstanding individual join the board to contribute to our mission, vision and goal of the company.

(NYSE:KDMN) presented earlier last year preclinical data on KD033, its anti-PD-L1/IL-15 fusion protein in development for oncology indications, at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting, taking place November 7-11, 2018, in Washington, D.C. KD033 is a novel immunotherapy designed to stimulate an immune response directed to the tumor microenvironment. Recombinant IL-15 alone, which stimulates cancer-fighting immune effector cells, is not well tolerated when administered systemically. ENTITY has developed a novel approach to overcome this challenge by fusing IL-15 to an anti-PD-L1 antibody to direct IL-15 activity specifically to the tumor microenvironment, promoting efficacy and inducing durable responses while potentially increasing tolerability. \""Although immunotherapy has been game-changing for the treatment of cancer, many tumors learn to evade current therapies, limiting efficacy and durability of response. New approaches are needed to address relapsed or refractory patients as well as non-responders,\"" said Harlan W. Waksal, M.D., President and CEO at ENTITY. \""By directing a potent cancer-fighting response to the tumor site, KD033 has potential to safely overcome resistance and induce long-lasting responses for patients.

(NASDAQ:ADXS) a late-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of immunotherapy products, announced recently updated data from the Phase 1/2 KEYNOTE-046 study in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This trial is being conducted in conjunction with Merck (known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada) and is evaluating ADXS-PSA, one of Advaxis' Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)-based immunotherapies, alone and in combination with KEYTRUDA� (pembrolizumab), Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy. Findings will be highlighted in a poster discussion entitled \""Effects of ADXS-PSA with or without Pembrolizumab on Survival and Antigen Spreading in Metastatic, Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients\"" at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting underway in Atlanta. The poster discussion will be held today from 1:00-5:00 p.m. ET and will be led by lead author Mark N. Stein M.D., FACS, Associate Professor of Medical Oncology at Columbia University Medical Center. \""We are very excited to report the updated ADXS-PSA data today at the AACR meeting,\"" said Kenneth A. Berlin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Advaxis. \""These data show the clinical potential of ADXS-PSA both alone and in combination with KEYTRUDA�. It is meaningful that the combination has been well-tolerated in the study population because dose-related toxicities can present challenges for cancer patients, and an additive therapy with a favorable safety and tolerability profile may offer an attractive option for clinicians if developed further in this indication.\"" He concluded, \""Based on the prolonged survival data and strong safety profile to date, we believe that continued clinical development of ADXS-PSA in combination with KEYTRUDA� is warranted and represents a potentially significant opportunity for Advaxis.\""\n\nSELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLS) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on novel cancer immunotherapeutics for a broad range of cancer indications. SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc. recently announced the dosing of the first patient in its Phase 1/2 open-label study of GPS in combination with Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA� (pembrolizumab), in patients with selected WT1-positive advanced cancers, including both solid tumors and hematologic malignances. \""This is an important milestone as this study allows us to potentially enhance our safety and activity profile of GPS in combination with anti-PD-1 therapies, particularly in combination with KEYTRUDA� in multiple malignances, following intriguing initial combination clinical data with OPDIVO�,\"" said Angelos M. Stergiou, M.D., ScD h.c., President and Chief Executive Officer of SELLAS. \""We are confident this study will build on our body of clinical evidence in support of the use of GPS in combination with PD-1 inhibitors to benefit cancer patients with limited treatment options. We believe that our innovative WT1 immunotherapeutic, GPS, in combination with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy agents, may provide therapeutic benefit for patients with WT1 expression. These beliefs are shared by the renowned U.S. oncologists who are undertaking this work. We look forward to studying this combination in patients with a wide range of cancers and expect to provide the first clinical data from this study in the first quarter of 2020.\""\n\nGeron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN) is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and potential commercialization of a first-in-class telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, in hematologic myeloid malignancies. Geron Corporation recently announced the opening of patient screening and enrollment for the Phase 3 portion of IMerge to evaluate imetelstat, a first-in-class telomerase inhibitor, in lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). IMerge is a two-part Phase 2/3 clinical trial of imetelstat in transfusion dependent patients with lower risk MDS who are relapsed after or refractory to erythroid stimulating agents (ESAs). The Phase 3 portion is planned to enroll approximately 170 patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the hypothesis that imetelstat improves the rate of red blood cell transfusion independence (TI). The trial is planned to be conducted at multiple medical centers globally, including North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. The primary efficacy endpoint is 8-week TI rate, which is defined as the proportion of patients achieving transfusion independence during any consecutive eight weeks since entry into the trial. Key secondary endpoints include the rate of transfusion independence lasting at least 24 weeks, or 24-week TI rate, durability of transfusion independence and the amount and relative change in transfusions. \""The start of the Phase 3 portion of IMerge is a significant milestone for Geron and imetelstat,\"" said John A. Scarlett, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \""We are hopeful that the Phase 3 will confirm the encouraging results from the Phase 2 portion, and that imetelstat could become a much-needed treatment alternative for patients with lower risk MDS.\""\n\nPlease Note: FinancialBuzz.com is not a financial advisory or advisor, investment advisor or broker-dealer and do not undertake any activities that would require such registration.

COUNTY SOVEREIGNTY COMMITTEE,0,"An addendum to the Building Bridges Initiative task force report last Wednesday leaves President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga with the discretion of deciding whether the country should go for a referendum to change the Constitution or not.\n\nThis comes in the wake of strong indications that the team has recommended alterations to the Executive to accommodate more players after the next elections, reintroducing the premiership, among other far-reaching changes.\n\nMultiple sources at the final meeting on October 23, the same day the term of the team expired, told us there was no consensus on the question of a referendum, the only motion that ended in a deadlock.\n\nCHANGES\n\nThose opposed to it, they said, held that any other changes in law needed to give the report life should be through Parliament.\n\nThe Sunday Nation learnt that Mr Odinga on Saturday retreated for a meeting with his trusted allies at the Coast to prepare them on possible scenarios before the final handover.\n\nHosted by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, the meeting was also attended by Kilifi ENTITY boss Amason Kingi and Minority Whip Junet Mohamed.\n\nMr Odinga is said to have tasked them to begin marshalling support for the recommendations, some that could see governors who are serving their final terms in office find a new lease of life in the new structure of government.\n\nLater on, they attended the burial of Michael Ngumbao, the slain uncle of the newly-elected Ganda MCA Ruben Katana in Malindi.\n\nA confidante of President Kenyatta also hinted at a silent mobilisation that is underway to enhance the acceptability of the report in his Central Kenya bedrock.\n\nMr Kenyatta is said to have taken exception to the move by Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri to lead a host of Mount Kenya MPs on Thursday in a press conference at Parliament Buildings to spell out conditions that must be met for them to embrace the yet-to-be-released recommendations.\n\nINCLUSIVITY\n\n\We are concerned about the underrepresentation of our people at all levels compared to the population and the number of voters in the region.\n\nWhen we talk about inclusivity, it must be reflected even in representation in Parliament and other spheres.\n\nIf the BBI does not address the challenges of equalisation of the vote, under the universal suffrage principle of one-man-one-vote, then we will sit down and advise our electorate accordingly,\"" the leaders said in a statement read by the lawmaker for Ndaragwa, Mr Jeremiah Kioni.\n\nThe popularity of the referendum among the committee members somewhat diminished after acting Treasury CS Ukur Yattani met the BBI team at the Sagana State Lodge, Nyeri, in the company of other technocrats and reportedly told them that the economy was not in a position to cater for a referendum before the next polls.\n\nThere were strong signals that President Uhuru Kenyatta would receive the BBI report on Sunday ahead of his expected trip to Saudi Arabia on Monday.\n\nHe returned to the country last evening from Sochi, Russia, where President Vladimir Putin hosted African heads of state for a summit.\n\nA member of the committee told us that they had all been asked to 'hang around' just in case the much-awaited call from the State House comes through.\n\nFrom Saudi Arabia, President Kenyatta is listed among guests at the swearing-in ceremony of President Mokgweetsi Masisi of Botswana.\n\nDEMOCRACY\n\nWith battle lines drawn ahead of the team making the report public, Deputy President William Ruto yesterday denied that he was walking a tightrope, having in the past said he would not support any recommendations that would seek to expand the Executive arm of government.\n\n\""Dilemma? No way! Jubilee as a democratic party celebrates diversity of opinion free of hate and focused on transformation for all; for us big or small matters but ultimately as initiators of inclusive non-tribal political discourse we will stand behind our Party and Leader,\"" he said.\n\nThe DP is alive to the fact that a referendum would not only redraw the country's political landscape but may also tilt the scales to his disadvantage as opposed to the current arrangement where he is almost assured of succeeding President Kenyatta in 2022.\n\nWhile his boss insists that BBI report would be the antidote for the ills facing the country, Dr Ruto is of the view that the content of the report must be subjected to a public debate by Kenyans before it can be adopted or rejected.\n\nSCATHING ATTACK\n\nNarok North MP Moitalel ole Kenta thinks a section of the political class's scathing attack on the BBI, even before its contents become clear, reflects an all-out opposition by forces allied to Dr Ruto to anything that Mr Kenyatta and Mr Odinga stand for.\n\n\""It also reflects a certain level of entitlement of politicians from certain communities to the leadership of the country. It is as if without them being leaders, there will be no Kenya.\""\n\nArticle 255 of the Constitution stipulates that any proposed changes to the supreme law that would affect the supremacy of this Constitution, the territory of Kenya, the ENTITY of the people, the national values and principles of governance, must be subjected to a referendum.\n\nOther areas are the Bill of Rights; the term of office of the President; the independence of the Judiciary and the commissions and independent offices to which Chapter 15 applies and the functions of Parliament.\n\nThere have been serious doubts whether President Kenyatta would want to subject the country to a referendum, a divisive exercise at a time he is racing against time to firm up his legacy.\n\nPOLITICAL CEASEFIRE\n\nAlready, he has two years to implement his projects before the campaign proper sets in. DP Ruto's camp is happy to sell this narrative. Well aware that the bicameral legislature is Dr Ruto's playground, his allies are itching to have the two Houses consider the recommendations of the BBI team.\n\nSome of the President's men, however, say he has no qualms pursuing the referendum route should it be contained in the report.\n\nA product of political ceasefire between Mr Kenyatta and Mr Odinga, the BBI team was formed after the March 9 handshake and mandated to come up with a solution to nine agendas, namely ethnic antagonism, lack of a national ethos, how to foster inclusivity, strengthening devolution and curing divisive elections.\n\nThe report is expected to cover aspects of safety and security, eradicating runaway corruption, enabling shared prosperity and entrenching rights and responsibilities.\n\nOn Saturday, task force chairman Yusuf Haji reiterated that the document was done."
COUNTY SOVEREIGNTY COMMITTEE,0,"With the UN now acting as if America must submit to its whims and decrees, it is more important than ever to understand how significant the implications of allowing this to continue would be. The whole notion that the UN was scheming to become a global government-style institution with centralized coercive powers was once dismissed as a \conspiracy theory\"" for \""kooks.\"" Today, it is obvious to anyone willing to pay attention to the news. As we reported in the companion article \""UN to America: We're the Boss,\"" the UN now regularly makes demands on America that fly in the face of traditional Americanism, across a broad range of crucial policy fields. And if left unchecked, this is only the start.\n\nUltimately, liberty, self-government, nation-states, and God-given rights will give way to total government if this is not stopped. And this is plain to see from the UN's own documents, statements, and agreements. Liberty is literally on the line, with globalists and the Deep State seeking to replace it with a fraud that sounds similar, at least at the most superficial level, but could not be more different in reality.\n\nAt the core of the UN's ongoing attacks against America is the drive to replace self-government under God and the God-given rights enshrined in America's founding documents with \""global governance\"" and UN-granted revocable privileges described by the UN as \""human rights.\"" And it is not exactly a secret. In fact, as The New American has documented extensively over a period of many years, the UN now brazenly and routinely claims that Americans' inalienable rights are actually violations of \""international human rights law,\"" and as such, must be drastically curtailed to comply with UN demands.\n\nIndeed, in the January 6, 2015 article headlined \""United Nations Exploits Pseudo-'Human Rights' to Attack U.S.,\"" The New American magazine documented this clearly with an array of examples. Among other concerns, the article gave multiple examples of the UN and its top officials publicly claiming that \""human rights\"" and \""international law\"" require that governments outlaw and punish certain speech, impose more gun control, ignore due-process protections, overturn state self-defense laws, eliminate constitutional limitations on federal power, prohibit spanking of children as a disciplinary tool, fund abortion with tax money, regulate private schools to comply with UN demands, provide more welfare and subsidized housing, and much, much more.\n\nAttacks on Free Speech, First Amendment\n\nSince the days of the Soviet Union's push to ban \""hate speech\"" internationally, the UN has been waging war on free speech. The UN actually claims international human rights law now requires nations to ban all sorts of speech -- basically, anything the UN deems hate, intolerance, discrimination, and so on. In 2014, for instance, two separate UN outfits, the dictator-dominated UN Human Rights Commission and the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, slammed Japan for not violating the free speech protections in its Constitution to ban speech, rallies, and groups that the UN considers \""hateful.\"" Even \""propaganda\"" that might \""incite discrimination or hostility\"" must be banned, the UN demanded of Japan, specifically targeting groups and rallies perceived as being \""Anti-Korean.\""\n\nThen UN Human Rights Czar Navi Pillay, a South African who condemned the United States after the killing of Trayvon Martin, offered some chilling insight into the dictator-dominated global body's views on the fundamental right to free speech. \""Defining the line that separates protected from unprotected speech is ultimately a decision that is best made after a thorough assessment of the circumstances of each case,\"" she argued. In other words, every time somebody speaks, they run the risk of violating the UN-backed restrictions on free speech. And in many nations, such outlandish international schemes are being cited as justification for jailing -- yes, jailing -- pastors, critics of Islam, critics of homosexuality, critics of mass migration, supporters of marriage, those who disagree with escalating gender confusion, and more.\n\nAfter the rally in Charlottesville over monuments that turned bloody, the UN openly called for free speech rights to be curtailed in America. In official statements, the UN said the U.S. government must \""provide the necessary guarantees so that such rights [free speech] are not misused to promote racist hate speech.\"" First, it will be \""racist hate speech.\"" Then, anything the UN and its member governments hate will be banned as \""hate speech,\"" as has occurred in so many nations. The UN also called on the U.S. government to wage a propaganda campaign that would \""actively contribute to the promotion of understanding, tolerance, and diversity between ethnic groups, and acknowledge their contribution to the history and diversity of the United States of America.\"" In other words, ban speech the UN dislikes, and use tax money to spread the UN's ideas.\n\nAttacks on Gun Rights, Second Amendment\n\nIt is not just free speech and freedom of the press that are in the UN's crosshairs. Gun rights are under threat, too. In 2016, after a jihadist with widely reported homosexual proclivities shot up a homosexual bar in Florida, the UN immediately interjected itself. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Hussein, an Islamic prince, claimed the U.S. government has an \""obligation\"" to implement \""robust gun regulation.\"" \""It is hard to find a rational justification that explains the ease with which people can buy firearms,\"" Hussein said, claiming that \""evidence\"" shows firearms make society less safe and that the U.S. government must intervene.\n\nTwo years earlier, a UN report on supposed human-rights abuses in America claimed the U.S. government must adopt more gun-control legislation, including gun registration, and remove self-defense rights. Countless similar statements and reports have been disgorged by the UN in recent years. In 2013, for example, the UN released a statement by \""experts\"" claiming the Obama administration was \""required\"" to \""amend, rescind, or nullify any laws or regulations which have the effect of creating or perpetuating racial discrimination.\"" Specifically, the UN was demanding an end to \""stand your ground\"" self-defense laws in Florida and other states, along with other laws protecting fundamental rights.\n\nAnd of course, as readers of this magazine know well, the global body has been working hard to force all nations to adopt draconian gun control through the UN Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). Among other claims, the treaty purports to grant a monopoly over weaponry to \""authorized state parties,\"" in other words to governments, ignoring the dangers signaled via the 300 million murders perpetrated by governments in the last century alone. Ammunition falls under the treaty's prohibitions, too. And in Article 5, the UN agreement commits all national governments to \""establish and maintain a national control system, including a national control list,\"" over \""the broadest range of conventional arms.\"" That means all of your guns are in the crosshairs.\n\nIt is hardly a pipe dream. In Venezuela, the UN helped socialist tyrant Hugo Ch�vez disarm civilians as part of a 2012 disarmament campaign that banned all private firearms. Speaking to regime-run \""reporters,\"" UN Coordinator for Venezuela Alfredo Missair urged them to actively support the gun ban. \""You are also responsible in this important fight -- we need the cooperation of not only the United Nations but of the media,\"" Missair said. \""So, we are offering all the support they require to do a good job.\"" Murder and crime rates promptly soared as the newly empowered regime stepped up its persecution of the opposition. Today, Venezuela has among the worst crime rates and the worst tyranny of any country on Earth.\n\nYet despite all that, the UN has plenty of friends in America who would love to see the same exact thing. In late 2017, Cook ENTITY Commissioner Richard Boykin went to New York City and asked the UN to send peacekeeping troops into Chicago to help deal with gun crime. \""I'm hoping to appeal to the UN to actually come to Chicago and meet with victims of violence, and maybe even possibly help out in terms of peacekeeping efforts, because I think it's so critical for us to make sure that these neighborhoods are safe,\"" Boykin was quoted as telling the press, claiming there was a \""genocide\"" going on against black Americans because most victims of shootings were black. \""So we must protect these population groups, and that's what the United Nations does. They're a peacekeeping force. They know all about keeping the peace, and so we're hopeful that they'll hear our appeal.\""\n\nAside from attacks on speech and gun rights, the UN also routinely denigrates America's federalist system of government. In direct violation of the 10th Amendment, which states that any powers not specifically given to the U.S. government remain the province of state governments or the people themselves, the UN has long been demanding that the U.S. government usurp all sorts of powers that were never delegated to it in order to comply with UN demands. It has also repeatedly derided the American justice system with its due process protections, presumption of innocence, trial by jury, and more. This was perhaps most extreme in the wake of the Trayvon Martin shooting, but continues to this day. Under the guise of fighting \""terrorism\"" and \""crime\"" and other issues, the UN now routinely demands all sorts of abuses of privacy, too, including global biometric databases, national biometric IDs, support from Big Tech to censor and spy on citizens, and much more.\n\nIn short, there are no fundamental rights enjoyed by Americans that the UN does not seek to eliminate.\n\nUN's \""Human Rights\"": Homosexual \""Marriage,\"" Government Control\n\nBy contrast, the UN celebrated the Supreme Court's usurpation of power to invent a right to a \""homosexual marriage\"" as a great leap forward in human rights. \""I whole-heartedly welcome this historic decision,\"" then-UN boss Ban said in San Francisco about Obergefell while commemorating the 70th anniversary of the signing of the UN Charter. \""This is a great step forward for human rights in the United States.\"" In a speech given that same day at a lunch for the UN pro-homosexuality and -transgender campaign \""free and equal,\"" Ban celebrated June 26 as \""a day we celebrate not only the birth of the United Nations but marriage equality for all Americans.\""\n\nThe UN's legions of discredited \""special rapporteurs,\"" meanwhile, have long made clear that they view \""rights\"" in the same way the regimes enslaving the people of the Soviet Union, Cuba, Vietnam, China, and other communist nations have viewed rights. In the United Kingdom, for example, a UN special rapporteur infamous for sacrificing an animal to Karl Marx was relentlessly ridiculed for accusing the U.K. government of \""human rights violations\"" because welfare recipients were not being given large enough houses. In Switzerland, UN bureaucrats attacked stay-at-home mothers as human-rights violators. In Canada, they claimed supposedly \""low\"" taxes were a \""human rights\"" violation because the government needed more resources to battle everything from obesity to inequality.\n\nThere is a method to the madness (See sidebar on page 36). The UN's vision of human rights for the world is exactly the opposite of the views held by America's Founding Fathers that produced the greatest and freest nation in history -- not to mention the moral code outlined in the Bible that is at the core of Western civilization. As explained in the Declaration of Independence, the Founders said it was self-evident that God had created people and endowed them with unalienable rights such as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They also said governments exist to protect those unalienable rights. The Founders literally viewed rights as a sacred gift from God, as they explained repeatedly.\n\nThe UN, by contrast, believes that governments and international agreements confer privileges that can be revoked at any time for little to no cause. In Article 29 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for instance, the document makes clear that rights can be limited by law under virtually any pretext. It also says that the alleged rights may \""in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\"" In other words, individuals have no unalienable rights under the UN's view of human rights, only privileges that can be revoked at will by governments and international organizations.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Council, meanwhile, is literally dominated by dictatorships, with unfree regimes holding the majority of seats. The predecessor organ-ization, the UN Human Rights Committee, was once led by the late Libyan tyrant Moammar Gadhafi. And current UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet is a known supporter of socialism and even mass-murdering communist dictatorships such as the Castro regime enslaving Cuba. In her younger years, as victims were being slaughtered trying to flee East Germany, she defected to that mass-murdering communist regime. She recently praised the \""squad\"" of fringe left-wing congresswomen (AOC et al.) famous for hating America and Trump. \""I believe that those four women are fantastic,\"" she said, describing them as \""bright\"" and celebrating their alleged courage \""to say what they think\"" about supposed U.S. deficiencies.\n\nNor does the UN itself respect even the most fundamental rights of people. According to the organization Hear Their Cries, UN troops and international aid workers and bureaucrats have raped and sexually exploited over 60,000 women and children just in the last decade. A poll conducted by the non-profit Save the Children revealed that just in the Ivorian town of Toulepleu, which was occupied by UN peace troops, eight out of 10 minor girls admitted to regularly being raped and forced into sexual acts by UN soldiers. Unspeakable horrors perpetrated by the UN's \""blue helmets\"" have been documented from Africa and Asia to Europe and the Americas and everywhere in between. And yet, because of \""diplomatic immunity,\"" there has been virtually no accountability at all.\n\nThe hypocrisy of the UN's supposed quest for human rights in America is perhaps most perfectly illustrated in its hypocrisy over Communist China. While the United States is constantly under fire, the regime in Beijing does not just get a pass -- top UN officials bend over backward to protect the mass-murdering dictatorship from criticism. Consider the recent case at the UN Human Rights Council, where a coalition of more than 120 organizations sought to file a formal complaint against Beijing's network of \""re-education\"" camps holding well over a million Uighur Muslims, but was prevented from even publishing a formal complaint at the UN Human Rights Council, in violation of its own procedures. Before that, a top UN \""human rights\"" official was exposed by a whistleblower handing straight to Beijing the names of Chinese dissidents seeking to testify against the regime. The whistleblower was persecuted, while the highest echelons of the UN worked to cover up the whole matter by firing judges and suppressing the facts.\n\nUN Seeking to Become Global Government\n\nUltimately, the globalist goal is to turn the UN into a global government that would actively deny individual rights -- one that could not be effectively resisted by its victims. It already has courts, armies, self-styled \""law enforcement\"" and \""crime fighting\"" divisions, and much more. Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon repeatedly referred to the UN as the \""Parliament of Humanity.\"" A parliament, by definition, is a law-making body of a government. Before that, Ban referred to the UN Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals -- essentially a roadmap to global technocratic government -- as the planetary \""declaration of interdependence.\"" The head of the UN General Assembly when the scheme was adopted, Peter Thompson, referred to it as a \""master-plan for humanity.\""\n\nThis has been the objective from the start, when U.S. diplomat (and Soviet agent) Alger Hiss led the conference to create the UN. Among those involved in the process who have admitted the goal was John Foster Dulles, a leading Deep State globalist who also helped create the UN and went on to become U.S. secretary of state. \""The United Nations represents not a final stage in the development of world order, but only a primitive stage,\"" he wrote in his book War or Peace. \""Therefore its primary task is to create the conditions which will make possible a more highly developed organization.\"" Dulles also observed in his book, \""I have never seen any proposal made for collective security with 'teeth' in it, or for 'world government' or for 'world federation,' which could not be carried out either by the United Nations or under the United Nations Charter.\""\n\nUnder President Trump, there have been some efforts to rein in the UN, including leaving some UN agencies. There have also been some tepid efforts to reverse the perverted UN view of human rights. This summer, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo created a commission to deal with the corruption of discourse about human rights. Dubbed the \""Commission on Unalienable Rights,\"" the body was tasked with recommending \""reforms of human rights discourse where it has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights.\"" It was a nice thought. But the commission was endlessly demonized and mocked by glob-alists and totalitarians, and it is not clear that it will accomplish much, if anything.\n\nThe real solution to the UN's escalating attacks on American ENTITY and liberty must involve getting out of the UN, something The John Birch Society, which publishes this magazine, has been advocating for over 50 years. Legislation to do that is in Congress already. One of the sponsors of the American ENTITY Restoration Act (HR 204), Representative Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), has been a leader in the campaign for an #Amexit from the UN. He told The New American in an interview last year that there are many reasons why the U.S. government should get out of the globalist institution.\n\n\""The best thing that you can say about the United Nations is it's mostly ineffective and a waste of money,\"" said Congressman Massie, who started campaigning for an \""Amexit\"" from the UN after the British people voted for a \""Brexit\"" from the European Union. \""That's the best thing you can say about it. So I'm glad that they are somewhat ineffective, but I don't like that we waste the money.\"" But that is just the start. \""It's full of dictators, and it's also something that I don't think our sovereign government should defer to,\"" he explained. \""For instance, a lot of these foreign relations bills that come in front of us in Congress and the whereas clauses -- they might say 'whereas the UN has said this,' or 'the UN decided this, now therefore be it resolved' -- well that's almost an automatic no for me, because why would I defer to the United Nations if we're a sovereign country?\""\n\nMassie also noted that many of his colleagues love the UN and would like to see the United States even more deeply ensnared within its grasp. And therein lies the problem. These members of Congress were elected by ignorant Americans who do not understand their own heritage, their freedoms, or the existential threat posed to them by the dictators club. As such, beyond simply ending U.S. membership in the UN, Americans must educate the electorate. Absolutely essential to that mission will be restoring a proper public understanding on the nature of rights, the role of government, the U.S. Constitution, and the danger of phony ideas on \""human rights\"" that require the government to redistribute wealth extracted from others by force. Without that understanding, even an #Amexit would be only a temporary solution. By getting involved in the JBS campaign to \""Get U.S. Out of the United Nations,\"" you can join with others and turn the tide today.\n\nPhoto credit: AP Images"

KARNES,0,"While HBO is credited with groundbreaking programming that changed television, it's easy to forget that FX was there, too. It's still changing television with shows like Atlanta, Pose, American Crime Story and Fosse/Verdon.\n\nBut when FX launched in 1994, it was the scrappy sister to the premium companies. That was back when all anyone knew about the channel was its tagline. Its first three series efforts -- none of which you remember -- were canceled within the year. But in 2002, FX hit its stride and began producing series that would become among the last of appointment TV before DVRs and Netflix.\n\nSo put down that Roku remote and recall some of the original FX shows that helped change off-network television.\n\nThe Shield\n\nAs an actor, Michael Chiklis doesn't get enough credit from going from the lovable Tony Scali in ABC's The Commish to Vic Mackey, who would have probably killed Scali and framed someone else for it. The Shield centered around Mackey: a cop and the leader of the Strike Team, a good cop (in the sense that he got results) and a bad cop in essentially every other way. You need a confession out of an accused child molester? Give Mackey five minutes and a telephone book.\n\nAs much as network television pushed the envelope with police dramas, The Shield started out with a bang and kept the momentum going. In the first episode, one of the Strike Team members is shot and killed by Vic Mackey himself, so it set the pace for future off-network dramas. Anything -- and anyone -- could go. Mackey and the team are set upon throughout the series by criminals, other officers and, finally, themselves.\n\nBy the show's conclusion, it had drawn the likes of Glenn Close (remember that name) and Forest Whitaker as guest stars. The supporting cast was pretty good, too: CCH Pounder's Claudette Wyms was the Strike Team foil for all seven seasons, and then there was Dutch Wagenbach (played by Jay ENTITY), who may or may not have been very close to pursuing a life as a killer.\n\nNip/Tuck\n\nTwo friends open a plastic surgery practice together. One is a single, handsome, freewheeling guy who has had a very robust sex life in the past. The other is a family man whose son looks nothing like him -- but does have the features of his best friend and business partner.\n\nThat sounds like a basic premise, but it turned out that Nip/Tuck, the first vehicle done for FX by Ryan Murphy (who is now a writer for Pose), relied heavily on shock value. And it worked. There were the realistic-looking surgery scenes, the sex scenes, the guest stars (among them the late Joan Rivers, playing herself, as a patient who wanted the main characters to undo all the plastic surgery she'd had) and the plot lines, which were, in a word, wild. There were serial killers, and there were love triangles that became love octagons.\n\nNip/Tuck got a lot of attention from a storyline featuring one of the first transgender characters. Unfortunately, Famke Janssen's Ava Moore was also a baby abductor and definitely a child molester.\n\nDamages\n\nThis series put Rose Byrne on the map, and because of this show, it can still be a little unbelievable to watch her in rom-coms. In Damages, Byrne was cast opposite Glenn Close, and they spent the entire series trying to basically kill each other.\n\nClose was Patty Hewes, a lawyer who would do anything to win a case, and Byrne was Ellen Parsons, who was handpicked by Hewes as the newest addition to her firm. It doesn't take long to figure out why, which marked the beginning of the cat-and-mouse game Patty and Ellen would play for the next five seasons.\n\nEach season focused on a high-profile case that often featured stories stolen from recent headlines. There was also a deep roster of guest stars, including Ted Danson, Martin Short, William Hurt, Chris Messina and John Goodman. Close, Byrne and the show racked up awards in response to the strong showing.\n\nOf course, there were previous legal dramas that showed lawyers as unscrupulous puppeteers, but this was way beyond L.A. law. Patty resorted to means that seemed as if it would often be easier to just try the case, but why argue when you can watch Close and Byrne outfox each other instead?\n\nNafari VanaskiNafari Vanaski is a freelance writer for Adweek."
ABDELMALEK,1,"Commentary by Arezki Daoud: Algeria has been plagued by widespread corruption ever since Bouteflika became president in 1999. All the men and women he hired essentially set out to restructure the legal system to protect their interests, and created bureaucratic practices that enabled them to institutionalize corruption in unprecedented ways never seen anywhere else in the world.\n\nThe scale of corruption in Algeria was (is) such that it is almost impossible to find an official that has been in office from 1999 to 2019 who has clean hands. So much so that while the 1990s are dubbed \the dark decade\"" due to the civil war that claimed tens of thousands of lives, the Bouteflika reign should be dubbed \""the two decades of deep corruption.\"" Corruption practices used over the past 20 years include the classic and disgusting practice of demanding a commission on projects, imposing an equity partner on a business created by either another Algerian national or a foreign company, all the way to confiscating the lands and properties legitimately owned by individuals and families for the pleasure of the corrupt official.\n\nCorruption has been widespread, not just at the very top level, with ministers and state-own company CEOs milking the system, but smaller-scaled corruption was the de-facto culture in provincial (Wali) and local governments. Anyone with power, at any level, had to engage in extortion and other acts deemed criminal in normal societies. If you needed a simple birth certificate, you were at the mercy of a tiny clerk, demand bribes. This was the norm in Algeria. It was instituted by the Bouteflika clan, defended by Grand Viziers like Prime Ministers Ahmed Ouyahia and ENTITY, and practiced by everyone so as to divvy up the oil revenue. As for those small bribes in city halls, they were meant to keep the little people busy. Normal governance and management were non existent and that's why Algeria is where it is today, in a deep political crisis.\n\nThe current crisis and one of the main reasons why Algerian leaders are not willing to move to the next step is largely due to the fact that many of the men who form the Military Command in charge of the country today, are also deeply corrupt. They cannot fathom or accept the idea of letting it go altogether, or face the same predicament as those who are now behind bars. Algerian generals have long ruled like emperors in their fiefdoms. The country is divided into several so-called military regions, with each region having its general in charge of security. These men reported to no-one, as if they were warlords. They have always been and still are above and beyond the law. And, as part of the culture, nothing happens in their regions without their consent, and often that means commission payments, gifts, and so many other way to enrich themselves. In addition to the region's chiefs there are the commanders who oversee the various branches of the military, from the army to air force, and from the navy to intelligence, give or take 24 of them in today's Command who are frightened by what may happen to them should the rule of law prevail.\n\nThese men are powerful, unwilling to compromise, and without a reasonable strategy to save the republic. They still think that they invulnerable and untouchable, just like the mighty previous Ministers of Oil thought of themselves. Just like the Prime Ministers in prison, one of these oil ministers has been sent to the notorious Harrach prison over this past weekend. Not too long ago, Youcef Yousfi was the king of the industrial sector in Algeria, more powerful than his bosses, wining and dining with the most powerful global corporations, hedge fund managers, leaders of the IMF and World Bank, and government officials around the world. That myth of the all-powerful minister is over. Yousfi is alleged by Algerian prosecutors to have squandered public funds. But Algerians are waiting for another notorious figure of the Bouteflika reign, the president's very own friend Chakib Khelil, ex-oil Minister who has been accused by both Algerian and European courts of corruption. While he was once favored to replace President Bouteflika, Khelil is not in Algeria, having fled, fearing justice. It is unclear whether he is a US citizen or a green card holder, but he is likely in the Gulf, a region that has no problem sponsoring dictators and thugs from Idi Amin Dada to Zine el-Abidin Ben Ali. They used them well. If he is a US citizen, then he may even be in breach of US law banning US citizens from serving another government and he will have to face the US Justice Department on this.\n\nIn addition to demanding that the likes of Khelil return home to face justice, Algerians will be expecting from the judiciary to reactivate the cases involving the misdeeds and illegal activities of the many foreign companies that have help perpetuate the state of chaos in Algeria. Canada's SNC Lavalin and many Italian firms have been named in court cases in Algeria, Italy and elsewhere and have yet to face their accusers in an Algerian court. But that day will only come after the military command surrenders power to a civilian government.\n\nAlgiers, July 14, 2019 (AFP) - Algeria's former industry minister was placed in provisional detention Sunday on allegations of squandering public money, state television reported. Youcef Yousfi is the latest among a series of prominent politicians and businessmen to be detained or questioned in connection with corruption since longtime leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned in April in the face of mass protests against his rule.\n\nYousfi, who served between 2017 and 2019, is under investigation for graft and is suspected among other things of \""squandering public funds\"" as well as \""abuse of power and conflict of interest\"", the state broadcaster said. He was placed under preventive detention by the supreme court's investigating magistrate, it said."
ABDELMALEK,0,"The newly-appointed Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the Democratic People's Republic of Algeria Hossein Mashalchizadeh held a series of meetings with Algeria's high-ranked officials with a view to explore avenues for bolstering and reinvigorating all-out bilateral cooperation.\n\nThe Iranian Diplomat held a meeting with the Algerian Commerce Minister Said Djelab, during which both sides put forward the deep and solid friendship between the two brotherly countries, expressing the will of their countries to further work for their consolidation and strengthening, especially in the economic field in the best interests of both peoples.\n\nWelcoming the level of bilateral cooperation in the various spheres, both officials noted that this cooperation has initiated a new era given the deep links binding both countries, wishing its promotion at a higher level, through the conclusion of joint projects as well as the exchange of expertises and experiences as well as the participation of both countries' delegations at exhibitions promoting local products.\n\nIn the same vein, the Iranian Envoy met with the Minister of Communication, Government's Spokesman and Acting Minister of Culture, Hassan Rebahi.\n\nAfter highlighting the fraternal relations between Algeria and Iran, both sides called for the intensification of efforts to further promote cooperation at the highest level, in accordance with the will of the leaders of the two countries and on the basis of their converging positions on numbers of causes.\n\nWith respect to communication aspect, they welcomed the level of the cooperation binding both countries, highlighting the need to further expand media cooperation and the exchange of press technology and expertise between both countries given the great role assigned to news agencies in terms of helping to realize a better knowledge of others in order to overcome the great deficiency in Muslim world, especially nowadays when our world is facing biased media of the World Arrogance and need to make more efforts to introduce and prove righteousness of its positions.\n\nHighlighting the potentials and energies of these countries, they called to speed up the pace of exchange of delegations of journalists, adding that the exchange of information in both countries can provide fertile ground for the development of cultural and diplomatic ties as well as scientific, economic, commercial and cultural cooperation, which is supported by the existence of common will among the leaders of the two countries. The spotlight was placed also on the need to ink MoUs between both countries' news agencies.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that National news agency Algeria Press Service (APS) and Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) signed, in 2018, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on news exchange.\n\nThe Memorandum of Understanding was signed by \APS\"" Director General, Abdelhamid Kacha, and IRNA Agency Director General, Seyed Zia Hach�mi.\n\nDuring the signing ceremony, both parties agreed to exchange information services (information, photos, videos and computer graphics) as well as to carry out joint projects, affirming that grounds for expansion of professional cooperation between the two news agencies are well prepared.\n\nBefore the signing ceremony, IRNA agency Director General paid a visit to the various departments of the APS, where he received explanations on the activities of the Agency and the processing of information, meanwhile, MR. Hashemi expressed his admiration for the \""organization\"" of these services.\n\nOn the other hand, Algerian delegations frequently pay visits to Iran with a view to usher in good cooperation between the two media for strengthening and expanding Iran-Algeria relations.\n\nThe opening of IRNA bureau in Algeria was, repeatedly, arisen by Algerian visiting delegations. Director General of the Algerian news agency APS Abdelhamid Kacha, Managing Director of 'Al-Khabar\"" newspaper Kamal Jouzi and Managing Director of \""Al-Khabar \""TV network Ali Jari, stressed, in different visits, that the opening of IRNA news bureau in Algiers and the exchange of reporters and media persons will help broaden cultural affinities between the two sides.\n\nAs long as culture is concerned, the Iranian Diplomat and the Algerian Acting Culture Minister hailed the cultural cooperation exiting between both countries, calling for its broadening into other fields such as; theater, music and literature.\n\nA movie on Ahmed Bey (c. 1784-1850), the last Ottoman ruler of Algiers is co-produced by Algeria and Iran. Iranian filmmaker Jamal Shurjeh is the film's director and the costumes and film sets have been designed by Iranian experts. The Iranian cineaste Danesh Eqbashavi, is, also, collaborating on the film, directing the war scenes for \""Ahmed Bey\"". An Iranian team will give consultation on the stunt, make-up, shooting and sound-on-film.\n\nThe film, depicting Ahmed Bey's life from 1826 to 1848 when he ruled the Regency of Algiers, laid grounds for more cooperation between Tehran and Algiers in various fields related to cinema and arts.\n\nThis experience is highly appreciated by the Algerian side, as expressed by the former Culture Minister Azzedine Mihoubi, who considered this joint project of film-making with Iran as an opportunity for getting familiar with the Iranian cinema style as well as exchanging cultural knowledge between the two countries.\n\nAlgeria, for its part, is eager to introduce Algerian culture and art to Iranian people, participating in different exhibitions, lastly few months ago, an Algerian Cultural Exhibition was held at Melal Cultural Center, with a view to make people of the two countries more familiar with each other's cultures, customs and traditions. Works of visual and traditional arts (Watercolor, oil paint, acrylic painting, miniature, painting on sand, ceramic panels, etc.) and handicraft were displayed, illustrating to Iranians the historical aspects and life of the people of Algeria.\n\nOn the other hand, different Iranian cultural exhibitions took place in Algeria to get the Algerians familiar with Iran's culture and art.\n\nSeveral major cultural and art fairs are frequently organized by Iran's embassy in Algeria, such as: the one held last year in Blida province, located about 45 km south-west of Algiers, and 10th Intl. Festival of Calligraphy, Miniatures Exhibition with prominent Iranian artists in attendance, where they were warmly honored.\n\nScreening Iranian films and documentaries, holding calligraphy workshops, performing Iranian music, introducing Iranian food and confectionery, introducing Iranian science, tourism and historical attractions and displaying films are always on the agendas of the exhibitions' programs, international book fairs and cultural weeks which help the two nations get more acquainted with the cultural identity and tradition of one another.\n\nLast May, Algerians discovered for a week the Iranian movies following a government initiative to diversify cinematographic products. An Iranian Film Week was held in Algeria in order to present Persian culture and cinema to the African country's public.\n\nProminent Iranian film directors, namely; Seyyed Reza Mirkarimi and Kamal Tabrizi attended the event where a number of Iranian films were screened; such as; A Cube of Sugar by Reza Mirkarimi, About Eli by Asghar Farhadi, A Piece of Bread by Kamal Tabrizi and Mainline by Rakhshan Bani-Etemad. Different cultural panels about Iranian cinema were also held on the sidelines of the event with Algerian directors and producers.\n\nThe Iranian Ambassador was received, also, by the Minister of Relations with Parliament Fathi Khouil. During their meeting, both sides emphasized the need to boost parliamentary cooperation through the exchange of delegations and the activation of Algeria-Iran parliamentary friendship group, reiterating that parliamentary diplomacy can help reinforcing peace and stability and fostering talks to remove tensions and settle the regional crises.\n\nOn January 10, 2019, Algeria-Iran parliamentary friendship group was set up at the headquarters of Algeria's People's National Assembly ( Parliament's Lower House) in Algiers with a view to consolidate and strengthen parliamentary relations in accordance with the provisions of a framework for joint activities, especially in the parliamentary arena.\n\nFor his part, Algerian Religious Affairs and Endowment Minister Youssef Belmahdi granted the Iranian Diplomat a meeting, during which both sides hailed the brotherly relations between the two Muslim countries, underlining the necessity of strengthening them in various fields.\n\nThe religious cooperation and exchange between both countries is experiencing a glare with meetings between religious scholars from Algeria and Iran taking place frequently. Earlier, an agreement was inked, in Algiers, between the President of High Islamic Council, Bouabdellah Ghlamallah, and Iran's Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, Reza Salehi Amiri, which aimed at finding means of preventing and fighting Takfiri and extremist groups, as well as rescuing the Islamic world from the crisis being experienced.\n\nIn addition, Algeria expresses admiration for Tehran's International Holy Quran Exhibition held each year, describing it as a big, major religious display in the global arena that has contributed to Muslims solidarity.\n\n'The Zionist regime's plots against the Muslim world have caused division among the Muslim countries; however, the Islamic Republic of Iran has played a role in making the Muslim nations united by holding an international exhibition of Holy Quran,' Algerian Ambassador to Iran Abdel Moun'aam Ahriz told the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).\n\nBesides, hand-woven Persian carpets covering an area of 12,000 square meters are decorating the Grand Mosque of Algiers (world's third largest mosque, also known Djamaa El Djazair mosque, to be completed in Algeria).\n\nEarlier, Algeria's the then Minister of Religious Affairs and Endowments Mohamed Aissa said that his ministry received the first batch of the carpets, made up of 539 pieces at the end of 2014, in a contractual framework with the Waqfs or Endowments Foundation.\n\nAccording to IRNA news agency, the carpets were purchased by an Algerian businessman with a price tag of �6 million from Iranian cities of Naeen and Kashan with a view to add a unique touch to this tremendous cultural and architectural project.\n\nEarlier and following the handing of his credentials, His Excellency Hossein Mashalchizadeh held a meeting with the Algerian Head of State Abdelkader Bensalah, during which, he described relations binding Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Algeria as friendly, emphasizing the determination of the Islamic Republic for strengthening and expanding relations in various fields with Algiers.\n\nFor his part, Bensaleh conveyed his warmest greetings to his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhan, wishing evermore success for the ambassador in his new post in line with strengthening bilateral ties.\n\nThe Iranian Ambassador held another meeting with the foreign Minister Sabri Boukadoum, during which bilateral relations and means to further boost them in the best interests of the two brotherly countries and peoples have been reviewed. In addition, the latest developments in the region have been discussed.\n\nMashalchizadeh replaced Reza Ameri, former Iranian Ambassador to Algeria.\n\nIran and Algeria enjoy constructive relations with bilateral cooperation increasing since the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries in September 2000. Former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad expressed, in 2007, Iran's determination to remove all obstacles to developing economic ties between Iran and Algeria.\n\nOver 2008, bilateral trade between Algeria and Iran doubled from $25 million in 2007 to $50 million. In addition to bilateral trade in commercial good, Iran and Algeria have inked up to 70 agreements and MoUs in different fields, to wit, inter alia, energy, industry, banking, agricultural industries, mining, energy, justice, education, tourism, and art.. etc.\n\nIran and Algeria, respectively the world's second and seventh largest natural gas reserve holders also want to share expertise in various areas of gas including production, marketing and the liquefied natural gas (LNG) business.\n\nTalks were launched to buy Algeria's phosphate, a move welcomed by the Algerian side as the then Algerian Energy Minister Yousfi responded favorably, proposing that companies in both countries get together to discuss the details in order to reach agreements to facilitate the exporting of Algerian phosphate to Iran.\n\nIn July 2008, Iran and Algeria announced plans to build a joint cement plant in Algeria worth nearly $300 million, thus greatly increasing their industrial cooperation.\n\nWith respect to automotive industry, many agreements between the Algerian group Tahkout and Iranian car manufacturer Saipa for the establishment of a great complex, with an implementation cost amounts USD 300 to million, made up of fifteen factories in Tiaret, west of Algiers, were inked.\n\nThe Iranian party is contributing with its technological expertise in the manufacturing of cars running on CGN.\n\nAnother automotive industry agreement has been signed between private group Rahmouni and Khodro manufacturer for the assembling of cars in Algeria.\n\nBesides, Iran's major tire producer Yazd Tire concluded an export deal with Renault's Algerian operations to export 50,000 tires produced by the company in central Iran to Algeria.\n\nFurthermore and covering different fields, a draft agreement between Algeria's Geological Survey Agency and its Iranian counterpart was inked to establish a cooperation framework in the mining research.\n\nIn this regard, the Algerian standardization institute (IANOR) signed a draft agreement with its Iranian counterpart to ease trade exchange between Algeria and Iran while bringing closer both countries' standards.\n\nThe Algerian Company of Fairs and Exhibitions (Safex) and the Iranian Agency for Foreign Trade signed an agreement to facilitate Algeria's participation in Iranian exhibitions and shows, and vice-versa.\n\nA MoU on the production of drugs and medical equipment was signed by the then Director of Pharmacy and Medical Equipment at the ministry of Health, Population and the Hospital Reform Hamou Hafedh and Iran's Deputy-Minister and President of the Organization of Food and Drugs Rasoul Dinar Kand. It relates to the manufacturing of vaccines and serums in Algeria.\n\nAnother MoU was inked from the Algerian side by the then Director General of Frater-Razes Labs Abdelhamid Cherfaoui and from the Iranian side by Director of Baboush lab Darou Khir Abadi on the manufacturing of biotech drugs.\n\nIn 2017, eight cooperation deals, covering different fields, were inked during the Second Joint Iran-Algeria Economic Cooperation Commission presided by First Vice President Es'haq Jahangiri and Algerian Prime Minister ENTITY Salal with a number of the two countries' cabinets in attendance.\n\nThe first deal signed by the two sides pertains to education. Other documents included cooperation agreement between the two countries' youth and sports ministries during 2015-2017, technical collaboration deal between their labor ministries as well as cultural cooperation deal between the culture ministries.\n\nThe two countries' higher education and justice ministries also signed relevant deals.\n\nRelations between central banks of the two countries picked up in the recent years coinciding with the exchange between high-ranking banking officials from Iran and Algeria. At present, central banks of the two countries are interrelated and obstacles related to issuing purchase and sale contracts have been removed through serious follow-ups.\n\nAs regards tourism; some Iranian travel agencies are in touch with their Algerian counterparts with a view to boost tourism cooperation for the acquaintance of the two nations with each other's history and civilization.\n\nPolitically, Iran and Algeria hold regular talks on bilateral, regional and international issues. Regular meetings between the two foreign ministries' officials, high-ranked delegations within the framework of relations and regular consultations are taking place. Their brotherly relations are deeply rooted and go back to the 1960s. Soon after Algeria's independence from France in 1962, Iran was among the first countries to recognize it as an independent nation, opening the Iranian embassy in autumn of 1964, in Algiers.\n\nFor its part, Algeria, as a mediator, led the initiative to address the border dispute between Iran and Iraq in 1975. It hosted a meeting with the Iranian and Iraqi officials in attendance that led to the signing of a deal known as \""the Algiers Agreement\"".\n\nFollowing the victory of 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, bilateral ties between the two nations developed and the two countries intensified meetings and exchanges culminating in the adoption of similar stances on an array of international issues, particularly the problems faced by the World of Islam like the ones in Palestine and Syria. Algeria is one of countries which have independent positions close to those of Iran on many issues, including in terms of its political literature.\n\nAnother accord was inked between Iran and the USA due to the mediation of Algeria during the US embassy takeover in Tehran. Algiers Accord became another cause for better ties between Iran and Algeria. However, both counties' relations experienced some ups and downs. Yet, in the wake of the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000, Tehran and Algiers resumed diplomatic relations and since then these relations keep flourishing, maintaining common approaches to regional and international issues. Algeria opposed the Arab League members on giving the Syrian seat in the League to the Syrian opposition, and Algiers resisted taking any kind of military action in Syria, and as for Hezbollah and Hamas, Algeria objected putting their names on the terrorist group list in the Arab League.\n\nSince the very beginning of the nuclear talks and even before the conclusion of the JCPOA, Algeria was positive about Iran's peaceful nuclear activities and constantly and explicitly defended Iran's right in international bodies. Following the implementation of the nuclear deal finalized by Iran and six world powers in July 2015, known as the JCPOA, Algeria considered the deal as an important stage in the process of the settlement of the tension and crisis situations, in a view to preserving international peace and security, and development in the benefit of all the peoples.\n\nAlgiers had, in 2015, received the first vice president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Eshaq Jahangiri, just after expressing refusal to join the Saudi coalition. The beginning of a deeper cooperation between the two countries is, therefore, also a clear message sent to Riyadh: Algiers wants to diversify its cooperation with Iran, avoiding getting into a diplomatic game that would be dictated by the Americans. Iran's Hassan Rouhani said the two countries have always backed each other in difficult times and today, whereas the Algerian side stressed that Tehran-Algiers relations would witness further expansion in all domains during the new Algerian administration's tenure."
ABU ZUBAYDAH,1,"A former commander of the most secretive part of the prison compound told how the accused plotters of the Sept. 11 attacks were guarded by a secret force dressed like U.S. troops.\n\nThis article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\n\nGUANT�NAMO BAY, Cuba -- In the months after their arrival at Guant�namo in 2006 from years in C.I.A. detention, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and the other accused plotters of the Sept. 11 attacks were guarded by a secret force disguised as United States troops and kept isolated in individual cells, unable to communicate with each other, a former commander testified Friday.\n\nThe account of their early days at Guant�namo emerged in a pretrial hearing on Friday in the case of Mr. Mohammed and four other men accused of conspiring in the 2001 attacks. The commander's testimony amounted to the most comprehensive view yet of Guant�namo's most mysterious prison, known as Camp 7, and the secret unit, called Task Force Platinum, that has guarded it since its inception.\n\nLawyers for Mr. Mohammed and the other defendants want the judge to exclude from their death-penalty trial, scheduled to start in January 2021, what they told F.B.I. agents in early 2007, months after they got to Guant�namo. The defense lawyers say those interrogations -- carried out by what prosecutors say were \clean teams\"" from the F.B.I. who were unfamiliar with evidence unlawfully obtained from the defendants during the years they were in C.I.A. custody and subject to torture -- were in fact tainted by years of clandestine C.I.A.-F.B.I. collaboration.\n\nThe defense lawyers argue that the prisoners provided the same answers to F.B.I. agents in 2007 that they had previously given to the C.I.A. at black sites where they were punished for not cooperating, and did not believe, based on conditions at Guant�namo, that they had free choice to refuse.\n\nTo rebut the defense, prosecutors on Friday called the former Army officer who served as the first commander of Camp 7. He testified about how he took custody of the accused Sept. 11 plotters and other C.I.A. prisoners as they came off a C-17 cargo plane in the dark of night at Guant�namo in September 2006 and, starting four months later, had his troops shepherd them to the F.B.I. interrogations.\n\nThe prisoners were told on the eve of an interrogation that they had an appointment the following day, which they could chose to attend. The commander said he never told them they were to be F.B.I. interrogations but checked with them the next morning on whether they would go to the appointments. They took place at a portion of the Guant�namo prison compound called Camp Echo II.\n\nThe former Army officer, who came to court in a sports jacket and tie, testified anonymously at the insistence of case prosecutors. He described a security regime set up by the Bush administration in September 2006 as it acknowledged to the world, for the first time, that it had held and interrogated prisoners in secret sites around the world starting in 2002.\n\nAccounts of the violence the C.I.A. used in the black sites -- waterboarding, beatings, sleep deprivation, rectal abuse and hanging their captives by their wrists -- would emerge later.\n\nOnce at Guant�namo, according to the Camp 7 commander, the 14 prisoners were taken to their new cells, showered and provided with \""fresh clothes.\"" The prisoners included Mr. Mohammed as well as a Saudi man now awaiting a capital trial as the accused mastermind of Al Qaeda's 2000 bombing of the U.S.S. Cole warship of Yemen and a never-charged Palestinian man known as ENTITY, who was the first detainee to be waterboarded in C.I.A. custody.\n\nMost of the commander's testimony on Friday occurred in a hearing closed to journalists because prosecutors invoked a national security privilege over much of the information about how the prison was set up and who worked there.\n\nFor example, the former commander was forbidden to describe in open court what the 14 former black site captives were wearing or how they looked when they arrived in 2006. Nor did he explain in his testimony why the guards who worked for him on the cellblocks wore United States military uniforms but were not employees of the Defense Department, a remark that suggested they were C.I.A. agents or contractors disguised as soldiers. Their uniforms bore no ranks and had pseudonyms where their names belonged.\n\nThe former commander also said he disagreed with a finding of a Senate Intelligence Committee that Camp 7 was \""under the operational control of the C.I.A.\"" He said he worked directly for the overall Guant�namo detention center commander at the time, Rear Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr. of the Navy.\n\nDuring their first Ramadan at Guant�namo, the commander said, the Camp 7 prisoners ate alone, prayed alone and had no contact with each other. A recorded prayer call piped through a speaker system announced prayer times.\n\nThe prison provided them with halal meals, which the guards delivered by opening two doors leading to their cells and then unlocked a slot in the innermost door.\n\nIn time, they were allowed to exit the back door of their cell to an enclosed recreation yard that has been described as a cell made of chain-linked fencing surrounded by camouflage netting with a restricted view of foliage on one side. Later, the Pentagon sent word that the prisoners could have recreation time in pairs, in separate cells.\n\nA lead prosecutor, Robert Swann, disclosed for the first time during the hearing that an F.B.I. agent came to Guant�namo in November 2007 with an unusual request for the guard force. The agent got permission to bring a six- to eight-inch hair brush to an interrogation of Mr. Mohammed to photograph him holding it.\n\nThe anonymous Camp 7 commander said the agent was photographing how Mr. Mohammed \""held the brush\"" to \""compare it to the time when he had a weapon in his hand to murder someone.\"" Mr. Swann said that the agent was trying to establish if the hand that held the brush matched the hand of a man on a videotape beheading Daniel Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter, in Pakistan in 2002.\n\nMr. Mohammed has never been charged with killing Mr. Pearl, although Pakistan prosecuted several other men for the kidnapping and killing"
ABU SAYYAF GROUP,1,"Before we begin, for those who are not intelligence specialists, these axioms must be, if not learned, at least introduced.\n\nBehind the curtain exists a Deep State, a world super-government that will minimally influence and in most cases control national governments.\n\nGovernments are controlled to control resources, to manipulate markets through manufactured needs and shortages, through currencies, though militarization and humanity is little but fodder, tolerated only so long as it serves these efforts.\n\nIf two million are killed in Vietnam or Iraq or Afghanistan, the Deep State only counts its profits, the dead mean nothing.\n\nGovernments are fragile. Elections can be rigged, politicians purchased for a paltry sum and in a world where \everyone has a price,\"" anyone worth purchasing has been purchased.\n\nThus, every demonstration can be controlled or \""turned\"" in some way, every government can be destabilized and today, with the power of corrupt social media monoliths and Google Corporation, a massive psychological war begins not only on nations but individuals, all individuals, who are subject to the most dangerous addiction of all, electronic devices.\n\nAfter so many years, the most recent set up Middle East wars should be examined with skepticism and those involved assumed to be employees of Western intelligence agencies, faker than fake.\n\nWith the dramatic and somewhat manic and incoherent announcement by American President Donald Trump of the killing of \""chief head chopper\"" and \""super-villain,\"" Baghdadi, alleged head of ISIS or ISIL or Daesh, an analyst or intelligence specialist might well drown in skepticism or simply quit from frustration.\n\nThere are a thousand reasons the Baghdadi killing is fake, but top of the list is this one, there are no ISIS fighters, no facilities, no groups friendly to ISIS within hundreds of miles from where he was allegedly chased down by a dog.\n\nThose of us who know how the US works too well, those who had worked on similar projects, are fearful for different reasons. I once spent several weeks hunting Americans in South Vietnam, so very long ago, who had commanded a Viet Cong unit, the Q84 company.\n\nIt seems more than a few American joined the Viet Cong, not pilots mind you, but \""tip of the spear\"" special operations troops.\n\nThen again, half a century later and that story is forgotten. It may well be classified still, I can wait and find out, I guess.\n\nThen of course we will mention the bin Laden story in the most cursory manner. Reported dead on December 3, 2001 by even Fox News, after denying any complicity in the 9/11 terror attacks, he rose from the grave 6 inches shorter and with entirely different facial features for a long career of audio recordings carefully timed to distract audiences from endless American scandals, massive corruption, a badly botched hurricane recovery effort, a story too lengthy to get into now but fascinating all the same.\n\nThen back to Baghdadi and Trump's performance, which in itself was a humiliation for Americans, or at least literate and mentally stable Americans, a group that still exists despite efforts by American media to prove otherwise.\n\nThe entire idea is absurd according to Major General Igor Konashenkov of Russia's Defense Ministry, who initially reported the that the alleged raid was not seen by Russia's S400 radars, which everyone knows see everything, even the smallest drone a few feet off the ground.\n\nThat report was scrubbed by Google and Facebook but exists still on Tass.\n\n\""Russia's defense ministry has no reliable information about an operation by US forces in the Turkey-controlled part of the Idlib de-escalation zone aimed at another extermination of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,\"" he said.\n\nHe said that the fact that the number of those who say about their participation in al-Baghdadi's extermination and share contradictory details of the operation make one doubt that such an operation ever took place.\n\n\""We know nothing about any assistance to the flight of US aircraft to the Idlib de-escalation zone's airspace in the course of this operation,\"" Konashenkov said.\n\nAmericans and others in the West won't have this information, Google and Facebook delisted it and any publications that carried this language, but it exists just the same.\n\nYet another report about the extermination of al-Baghdadi can hardly influence the situation in Syria, Konashenkov said.\n\n\""After Islamic State was ultimately defeated by the Syrian government army with support of the Russia aerospace forces in early 2018, yet another 'death' of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi will have no impact either on the situation in Syria or on the actions of terrorists staying in Idlib,\"" he said.\n\nNo airstrikes by US forces reported from Syria's Idlib\n\nNo airstrikes by the US air force or by the US-led coalition have been reported from Syria's Idlib de-escalation zone in the recent days, Konashenkov noted.\n\n\""No airstrikes by either US air forces of the so-called international coalition have been registered in the Idlib de-escalation zone on Saturday and over the recent days,\"" Konashenkov said.\n\nApart from that the Russian defense ministry said it doubted that al-Baghdadi could be hiding on a territory controlled by Jabhat al-Nusra (outlawed in Russia as a terrorist organization) in Idlib.\n\n\""This organization has always unhesitatingly killed Islamic State fighters on the spot as key rivals for power in Syria. Bearing this in mind, the US or other participants in the operation should at least provide direct evidence that the former Islamic State leader had been safely staying on a territory controlled by the 'Syrian Al Qaeda (also outlawed in Russia),\"" he added.\n\nYou can't talk about ISIS without taking a cursory look at the White Helmets. According to the Russian government, this organization, an NGO which isn't an NGO as it gets its endless millions from NATO, fakes videos of alleged atrocities and has, itself, killed hundreds, even thousands.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming and has been presented time and time again, science, video analysis, witness statements and eventually 40 White Helmets themselves who told the world court that they were hired as actors to dupe the media.\n\nIt isn't just the White Helmets. You have the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights or several fake medical groups that report each attack on a terrorist operations center as the \""barrel bombing\"" of an orphanage or hospital.\n\nHowever, it is necessary that we return to background. After years of reports of ISIS operating with aid from the US and other nations delisted and censored, truth has become a rare commodity.\n\nWhile in Syria I reviewed statements made by captured ISIS employees in the custody of the Syrian Justice Ministry. Syria was holding these people for a period of time, debriefing them and resettling them with their families, thousands of them, many of whom now serve with the Syrian Arab Army.\n\nThough some were from Syria, others came from Malaysia, Indonesia, China and the Philippines, even Australia. They were given travel documents and passports that passed high level scrutiny and were flown to regions close enough to Syria to be trucked in by NGO's, often fake medical organization or refugee groups, that, in fact, were really run by Western intelligence agencies.\n\nAll the while, normal business travelers or tourists with their children would find themselves questioned and turned back if they attempted the same travel routes. This tells you who ISIS really is.\n\nThen I looked at the record of ISIS' real commanders, military officers from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, one even a Brigadier General from Israel, captured by Shiite Militias. I saw his identification papers and those of dozens of other ISIS leaders who still carried military identification from nations in the region. None were named \""Baghdadi.\""\n\nOne was an American Major General, a former head of psychological warfare and later commentator on Fox News who was rescued from Syrian commandos by the US Delta Force, an organization founded by one of Veterans Today's advisory board members.\n\nThat raid, on May 15, 2015, was fictionalized in this ABC News report from that period:\n\n\""In a ground raid deep in Syrian territory, U.S. special operations forces killed a top ISIS leader who they were attempting to capture and interrogate about American hostages and how the terror group finances its war machine, the Obama administration said today.\n\nOfficials told ABC News that the large-scale operation that killed ISIS oil and gas \""minister\"" ENTITY was carried out by the Army's elite counter-terror unit known as Delta Force under the direction of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC).\""\n\nThe American general, who Russian sources said had planned ISIS military actions against Iraq, was rescued as a force of Syrian commandos and Russian Spetznaz approached.\n\nThis was a real military success for the US, one where those involved deserved great credit even though it was done, as is too often the case, to advance the cause of international terrorism.\n\nYou see, whoever Baghdadi is or was, and there are two stories, one that he was released from prison by Americans, trained in Jordan, and put in command of ISIS, in a real sense he never existed.\n\nThe other story, one with more support, is that he is a British citizen of Jewish heritage named Shimon Elliott, trained in Israel to pass for an Arab, as thousands of Israeli intelligence operatives have over the years, and serve as \""fake commander\"" for an equally fake terror group, ISIS.\n\nWhoever Baghdadi is or was, and reports from Russian sources inside Syria say he is Iraq under American protection, it is reasonably sane to assume that his persona was fabricated to put a face on an intelligence operation that obviously advanced the cause of Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States against Russia, Iraq, Syria and Iran, a simple continuation of the wars begun after 9/11.\n\nTo understand why ISIS exists or who created al Qaeda in its many guises, this May 2, 2007 quote from General Wesley Clark, former Chairman of the JCOS and NATO commander under President Clinton will help. The interviewer is Amy Goodman from Democracy Now, General Clark speaking:\n\n\""But, you know, history doesn't repeat itself exactly twice. What I did warn about when I testified in front of Congress in 2002, I said if you want to worry about a state, it shouldn't be Iraq, it should be Iran. But this government, our administration, wanted to worry about Iraq, not Iran.\n\nI knew why, because I had been through the Pentagon right after 9/11. About ten days after 9/11, I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the Joint Staff who used to work for me, and one of the generals called me in. He said, 'Sir, you've got to come in and talk to me a second.' I said, 'Well, you're too busy.' He said, 'No, no.\"" He says, 'We've made the decision we're going to war with Iraq.\"" This was on or about the 20th of September. I said, 'We're going to war with Iraq? Why?' He said, 'I don't know.' He said, 'I guess they don't know what else to do.' So, I said, 'Well, did they find some information connecting Saddam to al-Qaeda?' He said, 'No, no.' He says, 'There's nothing new that way. They just made the decision to go to war with Iraq.' He said, 'I guess it's like we don't know what to do about terrorists, but we've got a good military and we can take down governments.' And he said, 'I guess if the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail.'\n\nSo, I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan. I said, 'Are we still going to war with Iraq?' And he said, 'Oh, it's worse than that.' He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper. And he said, 'I just got this down from upstairs' -- meaning the Secretary of Defense's office -- 'today.' And he said, 'This is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran.' I said, 'Is it classified?' He said, 'Yes, sir.' I said, 'Well, don't show it to me.' And I saw him a year or so ago, and I said, 'You remember that?' He said, 'Sir, I didn't show you that memo! I didn't show it to you!'\""\n\nWithout this statement from General Clark, to an extent a man who had outlived his time, it would be impossible to put a perspective on today's events.\n\nDid America create ISIS and al Qaeda? The probability of a \""yes\"" for that would be 100%. Can history be used as proof? If not, proof of every kind exists and control of the internet, buying the media, filling it with paid \""operatives\"" and silencing truthtellers has not been enough.\n\nWhy did Baghdadi have to die, a real or imaginary Baghdadi who died a real or imaginary death? The issue is always timing.\n\nLook at the most recent death of Osama bin Laden and note, Baghdadi has died several times before, once in an Israeli hospital in 2015 according to media reports.\n\nWith bin Laden, who sources say died in 2001, a daring operation in Pakistan, by operatives who mysteriously died in a helicopter crash soon after, the timing was even more curious.\n\nCIA Director Leon Panetta was retiring, and this operation was the last of his career. He was being replaced by General Petraeus and, according to sources, it was necessary to \""kill off\"" the endless number of fake bin Laden's so that Petraeus, a potential presidential candidate for the opposition party, would never be able to take credit.\n\nWe are reminded of SEAL Team 6, credited with the bin Laden raid, from the statement made by President Obama on their fate:\n\n\""Their deaths are a reminder of the extraordinary sacrifices made by the men and women of our military and their families, including all who have served in Afghanistan,'' President Obama said Saturday. 'We will draw inspiration from their lives and continue the work of securing our country and standing up for the values that they embodied.'\""\n\nOf recent events, Jeffrey Epstein killing himself in prison, Baghdadi being hunted down somewhere he could never be by people flying invisible planes coordinated with governments that say it never happened, we could go on forever.\n\nAll the while, the plan Wesley Clark read on that piece of paper so many years ago, plans made by absurd people serving an invisible master, has since become ingrained in history.\n\nGordon Duff is a Marine combat veteran of the Vietnam War that has worked on veterans and POW issues for decades and consulted with governments challenged by security issues. He's a senior editor and chairman of the board of Veterans Today, especially for the online magazine \""New Eastern Outlook.\""\n\nfrom https://journal-neo.org/2019/11/01/baghdadi-the-invisible-leader-of-a-fake-army/"
ABU SAYYAF GROUP,1,"MANILA - Despite the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and uncertainty surrounding the leadership of the terror group, the Mindanao region of southern Philippines is a new den of radical militants, where local militia give shelter to and train with foreign terrorists who have fled the extinct caliphate.\n\nENTITY, Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, Ansar Khalifa Philippines and the Maute group are the main groups affiliated with the IS in the Philippines.\n\nAlthough these groups don't have the capacity to establish a new caliphate, they have embraced forms of violence such as suicide attacks, a new phenomenon in the Southeast Asian country.\n\n\Mindanao is viewed to be a new land of jihad, a safe haven and an alternative home base by foreign terrorist fighters,\"" the chairman of the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research, Rommel Banlaoi, told EFE.\n\nThe analyst said that the southern Philippines is currently home to more than a hundred foreign terrorists from Malaysia, Indonesia and the Middle East, who are importing more violent methods to employ in their armed struggle.\n\nThe demise in March of the ruthless caliphate across Syria and Iraq declared in 2014 by Baghdadi prompted an exodus of terrorists to the Philippines, taking advantage of the weak controls at the airports and porous ports dotting the Mindanao coast, he added.\n\nAccording to Banlaoi, the manner of Baghdadi's death - he detonated his suicide vest in Syria on Sunday during a United States special forces raid - \""may intensify the nature of terrorist violence in Mindanao\"" due to the method \""which is an act of martyrdom for ISIS (another name for the IS) followers.\""\n\n\""Suicide terrorism is the current face of terror in the Philippines. Future trends can include children and youth in suicide terrorism,\"" he warned, in reference to the new tactics being employed by insurgent groups, which attract young people in poor and volatile Muslim Mindanao through a powerful propaganda machine on the internet.\n\nAlthough Islamist terrorism is not new in the Philippines, suicide attacks do not correspond to the classic modus operandi of local groups and pose a new threat in the country which, in the past year, has recorded four attacks of this kind, the first in its history and all claimed by the IS.\n\nThe first attack took place on July 31, 2018 on Basilan island - the traditional stronghold of ENTITY - where a dozen people were killed, followed by twin blasts in January in a cathedral in Jolo, the capital of Sulu, one of the most deadly attacks in the country's history with around 20 deaths and 100 injured.\n\nThe other two attacks, in June and September, targeted military camps in Sulu, a hard-to-reach archipelago that has become the new bastion of ENTITY, currently the strongest insurgent group with over 300 members in that area alone.\n\nIt is there that Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan, ENTITY's leader and new emir of the IS in Southeast Asia, has been hiding following the death of Isnilon Hapilon in the five-month Battle of Marawi that ended in October 2017.\n\nThe June attack was conducted by 20-year-old Norman Lasuca, an ENTITY militant and the first Filipino behind a suicide bombing, yet another symptom of the radicalization of local extremist groups.\n\nPhilippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana described Baghdadi's death as \""just a momentary setback, considering the depth and reach of the organization worldwide, particularly in the Philippines.\""\n\nHowever, the director of the International Observatory on Terrorism Studies, Carlos Igualada, pointed out that Philippine insurgent groups were greatly weakened after their defeat in the Battle of Marawi following their occupation of the heart of that Muslim city in the southern Philippines.\n\n\""I do not believe that Baghdadi's death will have much impact on the evolution of the jihadist movement in Southeast Asia because the groups in the region are focused on recovering the capacity that they had before Marawi, immersed in a process of reorganization, especially in positions of leadership,\"" he told EFE.\n\nIgualada also noted that Philippine extremist groups, despite many swearing allegiance to IS in 2014, have retained their independence and the influence of the caliphate was limited to the ideological level, with a leadership that was autonomous of Baghdadi.\n\nHowever, an estimated 800 Southeast Asian militants went to Syria to fight in the caliphate, many of whom have managed to escape the prison camps in which they were held.\n\n\""That poses a risk to Southeast Asia, which may be attacked by these returned fighters, which is the biggest concern for counter-terrorism,\"" Igualada added.\n\nFor Luke Lischin, an investigator of the United States' National War College, the links between the IS and Philippine extremism, especially ENTITY, is limited to ideology, but he also warns of the danger of the arrival in the country of fighters from Syria and Iraq \""in search of a new battleground.\"
ABU SAYYAF GROUP,1,"In 1971, Saul Alinsky published a book called Rules for Radicals in which the father of modern community organizing shared lessons he had learned over the years for successful protest. But the problem with Rules for Radicals is that protesters often conclude that protesting isn't enough. Historically, many social movements have escalated to violence after nonviolence failed.\n\nMichael Collins, for example, determined that \Irish Independence would never be attained by constitutional means\"" and that \""when you're up against a bully you've got to kick him in the guts.\"" In his memoire, Irgun leader Menachem Begin described the Zionist group's predicament after nonviolence failed to protect the Yishuv: \""What use was there in writing memoranda? What value in speeches? No, there was no other way. If we did not fight we should be destroyed.\"" When asked why they adopted violence in the 1950s, Algerian nationalists complained that the French had just shrugged off their futile strikes and boycotts. In her autobiography from the American Weather Underground, Susan Stern explained why her radical left-wing group escalated: \""As the years have passed, I've seen my efforts fail with thousands of others in the Civil Rights and anti-war movements. The time has come not merely to protest but to fight for what we believe in.\"" The leader of the Tamil Tigers shared a similar rationale for why his group embraced violence: \""The Tamil people have been expressing their grievances...for more than three decades. Their voices went unheard like cries in the wilderness.\"" The African National Congress released a similar statement in July 1963 about why it ramped up its anti-apartheid tactics: \""It can now truly be said that very little, if any, scope exists for the smashing of white supremacy other than by means of mass revolution action, the main content of which is armed resistance leading to victory by military means.\"" The truth is that some radicals will become rebels, and there are rules for them, too.\n\nMy book, Rules for Rebels, starts off where Rules for Radicals ends. It analyzes hundreds of militant groups from all over the world to discern why some succeed and others fail. I come with welcome news for the rebel leader. My research reveals that he possesses a surprising amount of agency over his political destiny. Triumph is possible. But only when he knows what to do. It turns out there's a science to victory in militant history. But even rebels must follow rules.\n\nSmart militant leaders do three simple things to increase the odds of victory.\n\nThe first rule is for the leader to recognize that not all violence is equal for achieving his stated political goals. In fact, smart leaders grasp that some attacks should be carefully avoided because they're deeply counterproductive for the cause. My research is the first to empirically demonstrate that there's variation in the political utility of attacks depending on the target. Compared with more selective violence against military and other government targets, indiscriminate violence against civilian targets lowers the likelihood of political success. So the first thing smart militants do is recognize that civilian attacks are a recipe for political failure. You might say that the first rule for rebels is to not use terrorism at all. There's no consensus over the definition of terrorism. But most scholars define it as attacks against civilian targets in particular. When we talk about terrorism, we mean attacks on civilian targets like schools, markets, movie theaters, rock concerts, soccer games, commercial airplanes, cruise ships, mosques, businesses and apartment buildings unless occupied by military personnel. We're certainly not talking about blowing the treads off a tank. What matters for the militant leader, though, isn't how we define terrorism, but that he learns the folly of harming civilians.\n\nThe second rule is to actively restrain lower-level members from harming civilians. It doesn't matter whether the leader understands the futility of terrorism if his members continue to do it. The key is for the leader to centralize the organization, so he can educate fighters to avoid civilians, discipline those who harm civilians and vet out prospective members who seem prone to undermining the cause with terrorism.\n\nAnd the third rule is for the leader to distance the organization from terrorism whenever wayward subordinates flout his targeting guidelines by attacking civilians. Like CEOs, smart militant leaders know how to brand their organization for maximum appeal when members publicly shame it. In practice, this means denying organizational responsibility when members kill civilians. Or when caught red-handed, apologizing for the terrorist attack and blaming it on rogue fighters to highlight that their grisly methods run counter to the ideals of the group.\n\nWhen you look scientifically at the history of militant groups, one thing becomes immediately clear about the Islamic State (ISIS): Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was one stupid leader. Baghdadi could have written a book called Rules for Rebels to Fail. Indeed, he did the exact opposite of what smart leaders have historically done to achieve their stated political goals.\n\nBaghdadi clearly didn't understand the most important rule of sparing civilians to reduce the audience costs. Like Antar Zouabri of the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi of the Al-Qaeda affiliate in Iraq and other imbecilic militant leaders throughout world history, Baghdadi failed to appreciate that blowing up innocent people only jeopardizes the cause by turning the population against you and reducing the likelihood of political concessions. This is true, I find, even in hostage settings, where killing even one civilian substantially lowers the odds of governments making any concessions at all to the perpetrators.\n\nTo maximize the civilian carnage, Baghdadi also flouted the second rule by decentralizing ISIS' recruitment and operations. By 2016, he had accepted the \""bayat,\"" or allegiance, of 43 terrorist group affiliates, from Boko Haram in Nigeria to ENTITY in the Philippines. Now, they were all fighting under the black banner. Where affiliates didn't exist to maximize the bloodletting, he appealed to lone wolf terrorists to kill essentially anyone on their wish list.\n\nAnd Baghdadi broke the third cardinal rule by publicly broadcasting in lurid detail ISIS' heinous crimes against civilians over social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Rather than denying organizational responsibility for the carnage, he encouraged members to brag about it, leaving no doubt that his group was the baddest one on the block.\n\nThis was a terrific strategy for attracting sociopaths to the group, but quickly turned other militant organizations against it, dried up local support and elicited the largest counterterrorism coalition ever assembled, costing his life along with the caliphate. The media fixated on every known foreign fighter to join ISIS, while ignoring the bigger picture that its attrition rate had steadily outstripped its recruitment rate.\n\nBecause most militant leaders restrain the rank-and-file, taking them out with drones or other means typically increases the amount of organizational violence against civilians by empowering less strategic lower-level members. But Baghdadi's death won't increase the amount of terrorism because he was too dense to recognize its limitations. Baghdadi was like a CEO so incompetent that losing him will have no discernible effect on the firm's performance.\n\nMax Abrahms is a professor of political science at Northeastern University and the author of Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History."

ABU SAYYAF GROUP,1,"People look at a destroyed house near the village of Barisha in Syria's Idlib province, after a U.S. military operation that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Oct. 27, 2019. AP\n\nSoutheast Asian nations have beefed up security to thwart possible \revenge attacks\"" after the killing of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, officials said Monday, even as counter-terrorism agencies in the region felt his death would not dampen the resilience of local militants.\n\nAl-Baghdadi, who became the world's most-wanted terrorist after he declared a so-called caliphate in Mosul, Iraq, in 2014, killed himself and three of his children when he detonated a suicide vest during a raid by U.S. forces in northwest Syria's Idlib region, President Donald Trump announced Sunday.\n\nIn Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, officials warned of the possibility of attacks by local militants sympathetic to Baghdadi in a bid to avenge the death of the IS leader, who had led the jihadist group since 2010.\n\n\""All [militant] networks have been monitored by Densus 88,\"" Indonesian national police spokesman Asep Adi Saputra told BenarNews, referring to the country's elite counter-terrorism strike force. \""But, still, the recent event has prompted us to be more alert to anticipate possible revenge attacks by al-Baghdadi supporters.\""\n\nThe first terrorist attack claimed by IS in Southeast Asia was in Indonesia, more than three years ago.\n\nIn January 2016, authorities blamed a local IS-linked group known as Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) for a gun and bomb attack that killed eight people, including the four attackers, in Jakarta's central business district.\n\nJAD was also blamed for coordinated attacks in the Indonesian city of Surabaya in May 2018, when two families carried out suicide bombings on three churches and a police station. Twenty-four people were killed, including the attackers who used their children as young as 9 in the bombings.\n\nRidlwan Habib, a security analyst at the University Indonesia, said al-Baghdadi's killing could prompt IS's local supporters to launch revenge attacks, as he urged Jakarta to remain on alert, \""because even though he is dead, the ideology is still alive.\""\n\n\""It is possible that some followers are determined to avenge his death,\"" he told BenarNews. \""Some may even be inspired by al-Baghdadi and blow themselves up with a bomb vest.\""\n\nGovernments in Southeast Asia, home to more than 270 million Muslims, have been concerned over IS expanding its network in the region ever since the militant group lost control of its self-proclaimed caliphate - wide swaths of land covering an area as big as Great Britain - in parts of Syria and Iraq in March.\n\nIn the Philippines, where IS-linked local militants launched a major siege that devastated the southern city of Marawi two years ago, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said he believed that al-Baghdadi's death was \""just a momentary setback\"" for IS, considering the militant group's reach worldwide.\n\n\""Somebody will take his place to lead the IS. Maybe not as famous and well known,\"" Lorenzana told reporters.\n\nMilitary officials placed troops in the restive southern Philippines on heightened alert Monday for possible \""sympathy attacks.\""\n\nThe precautionary move was taken just before the Catholic country was to shut down for annual All Souls' and All Saints Day holiday this coming weekend, when millions of Filipinos were expected to visit cemeteries and pay respects to the dead.\n\nAmong IS-linked groups in southern Philippines is the ENTITY, which President Rodrigo Duterte has vowed to crush after it was linked to deadly attacks on civilian and military targets, as well as numerous abductions, including foreigners.\n\nA key ENTITY faction is led by Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan, who has been identified as the new leader of the IS affiliate operating in the southern Philippines.

Dozens have been freed but no clear number is available.\n\nMalaysia's first IS-linked terror attack took place on June 26, 2016, when a grenade blast injured eight patrons at the Movida nightclub in Puchong town near Kuala Lumpur.

Just this morning, the first order I gave was a directive among units within Western Mindanao Command to intensify their intelligence operations, monitor hostile plans of the ISIS-inspired groups,\"" Sobejana told reporters in an interview.\n\nBloody trail\n\nBaghdadi left behind a horrific trail of beheadings, mass executions, rapes, abductions and ethnic cleansing in his five years as the self-proclaimed \""caliph\"" of Iraq and Syria.\n\nWorld leaders welcomed the news of his death on Monday.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said \""the killing of Daesh's ringleader marks a turning point in our joint fight against terrorism.\"" He added that Turkey would \""continue to support anti-terror efforts -- as it has done in the past.\""\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said \""the death of al-Baghdadi is a hard blow against Daesh (IS) but it is just a stage.\""\n\n\""The fight will continue with our partners in the international coalition to ensure that the terror organization is definitively defeated.

ABU SAYYAF GROUP,1,"The Syrian Civil War represents one of the most complex battlespaces in the history of modern warfare. Since the war began in 2013, the Syrian landscape has been pocked with regular Syrian forces, Russian military advisors, American special operations forces, rebel groups opposed to Bashar al-Assad, non-state groups in support of al-Assad, Islamist militias, Syrian Kurdish militias, terrorist organizations, and opportunist criminal enterprises. At one point, media reported an estimated 1,000 armed opposition groups, and most have divergent agendas.\n\nNotwithstanding the killing this weekend of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a U.S. military operation, those complexities are compounded by the increasing urgency of finding solutions to ensure accountability for individuals who might be responsible for war crimes and other atrocities and who have been detained by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. The recent focus on the untenable humanitarian and operational situation at the al-Hawl (Al Hol) refugee facility, along with the Turkish invasion into northern Syria, has brought those questions to the fore.\n\nAs with other armed conflicts, finding competent jurisdictions with the requisite resources to resolve atrocity crimes, particularly those committed by ISIS in Syria, is difficult. An examination of available jurisdictions and the feasibility of using each of them reveals what is clearly the best option to ensure accountability.\n\nJurisdiction represents the official power to make legal decisions and judgments, usually from a system of law courts. Building criminal cases against war criminals during or shortly after armed conflict is difficult to begin with, as criminal intelligence and law enforcement activities historically take a back seat to operational intelligence and military operations. Northeastern Syria represents even greater challenges due to the number of nationalities represented in the population of detained foreign fighters, lack of an effective international criminal accountability mechanism, disparate enforcement of extraterritorial jurisdiction laws of third countries, lack of effective documentation methods, a just-barely functioning court system in the self-administered region of Rojava in northeastern Syria that is running at maximum capacity, and a Syrian court system that knows no due process. All of that is exacerbated by the reticence of third countries such as the United Kingdom and France to repatriate their citizens so that they can be held accountable with better judicial resources and stronger guarantees of due process.\n\nOften, initial information during armed conflict about potential violations of international atrocities law -- covering war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity -- comes from observations and documentation from media and human rights organizations. Such information is rarely evidence quality and is stored away with the hope that one day, far into the future, some competent tribunal will take on a criminal case.\n\nThis practice fails to recognize that there are sometimes criminal jurisdictions immediately available to prosecute these crimes, or related crimes, under the domestic laws of those states where the violations occurred, or those states whose citizens have participated in the commission of crimes.\n\nCriminal jurisdiction requires official legal authority over a person due to his or her nationality, or jurisdiction over an offense committed within the sovereign territory by a person of any nationality. There is also universal jurisdiction, allowing states to prosecute certain international crimes regardless of where they have been committed or by whom. However, some states have chosen not to exercise universal jurisdiction. For example, the United Kingdom has chosen not to repatriate British nationals Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, two of the so-called \Beatles\"", and instead chose to strip them of their citizenship.\n\nIn northeastern Syria, there are multiple potential criminal jurisdictions available right now that could remove detained belligerents from seemingly indefinite pre-trial or security detention in sub-standard facilities, and subject them instead to due process where governments can achieve final accountability. However, prosecution in some of these jurisdictions is more feasible than others.\n\nSyrian \""Justice\""\n\nThe government of Syria has primary jurisdiction over offenses committed by ISIS for two reasons. First, the criminal activity committed by members of ISIS occurred on Syrian soil in violation of Syrian domestic law. Syria is a civil law system that has functioning criminal courts and well-educated lawyers. On paper, Syrian criminal law appears very similar to other civil law systems.\n\nThat said, despite having a written criminal code, Syrian criminal justice is not known for its guarantees of due process, but rather its pre-trial torture and post-trial mass executions after trials lasting several minutes. The disparity comes from non-legal forces that have authority greater than the law itself, namely a corrupt dictator with absolute power who is above his own laws.\n\nDespite being an available jurisdiction, justice in the Syrian system, without due process and the protection of the rights of an accused, is not the type of accountability that would be palatable to the international community.\n\nThe Rojava Option\n\nWhen stability in Syria first dissolved in 2012, the inhabitants of northeastern Syria attempted a level of democratic self-governance without the acquiescence of the Syrian government. The Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (NES), or Rojava as it is known in Syria, has been the de facto government in that region since 2012. Rojava has a constitution and a legal system that notably features a ban on the death penalty, female judges, a ban on extradition to death penalty countries like Iraq, and creative restorative justice. The courts have already tried thousands of Syrian ISIS suspects.\n\nOn the surface, this progressive-leaning system should be ripe for international support. Although it is successfully convicting thousands of ISIS members, it remains rudimentary in a number of respects. For example, it lacks forensic, fingerprinting, and DNA capability. This means defendants are convicted for violations of terrorism laws that are easy to prove (laws against the state) instead of more substantive crimes like rape, murder, and slavery (laws against people) that require more evidence than just membership in a terrorist organization. Further, trial and conviction for international crimes that capture the full extent of ISIS brutality, like war crimes and genocide, are impractical within that system.\n\nUnfortunately, several practical hurdles also stand in the way of international support of the nascent Rojavian justice system. Rojavian jurists are accused by the government of Syria of setting up and creating an illegal judiciary. Judges and staff face arrest warrants from Syria, lack passports, and are frequently subjected to death threats. Additionally, international engagement with the Rojavian courts is difficult since Rojava is not recognized as independent by any state and can only conduct limited foreign relations as a result. This makes governmental programming very difficult, if not impossible.\n\nRojavian authorities have asked the international community to set up an international war crimes tribunal based in Rojava, but there are significant obstacles to such a concept. First, the recent invasion of Syria by Turkish forces threatens to de-stabilize the region even further, raising the question to what extent the Rojavian government will be able to maintain any effective control over the area. Second, the creation of an international court in Rojava, against the wishes of the government of Syria, would violate Syrian sovereignty and would likely require the approval of the United Nations Security Council. Russia, China, and very likely even the United States would not approve such a measure. Finally, many states maintain a concern about the connection between Rojavian authorities and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in Turkey that the United States and others consider to be a terrorist organization.\n\nInternational Tribunals\n\nThe International Criminal Court, often lauded by human rights activists and victims of atrocities as the tribunal of choice, lacks jurisdiction to try ISIS members in Syria for the simple fact that Syria is not a party to the Rome Statute (nor were its crimes at issue here committed within a jurisdiction that is a party). This has not precluded other initiatives for international tribunals. Sweden has long supported the idea of an international tribunal to try ISIS members to fill the capability and jurisdiction challenges in Syria and Iraq.\n\nAn international tribunal has several advantages. First, such a tribunal can usually try criminal defendants for crimes under customary international law, like war crimes, capturing the full extent of a defendant's criminality. Second, international tribunals ordinarily recruit some of the world's best jurists. Third, international tribunals are neutral compared with those of an interested nation-state.\n\nOf course, there are practical issues hindering the effectiveness of all international tribunals. The first, and most chronic problem, is that their creation tends to move at a glacial pace, often resulting in stale accounts of facts and evidence tainted by time and battlefield mishandling. Second, the primary witnesses to atrocity crimes are often displaced persons who have no known address and are difficult to find when their testimony is needed at later dates. Third, because of a lack of capacity, international tribunals usually only focus on the most senior defendants, leaving more junior actors to be subjected to some other form of justice, or escape it entirely. Although senior members of terrorist organizations may be most responsible, often some of the more junior members carried out the most monstrous criminal acts.\n\nIraq's Terrorism Courts\n\nThe terrorism courts of Iraq are certainly available to try ISIS members for crimes against Iraq. In the past, the Iraqi courts have focused on defendants captured in Iraq, or Iraqi citizens captured in Syria, like the case of ISIS member Umm Sayyaf. Sayyaf was the wife of senior ISIS member ENTITY. She was captured by American special operations forces in 2015. As an Iraqi citizen, she was handed over to Iraq by the United States. Interestingly, she was tried in Erbil, the capitol of the semi-autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan Region, which has a de facto moratorium on the death penalty. Sayyaf was convicted of being a member of ISIS and sentenced to death by the Iraqi Kurdish terrorism court, although there is little chance of the sentence actually being carried out at this time.\n\nSayyaf has also been indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice under American laws. The United States has an extraterritorial jurisdiction statute that allows the prosecution of non-U.S. citizens for acts of terrorism that result in the death of an American citizen, in this case American aid worker Kayla Mueller.\n\nIraq has tried non-Iraqi members of ISIS captured in Syria, like the French ISIS member Mustapha Merzoughi, under Iraqi laws since ISIS is a transnational threat to the security of Iraq. Merzoughi is being tried in Iraqi courts because France refused to take him back. Whether Iraq will continue this practice or it is an aberration remains to be seen, considering the Iraqi Foreign Minister's statement this month that it is Iraqi policy to bring only Iraqi members of ISIS back to the country for trial.\n\nCompetent jurisdiction aside, the Iraqi criminal justice system is not well-respected by the international community: the trials are notoriously short, with little opportunity to confront accusers and cross-examine witnesses, and sentences are severe, often resulting in the death penalty. The exception is the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, which has a de facto moratorium on the death penalty.\n\nRepatriation Remains the Best Option - and a Long Shot\n\nAt least for third-country-national members of ISIS, the greatest chance of criminal accountability is for those states to repatriate their citizens and subject them to the judicial process at home. Most states have extraterritorial jurisdiction laws that allow them to have jurisdiction over serious crimes committed by their citizens worldwide. The United States has urged, with varying success, that other countries, especially in Europe, take their thousands of detained citizens back.\n\nMany European states have refused to take their fighters back, citing an inability to prove cases against suspects and a lack of resources to place returning jihadists under constant surveillance. The United States has warned that a failure to repatriate these individuals could result in them simply going free.\n\nRegardless of which countries try which members of ISIS, the international community needs to begin taking more decisive action if it is serious about bringing members of ISIS to justice. Without effective prosecutions, there is a danger of ISIS members going free.\n\nOr worse, ISIS members with no prospect of criminal trial may be subjected to a more \""political\"" disposition in Syria: extrajudicial killing. Using a tactic against ISIS that the group has used so brutally against its victims risks compounding the injustices of these conflicts and extending the cycles of violence."
ABU SAYYAF GROUP,1,"The death of ISIS' top leader in the Middle East may shift extremists' attention closer to home as they try to avenge his death and assert their influence, says leading terrorism analyst Rohan Gunaratna\n\nTERRORIST KILLED. An image grab taken from a propaganda video released on July 5, 2014 by al-Furqan Media allegedly shows the leader of the Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, addressing worshippers at a mosque in the ISIS-held northern Iraqi city of Mosul. Al-Furqan Media/Handout/AFP\n\nMANILA, Philippines - Filipino terror groups linked to Islamic State (ISIS) will \very likely\"" attempt violent attacks to avenge the reported killing on Sunday of ISIS top leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a leading terrorism analyst told journalists on Monday, October 28.\n\n\""As you know, in the Philippines itself, more than 3 dozen groups pledged allegiance to Islamic State. In Southeast Asia alone, there are more than 100 networks that pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. So it is very likely that at least some of these groups will mount revengeful attacks, or what they call retribution attacks,\"" said Rohan Gunaratna, professor of Security Studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technology University in Singapore.\n\nAlthough al-Baghdadi was a central figure in the ISIS lore that drew a following of tens of thousands of extremists from different parts of the world, the group's relative decline in the Middle East and the emergence of its \""provinces\"" elsewhere such as in the Philippines means its ideology, influence, and malevolence lives on.\n\n\""I think it was important that he was killed. He was a very ruthless and a very cruel leader. And he created a very effective legend, that he was the caliph, the leader of the Islamic State,\"" Gunaratna said.\n\n\""It has been shattered. But he has invested a lot of time and energy and organization to mobilize tens of thousands of people around the world. And now the world has to deal with those people,\"" he added.\n\nThe loss of al-Baghdadi, Gunaratna said, will further decentralize ISIS and push its regional tentacles to organize on their own.\n\nISIS in the Philippines\n\nSeveral extremist groups based in Mindanao have pledged allegiance to ISIS since it came to prominence for its ruthlessness and destructiveness in the Middle East in 2014.\n\nThe Maute group, named after the family that formed it, laid siege to Marawi City in May 2017. The 5-month battle with government forces killed more than 1,000 people, and marked the undeniable entry of ISIS ideology - the attempt to carve out an Islamic territory based on a brutal interpretation of the religion - into the Philippines.\n\nThe Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters faction led by Esmael Abdulmalik a.k.a. Abu Torayfie - the Dawlah Islamiyah Torayfie Group - has been blamed for several bombings and attacks in central Mindanao.\n\nThe ENTITY (ASG) faction in Basilan province led by Furuji Indama carried out what was believed to be the first suicide bombing in the Philippines, according to the military. On July 31, 2018, a \""foreign looking\"" suspect drove a van by a paramilitary checkpoint in the outskirts of Lamitan City, where it exploded, killing 10 people.\n\nAnother faction of the ASG based in Sulu province led by Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan was responsible for a series of suicide bombings in the province earlier this year. Attacks on a Catholic cathedral in Jolo town in January, a Philippine Army camp in Indanan town in June, and a military checkpoint also in Indanan in September, have killed a total of 32 people, including the bombers.\n\nOne of the suicide bombers in the June 28 attack in Indanan was Filipino, an unprecedented case according to the police and military.\n\nSawadjaan is known to be the leader of ISIS in the Philippines. Security officials earlier said he was harboring at least 7 foreign extremists in his hideout in Sulu to train suicide bombers, if not to do it themselves.\n\nAttacks unlikely?\n\nPhilippine security officials on Monday welcomed the report of al-Baghdadi's death. US President Donald Trump on Sunday said the ISIS leader detonated a suicide vest when he was cornered in a raid by US Special Forces in northwestern Syria.\n\nThe Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) said it was a \""severe blow\"" to terror groups around the world. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said as much, but added that al-Baghdadi's death was \""just a momentary setback\"" for ISIS.\n\nThe military downplayed the threat from local terrorists, saying it \""seriously doubts\"" there would be retaliatory attacks, according to AFP spokesperson Brigadier General Edgard Arevalo.\n\nNevertheless, government forces on the ground were \""ready for any eventuality,\"" Arevalo added.\n\nAlthough the leaders of local ISIS-linked groups will likely feel the impact of al-Baghdadi's loss, their \""rank and file\"" fighters probably know too little about him to get the urge to avenge his killing, said AFP Western Mindanao Command chief Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana.\n\nSobejana said he ordered troops under his command \""to intensify their intelligence operations, monitor the hostile plans of the ISIS-inspired groups here in the area, and take proactive measures so we do not just take it for granted...but there is no cause for alarm.\""\n\nISIS and Al Qaeda\n\nAlthough some local extremist groups are linked to ISIS in the Middle East by ideology, Gunaratna said they are mostly able to finance and organize their own operations, and are unlikely to feel the pinch should the mothership tank.\n\nMoreover, al-Baghdadi's rivalry with Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was pretty much the only thing that prevented ISIS and Al Qaeda from joining forces.\n\n\""When these leaders die, the younger leaders have no problem with cooperation and collaboration,\"" Gunaratna said, and wiith al-Baghdadi gone, the two terror organizations will likely \""come together.\""\n\nThat means local ISIS-linked groups may soon join forces with Al Qaeda-linked ones. For example, Sawadjaan's faction of the ASG might absorb the broader group led by the aging Radullan Sahiron, who rejected ISIS.\n\nISIS-inspired groups in Southeast Asia could pair up with the Indonesia-based Jemaah Islamiyah, which is linked to Al Qaeda.\n\nWith ISIS losing territory in Iraq and Syria, its leadership dispersing, and now, its apex leader killed, extremists in other parts of the world have less reason to fixate on the Middle East, and will likely shift their attention closer to home.\n\nTerrorism is \""morphing\"" and terrorists are \""changing their format,\"" Gunaratna warned.\n\n\""They are now returning to their own home countries, and they will build a new generation of fighters.... Governments will have to be prepared for that,\"" he added. - Rappler.com"

I don't think they are as closed about what happened,' Marsha Mueller told the Arizona Republic.\n\nTrump announced Sunday morning that Baghdadi 'died like a dog' as the result of a raid on his hideout in northwest Syria.\n\nThe president touted the operation and al-Baghdadi's death as 'bigger than bin Laden'. Osama bin Laden, founder of Al-Qaeda and the terrorist leader behind the September 11 terrorist attacks, was killed in 2011 during a Navy SEALs operation during Barack Obama's presidency.\n\n'This is the biggest there is. This is the worst ever. Osama bin Laden was big, but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center. This is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, a country,' Trump said, referencing Baghdadi's creation of the Islamic State.\n\nTrump also referred to Baghdadi and those who followed him as 'losers,' and lauded that no U.S. personnel were lost during the raid. He did say, however, that one 'talented canine' was injured.\n\n'I got to watch much of it. No personnel were lost in the operation, while a large number of Baghdadi's fighters and companions were killed with him,' Trump said during his rare Sunday morning remarks.\n\n'He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way,' Trump continued, adding that Baghdadi drug three of his children with him.\n\n'They were led to certain death.\n\nCarl and Marsha Mueller, the parents of Kayla Mueller, who was raped and tortured by slain ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, say she could still be alive if Obama had been as decisive as Trump\n\nAl-Baghdadi, the leader of the so-called Islamic caliphate, blew himself up during the targeted attack on his lair in Syria's Idlib province in the early hours of Sunday morning. His lair was in a village known for smuggling, and he arrived there 48 hours before the raid\n\nTrump said, without explanation on Saturday that 'Something very big has just happened!' and the White House confirmed the president would be addressing the nation on Sunday morning\n\n'He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast. the tunnel had caved in on it, in addition. But test results gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification. It was him. The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him,' he said.\n\nInformation is now emerging over how the U.S. was able to track down Baghdadi, including details of his whereabouts from two inside informants.\n\nA senior Iraqi intelligence official told the Associated Press that a few months ago an Iraqi aide to al-Baghdadi was killed in western Iraq by a U.S. airstrike, and his wife was arrested and handed over to Iraqi authorities.\n\nThe official indicated that the wife ended up being a key source of information on Baghdadi's whereabouts. The Iraqis who had her in custody were ultimately able to pass along to the U.S. coordinates on Baghdadi through information they learned from the aide's wife.\n\nA second Iraqi security official said Baghdadi's brother-in-law was recently arrested by the Iraqis and also gave information on Baghdadi's whereabouts\n\nThe ISIS leader's two wives, who were both wearing explosive devices that never detonated, were taken down. Several of his children were taken from the lair and are still alive. Several others were killed in the attack.\n\nTrump said more people were killed than captured, but confirmed there are some in U.S. custody.\n\nKurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) confirmed on Sunday they had worked with the U.S. on a 'successful' operation against Islamic State.\n\n'Our strong and effective operations once again confirm our strength and determination to go after (Islamic State),' the head of the SDF's media office said.\n\nSyrians ride a motorcycle past a burnt vehicle near the site where a helicopter gunfire reportedly killed nine people near the northwestern Syrian village of Barisha\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces is an alliance in the Syrian Civil War made up of primarily Kurdish, Arab and Assyrian/Syriac militias.\n\nSDF General Commander Mazloum Abdi took partial credit for taking down Baghdadi, but also thanked the president and U.S. Army in its efforts, which he said have been under way for almost half-a-year.\n\n'For five months there has been joint intel cooperation on the ground and accurate monitoring, until we achieved a joint operation to kill Abu Bakir al-Baghdadi. Thanks to everybody who participate in this great mission,' Abdi tweeted, tagging Donald Trump's Twitter account.\n\nThe president also thanked those who had assisted in finding Baghdadi, participated in the raid and brought him to his death. He said that while the Kurds provided information that was useful in taking down Baghdadi, they did not assist in the military operations.\n\nThe ISIS leader has been among U.S. and Europe's force's most wanted figures since his chilling call to arms in 2014, which saw a shift away from the mass casualty attacks carried out by al-Qaeda in favor of smaller-scale acts of violence.\n\nShifting away from the airline hijackings and other mass-casualty attacks that came to define al-Qaeda, Baghdadi encouraged smaller-scale acts of violence that would be harder for law enforcement to prepare for and prevent.\n\nHe encouraged jihadists who could not travel to the caliphate to instead kill where they were using whatever weapon they had at their disposal, resulting in a series of devastating attacks in the UK and Europe.\n\nHis words inspired more than 140 terrorist attacks in 29 countries other than Iraq and Syria, resulting in the deaths of at least 2,043 people, CNN reports.\n\nMeeting in the situation room Saturday night (from left to right): National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, Vice President Mike Pence, Trump, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley and Brig.

If you see me on the right path, help me. If you see me on the wrong path, advise me and halt me. And obey me as far as I obey God.'\n\nThe death of such a high-value U.S. target comes amid a difficult political backdrop for Trump, who has been frustrated heavy media focus on the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, which he calls a bipartisan smear.\n\nHe has also faced withering criticism from both Republicans and Democrats alike for his U.S. troop withdrawal from northeastern Syria, which permitted Turkey to attack America's Kurdish allies."
BAYT AL MAQDIS,1,"Reports of a secret war being waged by Hamas against Salafi-jihadist groups in the Gaza Strip are indicative of increasing challenges to the former's security control within the enclave. Recent attacks launched by Salafist cells toward Israel and on Hamas members, including those with purported links to ISIS, impede the fragile ceasefire that exists between Hamas and Israel. Hamas' current approach to violent Salafist cells in Gaza is equally demonstrative of an ongoing warming of relations between Cairo and Hamas, and one that has afforded Hamas international legitimacy and an ease in border restrictions. Aided by Israeli intelligence and military operations, Egypt has been engaged in the largest military campaign in the Sinai since the 1973 war with Israel in an effort to curb ISIS-affiliated militants. The expanded crackdown in the Gaza Strip is thus also meant to provide further confirmation of Hamas' new-found allegiance to Cairo and its definitive break from past collaboration with Sinai-based militant groups.\n\nA delicate status quo\n\nHamas' adoption of a more aggressive attitude toward armed Salafists in the Gaza Strip comes in the wake of attacks on the group's political and military leadership. This summer, suicide bombers believed to be linked to ISIS killed three Hamas police officers in Gaza City. According to Gazan officials, the recent arrest of four Salafist cells disrupted further planned attacks on Hamas security forces and representatives. Salafist factions have also allegedly been responsible for ramping up tensions with Israel, by launching long-range rockets into Israeli territory in defiance of fragile ceasefire agreements between Hamas and Israel. In March 2019, both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) denied responsibility for rockets fired at Tel Aviv -- in spite of reports suggesting that the military capability for such attacks lies exclusively with these two groups. Hamas has, at times, contracted PIJ to hit Israeli target to avoid direct involvement. Nevertheless, Hamas' reported confiscation of long-range rockets held by Salafi cells points to the existence of a sophisticated arsenal of weapons that can reach far into Israeli territory.\n\nThis is not the first time that Hamas has sought to curb violent Salafi-jihadi activities in Gaza. Over the past decade, Hamas has, as Benedatta Berti notes, become more determined in regulating and controlling these groups, mostly as a reaction to the Salafi-jihadis' repeated defiance of the Hamas government. Salafi-jihadi groups, such as Jaysh al-Islam, have emerged in the Palestinian Territories -- and predominately Gaza -- since the mid-2000s, where they have been able to gain strength due to the ongoing power struggle between Fatah and Hamas and capitalize on disgruntlement with Hamas' perceived accommodation with Israel and its gradual approach to Islamization. This latter criticism equally derives from the radical ideology which underlies Salafi-jihadism in Gaza. Similarly to criticism levelled at the wider Muslim Brotherhood movement out of which Hamas emerged, Salafi-jihadi groups denounce pragmatic governance, including electoral participation, and seek a transnational religious dimension to Palestinian resistance that is closer to the rhetoric used by al-Qaeda than armed Palestinian opposition groups such as Hamas.\n\nHamas-Salafi cooperation\n\nDespite diverging ideologies and practices, Hamas has in the past cooperated with Salafi-jihadi groups, including those based in the Sinai Peninsula, in an effort to buoy its Islamist credentials and achieve common objectives. In the aftermath of Mohammed Morsi's ousting and Egypt's subsequent campaign to destroy Hamas' underground tunnel infrastructure, Israeli reports revealed the existence of a transactional relationship between Hamas and ISIS' Sinai branch, Wilayat Sinai (WS). In return for cross-border weapons smuggling through the so-called \Libya Highway\"" and the Sudan route, Hamas is said to have provided critical logistics and military training to WS and its predecessor, Ansar ENTITY, in addition to advanced weapons and medical assistance.\n\nJihadi groups in the Sinai also benefitted from the influx of Gazan fighters, including members of the Jund Ansar Allah movement, which has aided WS in launching a deadly insurgency against the Egyptian regime. The reported reconciliation in 2013 with Salafi groups in the Gaza Strip through the mediation of Kuwaiti and Qatari clerics, too, was attributed to the removal of Muslim Brotherhood leader Morsi and reflected what one Hamas source referred to as a relationship \""based on common local interest that trumps ideology.\"" Still, the then established joint committee evidently failed to solve internal problems and ensure Salafists' adherence to cease-fire agreements with Israel while ensuring Hamas' military superiority.\n\nAn Egyptian-Hamas d�tente\n\nA warming of ties between Hamas and the Egyptian regime has also proven an obstacle to Salafi-Hamas cooperation. The execution of an alleged Hamas collaborator by ISIS' Sinai branch in 2018, according to the video's narrator, was partly conducted in response to Hamas' crackdown on Islamist militant groups in Gaza and its \""following in the footsteps of the disbelieving West.\"" The coordinated attack by Gazan Salafi-jihadists in an ISIS operation that targeted an Egyptian security checkpoint in July 2017 was similarly attributed to militants' discontent with the growing Egyptian-Hamas rapprochement -- and one that has involved Hamas disclaiming its links to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nThe relationship between Hamas and Egypt has improved markedly since 2017. Beyond functioning as a mediatory between Hamas and Fatah and Hamas and Israel, Egypt is believed to have offered concessions on trade and free movement across the Rafah crossing in return for moves to secure the border -- through the establishment of a buffer zone -- against ISIS fighters. Since May 2018, Egypt has opened the border crossing with Gaza and Hamas delegations visiting Cairo, including those involving Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, have become a common occurrence.\n\nIn a further sign of d�tente, Hamas recently ordered its supporters to refrain from commenting on ongoing demonstrations against Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi's rule, contrary to its position in 2011, when it welcomed the removal of President Hosni Mubarak and clamped down on pro-Egyptian rallies in Gaza. According to Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassam, this change in position is a consequence of \""the relationship with Egypt [being] at its best and there [being] continuous communication between the Hamas leadership and the leaders in Egypt, and an understanding on bilateral issues such as securing borders and fighting extremism.\""\n\nWith the outside aid upon which the Gaza Strip has depended drying up and an impending humanitarian crisis enveloping the enclave, Hamas might become more willing to concede to Egyptian -- and Israeli -- demands in an attempt to garner developmental support and address criticism of its economic policies. While the majority of Gazans (64 percent) polled in 2018 supported a long-term cessation of violence with Israel that would ease the siege, any perceived political concessions are bound to feed Salafi-jihadi rhetoric. Questions concerning Hamas' commitment to the Palestinian cause thus are likely to fuel further violent challenges to the group's rule and, in turn, test its dedication to pragmatic governance."
ABU AHMED GROUP,0,"November 7, 1975. A unique day in the life of Bangladesh. At the early hours on this day, soldiers in the Dhaka Cantonment came out in force against the conspiratorial putsch staged by Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf' four days earlier. Firing with whatever personal weapons they possessed in all directions, they made it warlike. They chanted self-serving slogans, anti-officer ones being the loudest.\n\n\Being a freedom fighter,\"" said retired General Ibrahim, then a Captain, \""I was used to such firing. But the fireworks I had seen and heard that day was unprecedented.\"" Captain Ashraf of Signal Corps saw the approaching crowd shouting \""Sipai-sipai bhai, officerder rokto chai, Subedarer upore rank nai (soldier-soldier brothers, we seek the blood of officers. No rank above Subedar).\"" He quickly donned uniform, took off his rank badge and joined the crowd slanting slogans against officers. In confusion and in the darkness of the night, nobody identified the badge-less officer. He was not alone. Many officers did the same while some went hiding wherever they could. Colonel Oli ENTITY remained hidden in a paddy field for three days. Nearly two dozen officers lost their lives in the hands of the agitated and unruly troops in Dhaka alone. Another 20 casualties in other cantonments were reported. A batman killed his boss, a lady captain of the medical corps (Batman was a soldier assigned to an officer to take care of the officer's official chores, a British legacy). An angry soldier shot the wife dead when he could not find the Major at the residence. Some soldiers were kinder; they just tore the ranks off the shoulders of the officers whomever they found.\n\nMeanwhile, Major Mohiuddin and Subedar Major Anis of 2 Field Artillery Regiment led a group of their men and rescued General Ziaur Rahman from confinement at his residence, which was nearby. Outnumbered by the storming artillerymen, the guarding soldiers of 1 Bengal Regiment gave away. A reinstated Army Chief made 2 Field his headquarters for the next few\n\ndays. (In the Sylhet warfront in 1971, Captain Rashed Chowdhury founded this artillery unit as part of the Z Force of Colonel Ziaur Rahman. This unit was also in the forefront during the August 15 revolution. Major Mohiuddin was hanged in 2010 for his involvement in the August 15 Coup).\n\nOutside, the soldiers rode tanks and trucks and fanned out to the city. The general public, dismayed at Khaled's betrayal of the August 15 spirit, as well as to the nation-most of them perceived Khaled's was a pro-Indian takeover-joined the troops and paraded the city streets slanting slogans jointly, which included Sipahi-Jonota Bhai (soldiers-public brothers) and praises for President Mustique, General Ziaur Rahman and the heroes of August 15. The event thus came to be known as Sepoy-Jonota Biplop (Soldier-People Revolution). Later termed as the National Revolution and Solidarity Day, or simply National Solidarity Day (NSD), it is observed as such on November 7. It was a national holiday.\n\nHowever, the day's events were not as simple as the eyes and ears caught. A few vested and vicious forces came into play. I will come to that later. The most important thing about NSD is not what happened on that day, it is how such a serious broken discipline and dangerously chaotic situation in the ranks and file were brought under control by General Ziaur Rahman.\n\nLost Vision of NSD\n\nGeneral public attach the Sepoy-Jonota Biplop to the national unity, which was disturbed by Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf's revolt on November 3, 1975. For decades, the day received due importance under different administrations. But not under Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League. To them, it resurrected their nemesis, General Ziaur Rahman, and heralded him to be a great leader in Bangladesh. Zia's successes reminded them of the abject failures of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, their worshiped leader. To demean the importance of NSD, the Hasina administration struck it off the list of national holidays. The day passes unsung under it. It's observance and programs are not only frowned, but at times disbanded or forcibly stopped on various pretext. Sheikh Hasina could not tolerate any program that eulogized Ziaur Rahman. Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of Ziaur Rahman and other non-Awami elements, fearful of the official scowl and restriction, try to observed the day in a low key. In the process, they make a mockery of the significance of the day by shying away from mentioning how November 7 came about in the first place. It is like talking about a child without acknowledging its father. But the people are no fools. They detest such ostrich vision as displayed by today's observers of the NSD.\n\nAs one cannot discuss the independence of Bangladesh without first tracking the independence of India and its partition in 1947, one cannot also talk of National Solidarity without taking into account the November 3 and August 15 ante. The moment we talk of November 7, our immediate attention goes to November 3. And, November 3 takes us to August 15, 1975.\n\nWhat Happened on November 3\n\nOn the night of November 2, 1975, Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf, Army's Chief of the General Staff, arrested Army Chief General Ziaur Rahman and declared himself the new Chief of Army Staff. Next day, he promoted himself to a Major General. On November 5, public were entertained with a front-page image in most dailies, in which the chiefs of the Navy and the Air Force gleefully helping a beaming Khaled with his general's badge.\n\nKhaled and his cohorts tried to tell those willing to listen that their action was to restore \""the chain of command\"" that was broken on August 15, 1975. Far from convincing. On August 15, a group of young army officers brought an end to the repressive and dictatorial one-party BAKSAL (Bangladesh Krishok Sramik Awami League) regime of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to the great relief and joy of Bangladeshis. Within hours, service chiefs and Khaled Mosharraf rushed to the Radio Station to express their support and solidarity with the August 15 action.\n\nThe self-styled army chief (Khaled) demanded that President Khandakar Mushtaque ENTITY step down and turn over the August 15 officers to him. Khaled's intention was no secret to Bangabhaban, the presidential palace. He wanted to rid of those Majors who had become obstacles to his personal ambition. The president and the officers refused to comply.\n\nA power struggle ensued between Bangabhaban and Khaled's headquarters at 4 Bengal in the Dhaka cantonment. (4 Bengal was part of his K Force in the liberation war and he commanded its loyalty. But its Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Aminul Haq was a Zia loyalist. Amin was sidelined during Khaled's plan and operation). President Mushtaque, General M A G Osmany, president's Defense Adviser, and the young officers of August 15 showed great courage, prudence and restraint, even in the face of serious insolence and heightened provocations by Khaled and his cohorts.\n\nGeneral Mohammad Ataul Gani Osmany, the Chief of Mukti Bahini in 1971 and Defense Advisor to President Mushtaque ENTITY\n\nMercifully, the public life had not been disturbed. People continued their business as usual, mostly oblivious of what had been going between Khaled and Mushtaque. The most ominous lapse, however, was the total silence of the electronic media-radio and television-for almost three days, generating umpteen rumors and premonitions among the citizenry.\n\nWhy Khaled Did It\n\nKhaled Mosharraf was one of Bangladesh's brightest officers. He made glorious contributions during the liberation war in 1971. He was wounded during the closing days of the war. To say he was ambitious would not be enough. He was overambitious and could go to any lengths to fulfill his objectives.\n\n(During the war, Khaled was the Commander of Number 2 Sector, responsible for Comilla, Dhaka and part of Noakhali districts. His tactical headquarters was based close to India's eastern city of Agartala, the second most important center, after Kolkata, of the military and political activities of Bangladesh. Khaled used public relations to the fullest to augment his image by frequently inviting reporters to his headquarters. Few other commanders had the time, opportunity and interest to do so.\n\nIn July 1971, the Mukti Bahini Headquarters at Mujibnagar decided to form two conventional army brigades -- Z Force, to be commanded by Ziaur Rahman, and S Force, to be commanded by K M Safiullah- with the nuclei composed of former military personnel with superior armaments. Khaled moved heaven and earth to have a third brigade, K Force, for himself. That speaks of his ambition and how haste he was in to reach his goal.)\n\nKhaled perhaps could have reached any height he desired in the national hierarchy, had he waited for his turn. But he was impatient. He developed a personal rapport with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through his younger brother Rashed Mosharraf, an Awami League Member of the Parliament. Reportedly, he even made an overture to Sheikh Mujib, to appoint him the army chief, superseding his seniors Ziaur Rahman, Safiullah and many others.\n\nAfter the August 15, 1975 revolution, Khaled Mosharraf was the first senior officer to react positively. He came forward to help the young officers consolidate their success. He was a regular visitor to the Bangabhaban and tried to befriend the young Majors, and posed as their greatest supporter and well-wisher. Obviously, he eyed a leadership position within and outside the group, including perhaps the coveted post of the army chief, before it went to anyone else. He knew Safiullah's days as the army chief were coming to an end. But the young officers knew better.\n\nZia Honored\n\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman could not digest the fact that an unknown Major Ziaur Rahman had the \""audacity\"" to declare the Independence of Bangladesh on March 27, 1975 and stole the show. This was a task Mujib ought to have done but failed, which true to his characteristics, did not have the integrity to own. Instead, a few fake stories were released in the market to the effect that Mujib made the declaration before his arrest or surrender. None of those stories sustained because of serious inconsistencies. It has later been revealed that Mujib had no plan for an independent Bangladesh. He eyed the premiership in Islamabad while obtaining full autonomy for East Pakistan.\n\nAs a punishment to Zia, Mujib made his junior K M Safiullah the army chief. But Zia was too popular in the army to be sidelined. His peers and juniors both feared him and respected him for his honesty, discipline, assertiveness and effectiveness. Noting the consequent displeasure in the military hierarchy, a new post of Deputy Chief of Army Staff (DCAS) was created and Zia was accommodated there. Most people in the military knew that Safiullah was the titular head while the real command rested with Ziaur Rahman. He handled all matters relating to organization, administration, operation and technical. As a Staff Officer in one of the formations those days, I had seen the formation commanders would invariably endorse a copy of their letters meant for the Army Headquarters to the DCAS for immediate compliance. Ziaur Rahman became a legend, an icon but I never saw him showing it off. (Having served as one of his unit commanders in the war, I had maintained personal relationship with him even though our positions were miles apart.)\n\nThe August 15 officers thought it was time to recognize Zia's seniority, competence and his contribution to the independence of Bangladesh. On their recommendation, Ziaur Rahman was made the new army chief. Air Vice Marshal AK Khandakar was replaced by Group Captain Tawab, an efficient officer, who had gone on self-retirement in Germany since 1971. He was promoted to Air Vice Marshal. The replaced officers-Safiullah and Khandakar-were sent abroad as ambassadors.\n\nThe Conspiratorial Putsch\n\nLosing his bet with the August 15 officers, Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf devised his counter coup to satisfy his ambition and ego. Some senior officers felt dwarfed by the August 15 officers who achieved a spectacular success that the whole country welcomed. \""Missing the boat,\"" those peeved officers wanted to do something to outdo the August 15, and they bonded with Khaled Mosharraf. Brigadier Rouf, Director-General of the Defence Forces, Colonel Malek, Director of Military Operations, Colonel Shafaat Jamil, Commander of Dhaka's 46 Brigade, also joined in the conspiracy. Shafaat had four Infantry Battalions under his command: 1, 2, 4 and 22 Bengals. Lieutenant Colonels Matiur Rahman, Azizur Rahman, Aminul Haq and Abdul Ghaffar Hawladar commanded the four units respectively. Shafaat could not trust Artillery, Armour, Engineer and other service units of his Brigade. There was another reason for the desperation of these senior lots.\n\nKhaled learned that he topped the list of about 30 officers to be purged soon on various grounds. Ziaur Rahman was not involved in the preparation of the list but was kept in picture. Considering possible repercussion in hostile quarters, he went slow on the cleansing matter pending further scrutiny and advised the president accordingly. Most officers who joined Khaled belonged to that list. For them, it was now or never. The result was the November 3, 1975 putsch. Zia became the first victim.\n\nThe conspirators failed to enlist the support of most military establishments inside and outside Dhaka. Men outside their orbit could not accept Khaled's action aimed at negating the success of August 15. They also could not approve of the arrest of General Ziaur Rahman, the most popular officer at the time. Khaled relied on whatever loyal elements he could muster. He ordered 10 Bengal, another of his wartime K Force units, to move from Jessore to Dhaka. Upon arrival on November 5, it camped at the Parliament area at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar in the city. Thus, scope of his activity and support was limited. He thought if he could seize control of the Bangabhaban, the rest will fall in line. It didn't work.\n\nDuring the early hours of November 3, 1975, elements of 2, 4 and 22 Bengal quietly left the Dhaka cantonment and deployed themselves at a few strategic points that included the main thoroughfares connecting the capital with the rest of the country. Major Hafiz, Brigade Major of Shafaat's 46 Brigade, played a key role in executing Khaled's plan. (In end March 1971, Hafiz defected with parts of 1 Bengal that was deployed outside Jessore. In July, 1 Bengal re-grouped in Mymensingh and joined the Z Force. The unit was loyal to both Zia and Hafiz and was in a crossroad on November 3).1 Bengal was then guarding the Bangabhaban. Hafiz sent a message to the troops at Bangabhabon to leave the place. Captain Iqbal, Hafiz's brother-in-law, who commanded the guard detachment in Bangabhaban, readily complied. But all the troops did not obey Hafiz or Iqbal. A platoon or so still remained inside and closely guarded the president and his team. Later, elements of 2 and 22 Bengal arrived, but were not allowed in and they positioned themselves outside the perimeter. Apparently, acknowledging the shortage of his troop strength, Khaled had strict instructions not to enter into any direct confrontation with opposing forces.\n\nHafiz also said to have arranged the house arrest of Ziaur Rahman with 1 Bengal soldiers. But he was a Zia loyalist too. Reportedly, he visited the Zia family regularly during those crucial days and ensured that no harm was done to anyone. Squadron Leader Liaquat made an air show over Dhaka with a MiG-19 in solidarity with Khaled. Flight Lieutenant Iqbal Rashid and Shamsher, made a few helicopter rounds over the Bangabhaban. However, no untoward incident was reported, other than generating various rumors in public minds.\n\nAugust 15 Officers Leave Country\n\n(This is from an officer involved in August 15 Action)\n\nAt one stage, Mushtaque offered to leave the country temporarily for Khaled and Majors to sort their business. Colonels Rashid, Farook and Dalim, who had since been promoted, decided to join the president. They feared that once Khaled took control, they would be made scapegoats and face the consequences. One by one, other officers and their families also joined the bandwagon. Finally, it was decided that only the officers would leave the country, the president needed not. Mushtaque opted out.\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs frantically looked for a suitable country which would give temporary shelter to the officers. Finally, a positive response came from Thailand. A Bangladesh Biman Fokker Friendship plane was made ready to fly to Bangkok. Brigadier Mashhoor ul- Haque, the Military Secretary to the President, issued temporary Identity Cards to the officers and their family members, in absence of passports. Around 10 pm, the officers and their families were escorted to the airport. All the valuable possessions of the officers, including cash whoever had, were confiscated. Some officers had small firearms which were also taken. Lieutenant Colonel Aminul Haq, was in charge of the security clearance at the airport. \""Why are you leaving?\"" he asked an officer with whom he fought the war together and were close. \""You have no problem. It is Rashid and Farook, if any.\"" The officer was hesitant, but his batch mate and friend Major Mahbubur Rahman of the Military Intelligence, who was also at the airport, cautioned that if he stayed in the country, he could face trouble with Khaled and Co. The officer knew Mahbub was loyal to Khaled and had inside information. He took Mahbub's advice and boarded the plane with wife and their 18-month old son.\n\nAround midnight on November 3, the Fokker left Dhaka. Most officers had no idea where they headed. After a short time, it landed in Chittagong, said to be for refueling. Soldiers from local formation kept the plane cordoned. No one was allowed to leave the plane. Those inside were keeping their fingers crossed, some reciting Quranic verses assuming their doom was close. It was a scary syndrome!\n\n\""Through the window, I saw Brigadier Atiqur Rahman, the local area commander and Captain Wali, an officer with whom I fought the war,\"" said the officer of the group. \""I knew them personally. Wali and his newly married wife were close to my family when we served together in Chittagong after the war. When he saw me and my wife, he waved to us with a thumb up, signaling everything was okay. I felt confident.\"" After about an hour, which seemed too long, the plane took off. It landed at Bangkok during the early hours of the morning on November 4. \""It was the longest night,\"" recalled the officer. \""We were still confined inside the plane which was parked in an isolated place away from the tarmac with no electric connection. As sun rose high, so did the Bangkok temperature and the children kept screaming in heat and discomfort. Around 10 am, we disembarked and went to the tarmac building. Another wait till late afternoon. Meanwhile, Bangladesh Embassy people came, brought food and drinks and milk for the children. Everyone was issued with a passport \""Valid for Travel to the Kingdom of Thailand Only.\"" Temporary IDs were taken away.\n\nAfter completion of immigration formalities, we were taken to a mid-level Victoria Hotel on Silom Road. We received one hundred Thai Baht, about $4, per family per day for our subsistence. On November 7, our allowance was raised to 100 Baht per person. That was a relief and we could save some money to buy a few essentials. Our passports were re-endorsed to 'Valid for All Countries of the World, except Israel and South Africa.'\""\n\nColonel Nazmul Huda (an Agartala Conspiracy Case officer, hence had a personal loyalty to Sheikh Mujib. A nice person otherwise) rushed in from Bogra to help Khaled. Upon arrival in Dhaka, his first query was the whereabouts of the August 15 officers. When he learned that they had left the country, he immediately contacted the Dhaka Airport Control Tower and asked them to bring the plane back to Dhaka. \""It cannot be done, Sir,\"" replied the Air Controller. \""The plane is outside our airspace.\"" A tower officer later confided to another officer of the group that, in reality, at that moment, the plane was readying to take off from Chittagong. They let it go. Colonel Huda then contacted Brigadier Atiq in Chittagong and received the same response.\n\nMustaque's Resignation\n\nAfter the August 15 officers left the country on the night of November 3, Khaled offered Mushtaque to continue as president while he ran the show. It did not work. \""If I am to stay as president,\"" Mushtaque reportedly replied, \""I will be the President, not your President.\"" Brigadier Rouf and Colonel Malek went to Bangabhabon on behalf of Khaled on November 4 and 5 and unsuccessfully tried to persuade the stubborn president to resign. Later, an infuriated Colonel Shafaat took a platoon of armed soldiers and stormed the president's office and forced him to sign the resignation in presence of General Osmany on November 5. He said to have applied physical force on the elderly leaders. Shafaat, an honest and decorated freedom fighter, was politically close to Awami ideology, though he had a personal loyalty to Ziaur Rahman. He commanded 3 Bengal, one of the component units of Z Force during the war. On November 6, Chief Justice of Bangladesh, ASM Sayem, was made the new president. Mushtaque cabinet stood dissolved and the constitution suspended with the declaration of a renewed Martial Law under Khaled.\n\nClearly, the November 3 conspiracy was aimed at undoing the August 15 revolution. Opportunists in the disgraced Awami League came forward to lend support to Khaled and his cohorts. Bangladesh Intelligence arrested a few agents, identified as Indians, in Dhaka and elsewhere while they were distributing leaflets in support of Khaled. Lawrence Lifschultz, a left leaning American journalist, asserts of an Indian hand in Khaled's attempted takeover. \""Before news of the jail house murders became public on November 5th,\"" Lifschultz writes in Bangladesh: The Unfinished Revolution, p-7 (Zed Press London, 1979) \""the official Indian radio and strictly censored press greeted this second putsch with such unrestrained pleasure that few observers failed to suspect India's covert hand.\""\n\nOn November 4, Rashed Mosharraf, Khaled's brother, and their mother led a small protest march against the \""killing\"" of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to his residence at 32 Dhanmodi. They chanted slogans in favor of Khaled's coup and friendship with India. Their action did not receive much public enthusiasm and it soon died. But it had big impact on Khaled's coup. The news was flashed in most dailies the next day and the people took it granted that Khaled was an Indian agent. When Khaled learned about it, he called his mother. \""You just dug my grave, Ma,\"" Khaled moaned. Khaled was not known to be pro-Indian.\n\nJail Killing\n\nAn unfortunate incident happened on the night of November 3, 1975. A few armed soldiers entered the Dhaka Central Jail and killed four top leaders of Awami League who were in custody there. Former Vice President Syed Nazrul Islam, former Secretary General of Awami League and wartime Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmad, former Minister Mansur Ali and former Minister Qamaruzzaman were gunned down at close range. The Jail Killing episode remained shrouded in mystery and no proper investigation to the incident was carried out for a long time. Exact time of the incident has not yet been established or revealed. After more than two decades, the Hasina administration held a trial, which convicted, among others, Mushtaque-by then dead- and most of the August 15 Coup leaders. Like the Mujib Murder case, the Jail Killing was also handled in a highly political light and there existed glaring discrepancies in the investigation. It ignored the fact that the officers were out of the scene, in fact out of the country, when the incident reported to have taken place. According to investigation report, the jail authority had received a call, supposedly from the office of the president, to allow the armed soldiers inside the jail. Most analysts point fingers at Mushtaque for the gruesome act.\n\nKhaled Miscalculated the Impact of August 15\n\nThe young officers of August 15 could have easily taken on Khaled and his co-conspirators. They had the support of the troops, the majority of officers and the public at large. Most importantly, they had command of the formidable tanks and artillery guns. On the other hand, Khaled had virtually no troops with him. Infantry troops of Dhaka Brigade-1, 2, 4 and 22 Bengal-which Shafaat banked on, had divided loyalty (During the sepoy uprising on November 7, soldiers of these units also participated). President Mushtaque and General Osmany prevailed on the young officers. They did not want the onset of a civil war because of a \""stupid action\"" of Khaled, nor did they want to see any renewed bloodshed in the country. August 15 officers were persuaded to leave the country for the time being, to be brought back after the dust settled. Most importantly, the Bangabhaban leaders did not want to present a pretext to India to intervene.\n\nKhaled and his cronies miscalculated the victory and the impact of August 15. They forgot the public joy and celebration following the fall of Sheikh Mujib, and ignored how people from every walk of life came forward to welcome the August 15 revolution, hailing it as a Day of Deliverance, and how quickly the foreign governments recognized the follow-up administration under Mushtaque. They overlooked the peoples' overall satisfaction at the tremendous success achieved by the new administration in such a short time.\n\nTaher's Vicious Game\n\nAs mentioned earlier, various groups came into play in the November 7 uprising.\n\nA clandestine organization styled as Biplobi Soinik Sangstha (Revolutionary Soldiers' Organization, BSS) was in the offing in some units of the Dhaka Cantonment. It was the brainchild of Colonel ENTITY Taher, a decorated freedom fighter, who lost a leg in the war. He was released on medical ground and made chief of the Sea Truck Division of the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) at Narayanganj, east of Dhaka. A highly spirited officer, Taher was not to remain quiet or passive. He secretly joined the Marxist party of Jatiyo Samajtantric Dal (JSD) formed by ASM Abdur Rob and Major M A Jalil. A US trained commando, Taher was in charge of the underground militant faction of the party. Hasanul Haq Inu was his deputy. Through his links in the military, he tried to indoctrinate radical JSD ideology among a few chosen officers and some members in the ranks and files. Taher fought in Mymensingh area, in conjunction with Kader Siddiqui. His main target was the remnants of those freedom fighters who later formed the Rakkhi Bahini. The Rakkhi Bahini, dissolved in post-August 15, was absorbed in various units. Taher also had some followers in the Armour and Engineers. BSS took roots with the formation of a few secret cells. The main montro of its Twelve Demands was that Bangladesh would have a Biplobi Gono Bahin (Peoples' Revolutionary Army-PRA), a class-less (officer-less) military and removal of the colonial era discriminatory practices, such as Batman system. PRA was the JSD's version of Chinese Peoples' Army. Secret outfits of the BSS were in their embryonic state.\n\nJSD said to have its own plan to remove Sheikh Mujib and his BAKSAL. It was to be achieved through a nationwide popular uprising. Though it has started some propaganda works at various levels but the people were not yet ready for such radical programs. The August 15 surgical operation and its wide acceptance by the people threw them out of the plank. Some JSD leaders thought August 15 hijacked their objective.\n\nNot to be given up, Colonel Taher quickly extended his support to the August 15 group and was seen hobnobbing around the officers. He was even seen at the Mushtaque's cabinet swearing in at Bangabhaban. He insisted that Mujib's dead body should not be buried anywhere in the country; it could turn out a BAKSALi rallying point in future. He suggested that the body be thrown in the Bay of Bengal. Mujib rests at his village home in Tungipara, Faridpur. Not finding much cordiality among the August 15 officers, Taher went to concentrate on his militant plan through the BSS. Khaled's counter coup, and the general disapproval to it by the military as well as by the public presented a renewed opportunity to him.\n\nDiscipline Restored\n\nTaher came up with his 12-Point Demands, including removal of officer class. Lifschultz claims that Taher wanted to use the image of Ziaur Rahman for his uprising. His soldiers would accept only Zia. But the general was not to be sold. In a meeting of soldiers to present their demands to General Ziaur Rahman on November 8, the representative of the soldiers addressed him as Ziaur Rahman Saheb. Zia immediately and firmly corrected him saying, \""I am General Ziaur Rahman.\"" The speaker got a jolt and corrected his statement. It needed guts to challenge the agitated troops in that situation. But Zia did. Later, he addressed the troops in another gathering and asked them to surrender their weapons before he could consider their demands. \""Those who refuse,\"" Zia said in a stern tone, \""will be arrested.\"" Nobody dared to challenge Ziaur Rahman. To help him in the task, Zia recalled Brigadier M A Manzur from New Delhi, where he was the Defense Adviser in the Bangladesh High Commission, and made him the Chief of the General Staff. The discipline restored in the ranks slowly.\n\nWithin the military, there existed another closely guarded loose organization which called itself Bangladesh Sena Parishod (BSP). Its facade seemed welfare oriented and said to have a few serving and retired officers in its fold. It also claimed that some senior officers, including Ziaur Rahman, were in the know of it. If any, it was also in its infancy. Taher's Biplobi Songstha attempted to link up with the Senal Parishod and influence it with its radical ideas. Taher might have some converts but I doubt if it made any headway or created much impact, because the larger part of the military still remained disciplined and loyal to the command structure. These clandestine cells were weak and remained confined within a few non-fighting units like Signal, Ordnance and Supply. It may have infiltrated in the Engineer and Armour units in Dhaka too. Subsequent developments demonstrated that there existed some unity among troops of all units on the reform and welfare demands contained in the 12 Points. Colonel Shariful Haq Dalim, one of the August 15 leaders, claimed in his book Untold Facts that the August Coup was initiated by the BSP, that is Sena Parishod. I find it difficult to accept. An idea and operation to the magnitude, importance and precision of the August 15 could not have come from the brains a few non-descript officials. The architects of the August 15 plan, Khandakar Abdur Rashid and Farook Rahman, were never known to have any connection with the so called Sena Paarshod.\n\nKhaled's counter coup and arrest of Ziaur Rahman did not go well among the troops. Most officers also did not approve of it. Taking advantage of a general dissatisfaction among soldiers, elements of BSS and BPS contacted like-minded colleagues to initiate an uprising to undo Khaled's putsch and to realize their 12-Point demands. The idea appealed to most troops and they decided to act at the midnight of November 6. Common soldiers were largely oblivious of the BSS or BSP, much less their ideologies but they seemed united on their demands that included 'no officer class in the military.' But they seemed to accept only one officer: General Ziaur Rahman. Once started, soldiers' reaction was instantaneous and the Biplob spread like wild fire and fanned out to almost all units. In absence of a controlling body, it soon went out of control. Wild soldiers made the sky ablaze with small arms fires, as in a closely fought war. Their immediate objectives were Soldiers' Empowerment, oust Khaled and reinstate Zia. General Zia was rescued by 2 Field men and reinstated in authority in their unit. Few of those artillery soldiers had any connection with the radical elements.\n\nTaher Lost the Gamble\n\nColonel Taher was not ready for it. He had worked on a plan which did not mature yet. And, I doubt if he had any plan to rescue Zia even though Lifschultz claims so. The uncon""rolled """
ABU AHMED GROUP,0,"State Department Official Demanded Kurds Capitulate to Islamists\n\nFirst, the United States agreed to withdraw special operations forces from a section of northeastern Syria, opening the door to a Turkish invasion aimed at U.S.-allied Kurdish, Arab and Syriac Christian forces there who played a key role in defeating ISIS.\n\nNow, the State Department is demanding that those vulnerable Kurds work with Islamist forces who support the very Turkish onslaught that places them in harm's way.\n\nA top State Department official made the demand last week during a meeting with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Council (SDC) leaders, said an SDC source who was present. The Kurds were told to capitulate politically to the Muslim Brotherhood-dominated National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces (ETILAF).\n\nThat means the Kurds will not get any say in negotiations over Syria's future, but Islamists will.\n\nETILAF is based in Istanbul and closely follows the Turkish party line, including endorsing Turkey's invasion which aims to ethnically cleanse Kurds from a swath of northern Syria. It is dominated by members of Syria's Muslim Brotherhood who support a theocratic future for Syria, and have supported al-Qaida-aligned jihadists in Syria.\n\nPresident Obama recognized ETILAF as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people in 2012 even though it controls no ground in Syria. In contrast, the SDC controlled a third of Syria's territory prior to Turkey's invasion two weeks ago.\n\nIn supporting the Turkish assault, ETILAF cited \the transnational terrorism organizations which make of [sic] these areas a haven for spreading chaos, violence and terrorism,\"" in a press release about the invasion. \""The Coalition also supports the [Syrian] National Army, the Ministry of Defense and the Chief of Staff in their efforts. Syria is a platform to threaten the security and stability of Syrians and neighboring countries.\""\n\nAn Oct. 15 meeting at the State Department between Joel Rayburn, the U.S. Syria envoy, and SDC officials quickly grew heated over the U.S. direction that the Kurds work with the same people supporting Turkey's assault on them. Rayburn angrily broke a pencil in the face of SDC President Ilham ENTITY's translator after the SDC representatives reminded him of a 2016 incident when U.S. Special Forces had tried joining the fight alongside the ETILAF-supported Free Syrian Army (FSA).\n\nThese FSA fighters had threatened to kill them and shouted \""Death to America\"" at them.\n\nThe SDC members also told the State Department official they would not work with the Islamist-dominated group because they could not be trusted.\n\nState Department officials declined to comment about the meeting.\n\nDespite U.S. policies, the SDC's military arm, the Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF), continued to demonstrate its worth as an American ally when intelligence it provided helped make possible Saturday's special forces raid that killed self-appointed ISIS Caliph ENTITY Bakr al-Baghdadi. SDF spies worked with the CIA since May to track Baghdadi's movements, tracking him down to a house near the Turkish-controlled town of Jarablus, Syria, Polat Can, a top SDF adviser wrote on Twitter. They got so close that they were able to steal a pair of Baghdadi's underwear to verify his DNA.\n\n\""You don't sell out an ally like that, my God,\"" said Anne Speckhard, director of the International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism (ICSVE).\n\nSpeckhard spent considerable time in northeastern Syria getting to know ENTITY and members of the YPG/YPJ Kurdish militia, which Turkey considers part of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Turkey's contention that the militia and the PKK are the same organization and that it poses a threat to the Turks is false.\n\n\""I've worked with those YPG people; they're amazing,\"" Speckhard said. \""Anyone who can manage to put together a government that acts and looks like a democracy in the Middle East on the ashes of ISIS should be congratulated and win the Nobel Prize.\""\n\nRecent decisions have left that work in ruins.\n\nThe source from the State Department meeting named three people with Muslim Brotherhood ties with whom Rayburn demanded the SDC cooperate. They are former ETILAF President Anas al-Abdeh, former Syrian National Council President Mouaz al-Khatib and former Syrian National Council member Hassan Hachimi. All three have made public statements supportive of al-Qaida terrorists.\n\nAl-Abdeh told London-based Al-Hayat in 2016 that the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and al-Qaida-linked Jabhat al-Nusra were \""all in the same trench.\""\n\n\""We cannot differentiate between fighters,\"" al-Abdeh said.\n\nHe also opposed the Obama administration's decision in 2015 to partner with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to oust ISIS from its self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa. SDF forces lost 11,000 lives fighting to defeat al-Qaida and ISIS.\n\nHachimi and al-Khatib each made statements in late 2012 that condemned the Obama administration for declaring Jabhat al-Nusra as a terrorist organization.\n\nSpeckard's primary work involved interviewing ISIS prisoners held by the SDF.\n\n\""Everybody knows when taking a look into it that Turkey was arming ISIS and helping ISIS to fight the Kurds,\"" Speckhard said. \""That went on for years, and Turkey also let 40,000 foreign fighters stream through; they let the wounded come to be treated. Now they are back at it.\""\n\nETILAF's \""Prime Minister\"" Abdul Rahman Mustafa toured the border town of Tal Abayad on Thursday, a week after evidence showed the Turkish military using incendiary white phosphorus munitions against civilians. Mustafa also toured the headquarters of the \""Syrian National Army\"" (SNA) Third Legion. Top SNA commander Maj. Gen. Selim Idris, who endorsed al-Qaida's Syrian affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra in 2015, accompanied Mustafa on the visit. The SNA previously was known as the Free Syrian Army (FSA).\n\nThe Third Legion includes Jabhat al-Shamiya, a jihadist group considered a terrorist organization by the Dutch government. It seized homes from Christians in the town, according to an Arab news correspondent who took photos and posted them online. The legion also recently was responsible for the brutal murder and beheading of Hevrin Khalaf, a prominent Kurdish politician, early in the invasion.\n\nVideo showed another element of the Third Corps, Faylaq al-Majd, known in English as the Glory Corps, mutilating the body of a dead female Kurdish fighter.\n\nETILAF also showed its unreliability when weapons the Obama administration supplied to FSA-umbrella groups found their way into the hands of the al-Qaida affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra and ISIS.\n\nDue to last week's agreement between Turkey and Russia, an approximately 20-mile \""safe zone\"" has been imposed along the border between Syria and Turkey. The SDF was required to withdraw from the zone.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan acknowledged his desire to ethnically cleanse his 20-mile wide security zone along Turkey's border with Syria, replacing Kurds with Arabs.\n\n\""The most suitable for this area are Arabs. These areas are not suitable for the lifestyle of Kurds. Because these are virtually desert regions,\"" Erdogan told the Turkish state TV channel TRT.\n\nSo far, a supposed cease-fire Turkey agreed to has not held, despite President Trump's decision to remove economic sanctions against Turkey.\n\nSources in Syria told Speckhard on Thursday that Turkish drones continue to attack Kurdish targets and bombs continue to fall.

ABU AHMED GROUP,0,"For five years, Shorashim has facilitated meetings between Israeli settlers and Palestinians from nearby communities.\n\nPalestinian and Israeli women who took part in the Roots women's photography workshop plant a tree. (photo credit: SASKIA KEELEY)\n\nFor anyone who has lived in this country, whether Arab or Jew, the scene in the Gush Etzion region in the West Bank mid-September would have seemed nearly surrealistic. A dozen young men from a nearby yeshiva were sitting in a circle together with young Palestinian men, drinking coffee and chatting. Leading the discussion were several adults - Jewish religious settlers and devout Muslim Palestinians from neighboring towns.\n\nThe site of the gathering was a well-hidden Palestinian-owned plot of land off the main Route 60 artery and the home of a remarkable grassroots organization called Roots - Shorashim in Hebrew, Judur in Arabic. Since 2014, the not-for-profit group has facilitated interactions between Israeli Jewish settlers and Palestinians from nearby towns. They may be neighbors, but they live in parallel universes that rarely if ever cross.\n\nRoots, say the founders, was created to provide a safe space where Israelis and Palestinians could begin to understand each other's identity and daily struggles in the conflict, and \seek a path of partnership.\""\n\nIn addition to interreligious meetings for adults and youth, Roots organizes a range of activities for Israeli and Palestinian residents, including women's photography workshops, summer camps and break-fasts around religious holidays, and a summer camp for children.\n\nRoots also carries out solidarity visits to victims of violence both Palestinian and Israeli, has worked with Palestinian farmers to gain access to their farmlands adjacent to Jewish settlements, and carried out joint charity initiatives including a blood drive.\n\nThe 19-year-old Jewish participants in the meeting this particular evening are students at the nearby Machanaim Hesder Yeshiva near the town of Efrat. Machanaim is a post high-school institution that combines religious studies with service in the Israel Defense Forces. A month earlier one of their classmates, Dvir Sorek, was stabbed to death as he was returning to the yeshiva from Jerusalem. [Two Palestinian suspects have been charged with the murder.]\n\nDvir had been a member of Roots. In the wake of his murder, Palestinians in the interfaith dialogue group wrote an unprecedented condolence letter to Sorek's family and classmates expressing their shock and horror. \""As a group we condemn such brutal actions; such violence hurts all of us,\"" the letter stated. \""We build bridges between the peoples on this land and we hope that this tragedy will be the last.\""\n\nSINCE ITS founding, thousands of young Israelis have visited Roots' little oasis, many of them hearing for the first time Palestinians' views. None of Sorek's Yeshiva classmates who came to September's gathering had ever personally met any Palestinians before, and most had never heard of Roots until Sorek's death.\n\nThe \""moderators\"" of the meeting were the Roots project co-directors, Rabbi Shaul Judelman, who lives in the settlement of Tekoa, and Khaled ENTITY Awwad from the Palestinian town of Beit Ummar. A small compound has been erected on the three-dunam plot of land serving as Roots' home base. What members call \""The Field,\"" the name of a 2017 documentary on the project, or \""Ard\"" - \""the land\"" - belongs to the ENTITY Awwad family, whose members are well-known Palestinian activists with status as genuine patriots and freedom fighters.\n\nTheir mother, Fatma, was jailed by Israel for her activities in the PLO. Khaled ENTITY Awwad's brother Ali spent time in jail during the First Intifada. Another brother was shot dead by Israeli soldiers under circumstances that are still contested.\n\nAli evolved into a champion of non-violence, and was one of the founders of Roots. Khaled, one of the heads of the Israeli Palestinian Bereaved Families Forum, was awarded a UNESCO prize in 2011 for \""his efforts to promote tolerance, peace and non-violence through his work as a peace activist and leader in the reconciliation process between Palestinians and Israelis.\""\n\nRoots co-director Judelman says he believes that the organization and other movements can point the way to a model for \""more creative political solutions than just the one-state or two-state paradigm.\""\n\n\""Dvir was one of our children,\"" ENTITY Awwad said to the Yeshiva students at the September gathering. \""The murder harmed all of us. I hope this is the beginning of a continuation between us in the name of all those who lost their lives because of the hatred and the fear here. We were born here and will continue to live here, and all the violence doesn't give us anything, only pain and suffering.\""\n\nMousa Sabateen, a tour guide from Bethlehem, told the visitors: \""Once we started meeting at Roots I saw that we were all human beings. We don't want a war; we want to be with you together.\""\n\nSabateen, who had initiated the condolence letter, told them about another Palestinian member of Roots, 28-year-old ENTITY Benasra from the village of Wadi Fukin, who was shot to death by Israeli soldiers in March while trying to help a Palestinian family trapped in a car after an accident. Sabateen said it had been hard to convince Benasra to join the group because he was afraid of the settlers, but in the end found it a positive experience. \""Till now no one has written about this, people only ask me about Dvir,\"" Sabateen added. None of the yeshiva students had heard about Benasra's death.\n\nThe discussion continued in three smaller mixed groups of Palestinians and Israelis. \""My group discussed the issue of fear,\"" recalls Nitzan Fensterheim, one of Dvir's classmates. \""Both sides said they were afraid, but there was a difference in the type of fears we experienced.\""\n\nFensterheim, who grew up in Ra'anana, told The Jerusalem Report that this was the first time he had had any experience with Roots. He said the students compared notes after the meeting.\n\n\""We each took away something different,\"" said Fensterheim. \""I saw the difference between what you hear on the news and what the Palestinians themselves actually go through. For example, for me it was interesting that a lot of the Palestinians there were more interested in day to day safety than grand ideas of nationalism or statehood or where the borders should be drawn.\"" Fensterheim said he found the conversation \""eye-opening. It was actually a relief from how relations between Israelis and Palestinians are portrayed in the media.\""\n\nThese Yeshiva students will be going into the army in March, and it's entirely possible that the same Palestinians in the discussion group will be meeting them armed and in uniform at a checkpoint in the future. \""This probably went through the minds of everyone there, but it went entirely unsaid,\"" Fensterheim admitted. \""It was a fact no one cared to comment on.\""\n\nThe Jewish members of Roots may face criticism or ridicule from their fellow Israelis, but Palestinians take a far greater risk in meeting with Israelis, especially with Jewish settlers. Many do not want to be identified because they could lose their jobs. Khaled is sometimes accused of \""normalization,\"" considered a curse in Palestinian society. This has not deterred him or his family.\n\nThe Jewish activists in Roots/Shorashim/Judur include many disciples of the late Rabbi Menachem Froman from the settlement of Tekoa, a legendary activist in interfaith and peacemaking efforts. He penned the maxim \""the land does not belong to Israelis and Palestinians, but rather, Israelis and Palestinians belong to the land.\""\n\n\""I accompanied Menachem for 18 years,\"" related poet Eliaz Cohen from Kibbutz Kfar Etzion. \""He was a bulldozer, but all of his efforts never penetrated the population. For many years we searched for a Palestinian group that shared our dream.\""\n\nTHE INITIAL shidduch (match) between the Jewish and Palestinian peace activists was through John Moyle, an American pastor from the Washington area who'd been working in the West Bank as a peacemaker for years. \""He was the first person to understand that there were Jewish settlers and Palestinians living in the same area that could be brought together,\"" explains Cohen.\n\n\""After several years of studying the Arab-Israeli conflict and more importantly, building real and trusting relationships with many Israelis and Palestinians living in the West Bank, I began to realize that the great separation that had been created over time between the two peoples in the land was a central cause of the violence and conflict, and was doing literally nothing to reduce or prevent it,\"" Moyle told The Jerusalem Report. \""It became clear to me that separating Israelis and Palestinians from each other - even though they might live in neighboring communities! - made it nearly impossible for them to build relationships with each other.\""\n\nMoyle began meeting with scores of Jews and Palestinians who might be interested in getting to know each other. \""I was looking for the 'jewels,' those willing to take a risk and meet in person with those from the other side,\"" he relates.\n\nThe first meeting that would establish Roots took place in January 2014 on the ENTITY Awwad family property. In a symbolic act, Ali and Khaled ENTITY Awwad gave the Jewish visitors a key to the gate, stating \""if you need a place to bring people together to work for peace - you are welcome here.\"" Nearly 80 Jews and Palestinians from the surrounding settlements and towns took part in the first general encounter later that month, which participants would describe as \""transformative.\""\n\nOnly six months later the group faced its first real crisis. Three Jewish teenagers from Gush Etzion were kidnapped and murdered, followed by the murder of a Palestinian teen by Jewish Israelis. \""The entire area was on fire, everyone was so enraged,\"" recalls Cohen. \""That's when we realized the relationships we had developed through Roots were stronger than anything else - we found that we needed each other.\""\n\nROOTS IS supported in part by a registered nonprofit association in Geneva called B8 of Hope that today backs a dozen grassroots efforts in Israeli and Palestinian societies. Roots was the first of these.\n\nIt all started with a personal trip Mehra Beit and her husband took to Israel with their children in the summer of 2014. Both Swiss citizens, her husband is Jewish while Mehra is Muslim. Their friend Jean-Marc Liling, a Swiss human rights attorney, took them to visit the Roots compound in Gush Etzion.\n\n\""This was the time of the kidnapping and murders, but we didn't know this, though we could see he was nervous\"" Beit tells the Report via phone from Geneva. \""We went there in the middle of this madness, and met the inspiring co-founders of Roots. We were blown away that this could exist - this dialogue between Palestinians who might have been prisoners, and these religious Jewish settlers. It seemed crazy.\""\n\nOn returning to Switzerland they decided to invite representatives from Roots to talk to their friends and acquaintances about their organization.\n\n\""In Switzerland, Jews and Arabs are very friendly,\"" explains Beit. \""They socialize, and golf together, but there is an elephant in the room and they never talk about the conflict so they won't make each other uncomfortable. But we thought everyone would be at ease here because it's not about the conflict, more about the solution.\""\n\nDemand to hear the speakers was so great that they organized six presentations in synagogues, schools and Muslim centers. It was so successful that six of the couple's friends suggested setting up a nonprofit to help this \""pro-solution\"" grassroots effort to pave a path for a solution. Thus the eight - a mixture of nationalities and faiths, including Muslims and Jews - founded B8 (for Beit/Bayit) of Hope.\n\nAfter a series of workshops and lectures in Geneva, the founders decided to help other organizations.\n\n\""We thought, let's give them visibility and opportunities, because all of us are from different professions and have lots of connections,\"" explains Beit. Little by little, B8 of Hope added other not-for-profits, and is currently supporting 11 organizations including Combatants for Peace, The Jerusalem Youth Chorus, The Parents Circle Families Forum, The Road to Recovery, and Women Wage Peace.\n\n\""What is interesting to us in all these groups is the humanization effect of their activities,\"" explains Beit. \""We like movements that create unity within a society, breaking down stereotypes and bridge-building. Roots does this really beautifully.\""\n\nJudelman says he believes that the organization and other movements can point the way to a model for \""more creative political solutions than just the one-state or two-state paradigm.\""\n\nRaz Kones, a former career Israeli army officer, is coordinator of Roots' youth division.

ABU AHMED GROUP,0,"The far-right party linked to a string of murders and other violent acts once enjoyed considerable success at the ballot box.\n\nIn recent weeks, a handful of high-ranking Golden Dawn members have testified in the ongoing trial of the party, shedding light on the neo-Nazi party's internal operations and violent attacks on political opponents and migrants.\n\nIn September 2013, Golden Dawn member and cafeteria employee Giorgos Roupakias stabbed and killed 34-year-old anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas in Keratsini, a suburb of the port city Piraeus.\n\nIn the wake of Fyssas's murder, authorities cracked down on Golden Dawn, arresting dozens of members in a massive operation that targeted the party.\n\nSince April 2015, 69 Golden Dawn members- including much of the party's leadership- have been on trial for charges including allegedly operating a criminal organisation.\n\nWhat's Golden Dawn's history?\n\nIn 1980, Nikos Michaloliakos, who had a history of violent crimes and far-right activism, founded a national socialist journal called Golden Dawn.\n\nFive years later, Michaloliakos registered the political association Popular National Movement - Golden Dawn, shortly after breaking away from the ultra-nationalist National Political Union.\n\nDocuments from that period demonstrate Golden Dawn's adherence to National Socialism - the ruling ideology of Nazi Germany - and photographs show prominent members posing in front of Nazi flags and performing fascist salutes.\n\nAlthough Golden Dawn occupied the political fringes, members of the group carried out a number of attacks in the early 1990s, most notably during demonstrations over the Macedonia name dispute between Greece and its northern neighbour.\n\nFollowing the widespread upheaval over the Macedonia dispute, Golden Dawn registered as a political party in 1993.\n\nBut Golden Dawn found little success in the early years following its recognition as a political party. During the 1994 European Parliament elections, the party garnered less than a percent of the vote nationwide.\n\nIn September 1996, Golden Dawn participated in legislative elections for the first time, but the outcome was again unimpressive: the party only 4,487 votes around the country, less than a single percentage point.\n\nMeanwhile, Golden Dawn continued to build a base of hardline followers, many of them regularly engaging in violence.\n\nIn 1998, prominent Golden Dawn member Antonis Androutsopoulos participated in the brutal beating of leftwing student activist Dimitris Kousouris, who was subsequently hospitalised for severe injuries. (Years later, Androutsopoulos was convicted of attempted murder for that incident.\n\nViolence\n\nGolden Dawn christened its long wave of violence against political opponents in the early 1990s.\n\nIn December 1992, party members are believed to have executed attacks on leftists and other political opponents after massive demonstrations over the country's longstanding name dispute with its northern neighbour, Macedonia.\n\nInvestigative reporter Dimitris Psarras, author of several books on Greece's radical right, was one of the few journalists closely tracking the organisation in its early years. \They had to show that they were different,\"" he told TRT World, \""so they carried out these attacks.\""\n\nIn 1998, a prominent Golden Dawn member Antonios \""Periandros\"" Androutsopoulos assaulted Dimitris Kousouris, a leftwing student activist who had to be hospitalised owing to his injuries.\n\n\""Only then the system began to [understand],\"" Psarras explained of the 1998 incident.\n\nThe attack shocked many, but most observers still predicted that the party would not make much headway in electoral politics, pointing to its poor performance in 1994 European Parliament elections and 1996 legislative elections.\n\nThe party briefly dissolved in 2005, but party chief Nikos Michaloliakos announced in 2007 that Golden Dawn had resumed its political activities.\n\nAlthough still largely on the outskirts of Greek politics, the party gradually constructed a base of hardline supporters.\n\nWhen the global financial crisis, which started in 2009, started to send Greece's economy plummeting in 2010, Golden Dawn was confronted with an opportunity.\n\nFar-right violence targeting leftists and immigrants surged around the same time that party leader Michaloliakos landed a seat on the Athens city council in 2010.\n\nThe international watchdog Human Rights Watch documented 51 \""serious attacks\"" between August 2009 and May 2012.\n\nAs Golden Dawn and other far-right groups harnessed anti-immigrant sentiment, the number of attacks surged.\n\nIn many of the instances of violence, attackers came equipped with weapons and shouted anti-immigrant and pro-Golden Dawn slogans, the HRW report notes.\n\nHow successful has Golden Dawn been?\n\nBy the time legislative elections rolled around in May 2012, Golden Dawn had been gaining popularity - partially owing to widespread anger stemming from the country's crippling economic crisis.\n\nDuring that vote, Golden Dawn secured 6.97 percent of the vote and 21 seats, paving the way for the neo-Nazi party to enter the country's parliament for the first time in its existence.\n\nBecause the leading parties in the May vote were unable to form a government, an additional round of elections were held in June 2012.\n\nYet Golden Dawn repeated its success, gaining 6.92 percent of the vote and 18 seats in the Hellenic Parliament.\n\nIn January 2015, even as the left-wing Syriza party surged in the elections and became the lead party in the governing coalition, Golden Dawn became the third largest party in the parliament.\n\nLater that year, in September 2015, Syriza repeated its success in snap elections, and Golden Dawn retained its spot as the third largest party in the parliament.\n\nIt was not until snap elections in July 2019 that Golden Dawn lost its seats in the parliament, after failing to surpass the three-percent threshold parties must obtain to enter the Hellenic Parliament.\n\nMurders\n\nIn August 2012, a group of men on motorcycles murdered a 19-year-old Iraqi immigrant in Athens. The killing went unsolved, but authorities suspected that Golden Dawn had been involved.\n\nIn January 2013, two men stabbed to death Shahzad Luqman, a 27-year-old Pakistani migrant worker, in the capital. When police subsequently raided their homes, they found Golden Dawn pamphlets and weapons. (Both men are currently named as defendants in the ongoing trial of Golden Dawn.\n\nLater that year, in September 2013, Golden Dawn member Giorgos Roupakias fatally stabbed a 34-year-old anti-racist rapper, Pavlos Fyssas, in the Keratsini area of Piraeus.\n\nFyssas's death proved to be a turning point, and authorities belatedly clamped down on Golden Dawn. Dozens of members -- including most of the party's leadership -- were arrested and slapped with a host of charges.\n\nThe trial\n\nAlthough the trial initially did little to detract from Golden Dawn's support, the legal proceedings have been costly.\n\nAdditionally, worrisome revelations that have emerged throughout the trial detail the extent of the party's involvement in organised violence and potentially criminal activities.\n\nThroughout the trial, a harrowing theme has been the complicity of many locals and Greek authorities during the bloodiest periods of far-right violence.\n\nIn 2016, migrant fishermen from Egypt testified about Golden Dawn attacks four years prior in Perama.\n\nExplaining that he and others were targeted because they were foreign-born nationals, Egyptian fish shop owner ENTITY ENTITY Hamad recalled 15 black-clad men arriving at a home where he lived with several others in June 2012.\n\n\""I saw them face-to-face,\"" he said, as reported by the Greek daily Kathimerini at the time, adding that he believed his attackers targeted them because \""we are Muslims, dark-skinned and they want us out of the country\"".\n\nTapped phone calls entered into evidence have revealed close ties between Golden Dawn members and some Greek police officers.\n\nIn recent weeks, high-ranking Golden Dawn members have taken the stand and attempted to deflect responsibility for members' actions.\n\nParty leadership has also sought to downplay Golden Dawn's links to neo-Nazi ideology.\n\nGolden Dawn member Ilias Panagiotaros, a former parliamentarian, addressed the court earlier this month, claiming that the party had banned supporters from using the Nazi salute, Kathimerini reported.\n\nAnother former Golden Dawn parliamentarian, Kostas Barbarousis, contradicted Panagiotaros when he said the fascist salute was \""the best there is\"" and had been unfairly \""demonised\"".\n\nAs the party has began to dissolve in the wake of its poor performance in July elections, some analysts believe the infighting has turned many formerly loyal members against one another.\n\nGolden Dawn leader Michaloliakos has consistently denied accusations that the party had played a central role in organising violence. Rather, he claims that the ongoing prosecution was part of an effort to clamp down on the party for its ultra-nationalist politics."

His family claimed to descend from the Prophet Muhammad's tribe, which made it possible for al-Baghdadi to later become the leader of the Islamic caliphate.\n\nHe took to a conservative interpretation of Islam early in his life and received an undergraduate degree from the Shariah College of University of Baghdad in 1996. Three years later, he earned a master's degree in Koranic recitation from the Saddam University for Islamic Studies.\n\nHe interrupted his doctorate work to join the fight against American forces after the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nAl-Baghdadi, whose nom de guerre was then \""ENTITY Dua,\"" was arrested at the home of his parents-in-law near Falluja in January 2004. His brother-in-law, who'd been fighting the American invasion of Iraq, was the target of the raid. Al-Baghdadi was ultimately detained at Camp Bucca, which housed tens of thousands of Iraqis in communal tents, for 11 months.\n\n\""He was a street thug when we picked him up in 2004,\"" an anonymous Pentagon official told The New York Times in 2014. \""It's hard to imagine we could have had a crystal ball then that would tell us he'd become head of ISIS.\""\n\nExperts say Al-Baghdadi's stay at the detention center helped facilitate his radicalisation and served as a planning headquarters for ISIS. He was chosen as a leader by fellow prisoners in the camp, making alliances with other Sunni prisoners and former Iraqi Baathists.\n\nIt was there that al-Baghdadi met and became a follower of Jordanian jihadist, ENTITY Musab al-Zarqawi, who would go on to lead al-Qaeda in Iraq.\n\n\""We could never have all got together like this in Baghdad, or anywhere else,\"" ENTITY, a jihadist imprisoned with al-Baghdadi at Camp Bucca, told The Guardian in 2014. \""It would have been impossibly dangerous.

And the American ouster of Saddam Hussein, whose brutal dictatorship had kept a lid on extremist Islamist movements, gave Mr. Baghdadi the freedom for his radical views to flourish.\""\n\nThe US military released him in December 2004.\n\nFor years, very little was known about al-Baghdadi. He served as a religious adviser to al-Qaeda terrorist cells in Iraq. As US forces dealt significant blows to al-Qaeda's leadership, the spiritual instructor rose to become the top leader in 2010 of what was then the Islamic State of Iraq.\n\nThe Arab Spring, which began in late 2010, and the civil war in Syria, which began in early 2011, provided his weakened group with new motivation, fighters, and weapons.

It carried out or inspired terrorist attacks that have killed thousands in countries around the world and became perhaps best known for its extraordinarily brutal, gruesome murder and torture of its prisoners, including Americans.\n\nThose attacks included suicide bombings at a Sri Lankan church on Easter Sunday this year, the massacre at a German Christmas market in 2016, and the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernadino, California.\n\nThe group used the internet to build networks of support around the world, enforced extreme religious rules inspired by Islamic theocracies in the Middle Ages, and brutally targeted religious minorities, including the Yazidis.\n\nAl-Baghdadi personally promoted and participated in the systematic rape of women who ISIS considered non-believers, including an American ISIS captive, Kayla Mueller, who al-Baghdadi kept as one of several of his sex slaves. ISIS reported Mueller was killed in a Jordanian airstrike in 2015.\n\nWhile the Islamic State has lost control of virtually all of its territory, there remain widespread fears that the group will re-emerge or morph into a new terrorist movement, and that its ideas will not die along with its leaders."
ABDULKARIM GROUP,1,"BEIRUT (AP) -- The American pullback from parts of northeastern Syria could help breathe new life into the Islamic State ENTITY if fighting erupts between the Kurds and Turkey.\n\nSyrian Kurdish authorities are already struggling to guard IS fighters captured during the long U.S.-backed campaign against the militants and to keep a lid on IS supporters and family members thronging displacement camps. Their hold will suffer even more if they are fighting Turkey.\n\nThe White House has said Turkey will take over responsibility for the thousands of imprisoned fighters. But it is not clear how that will happen, if it all, given that the Kurdish forces are Turkey's nemesis.\n\nTurkey is sending troops along the border in preparation for an offensive against the Syrian Kurds. Ankara has said it wants to impose a zone of control potentially 30 kilometers (19 miles) deep that would stretch the length of the border. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have vowed to fight back.\n\nHere is a look at what is at stake and why IS stands to gain.\n\nMILITANTS IN DETENTION\n\nAngered by the sudden pullback of U.S. troops, Kurdish officials sounded the alarm that, to fight any Turkish assault, they will have to divert their forces away from guarding IS prisoners. That raises security concerns at a time when the Islamic State ENTITY's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has called on followers to do all they can to free captured fighters held in jails and families living in camps.\n\nKurdish authorities run more than two dozen detention facilities, scattered around northeastern Syria, holding about 10,000 IS fighters. Among the detainees are some 2,000 foreigners, including about 800 Europeans.\n\nMost of the facilities are unidentified and unmarked, some of them set up in abandoned or repurposed buildings; others are mobile \pop-up prisons.\"" Some are reportedly close to the border, which may make them vulnerable to being hit in clashes or bombardment.\n\nGuarding those facilities has long been a strain on the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces as it juggles multiple tasks in the volatile area. The U.S-led coalition has said the force doesn't have the capacity to detain thousands of fighters on its own -- and the coalition may be helping to hold some of the most high-level militants.\n\nHandling the prisons while defending against Turkish troops will be even more difficult.\n\n\""How will I even protect these facilities?\"" ENTITY Omar, a senior Kurdish official, said. \""The Turkish attack is an existential threat. (The Kurdish) forces will be busy with fending it off.\""\n\nAt least two prison facilities, including a former government prison, are located in Qamishli and Hassakeh, where Syrian government forces maintain a presence, even though the cities are largely administered by the Kurdish-led ENTITY.\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian fighters who will likely join any Turkish offensive may have links or sympathies with the local IS detainees. The Rojava Information Center, a pro-SDF research ENTITY based in the Kurdish-held areas, said it has documented at least 40 former IS fighters now in the Turkish-backed forces. Foreign fighters who joined IS originally found their way to Syria through Turkey, and it was widely believed Turkish authorities turned a blind eye at the time.\n\nFAMILIES IN DISPLACEMENT\n\nAn outbreak of fighting would also likely mean laxer control over the three Kurdish-run camps holding IS families and die-hard supporters that are potential engines for recruitment for the ENTITY. The Kurdish-led forces have already been struggling to secure them and provide humanitarian aid in the often chaotic camps.\n\nThe camps are farther away from the border and outside the safe zone Turkey wants to create, so it is not clear how Turkey would take control of them. It is highly unlikely the Syrian Democratic Forces would coordinate with Ankara to hand them over.\n\nThe largest, al-Hol, houses nearly 70,000 people, including over 11,000 foreign women and children from 40 different countries. Two smaller camps, Roj and Ain Eissa, house just over 2,000 foreign women and children.\n\nThe camps are rife with IS support. Al-Hol has been called the cradle for a new militancy, and the coalition has said IS is actively recruiting new members there. Some of the foreign women have organized an IS-style religious police to impose their own rules, often using violence, and children are often radicalized in the camps.\n\nSLEEPER CELLS\n\nDespite its territorial defeat, IS has maintained an insurgency in Iraq and Syria, carrying out suicide bombings, assassinations and ambushes. Some reports suggest 14,000 to 18,000 IS members remain in Syria and Iraq, including 3,000 foreigners, but a recent report by the inspector general of the Department of Defense said figures from experts greatly vary.\n\nIS militants have carried out 80 to 90 attacks in Kurdish-held areas of Syria. In August alone, IS militants claimed 78 attacks, according to the Rojava Information Center, including the assassination of Kurdish fighters and explosive devices planted near patrols. The ENTITY has also been reviving financial networks through extortion, \""taxing\"" the local population or collecting ransoms from kidnapping.\n\nIS could also easily exploit tension between Kurdish-led forces and Arab tribes, for instance, over control of the resources in the oil-rich east, to recruit new members.\n\nDareen Khalifa, a Syria analyst with the Brussels-based International Crisis ENTITY, said a Turkish operation against the Kurdish forces would destabilize the northeast, create a new wave of displaced and refugees near the border and divert the local Kurdish forces from fighting the remnants of IS -- \""potentially enabling them to regain their potency and expand to other areas.\"""

But it is not clear how that will happen, if it all, given that the Kurdish forces are Turkey's nemesis.\n\nREAD MORE: US troops start pullout from along Turkey's border in Syria\n\nTurkey is sending troops along the border in preparation for an offensive against the Syrian Kurds. Ankara has said it wants to impose a zone of control potentially 30 kilometers deep that would stretch the length of the border. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have vowed to fight back.\n\nHere is a look at what is at stake and why IS stands to gain.\n\nThis March 30, 2018 file photo shows a Kurdish security officer taking off face masks from Alexanda Amon Kotey, left, and El Shafee Elsheikh, who were allegedly among four British jihadis who made up a brutal Islamic State cell dubbed \The Beatles,\"" for an interview at a security center in Kobani, Syria. (HUSSEIN MALLA / AP)\n\nMILITANTS IN DETENTION\n\nAngered by the sudden pullback of US troops, Kurdish officials sounded the alarm that, to fight any Turkish assault, they will have to divert their forces away from guarding IS prisoners. That raises security concerns at a time when the Islamic State ENTITY's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has called on followers to do all they can to free captured fighters held in jails and families living in camps.\n\nKurdish authorities run more than two dozen detention facilities, scattered around northeastern Syria, holding about 10,000 IS fighters. Among the detainees are some 2,000 foreigners, including about 800 Europeans.\n\nMost of the facilities are unidentified and unmarked, some of them set up in abandoned or repurposed buildings; others are mobile \""pop-up prisons.\"" Some are reportedly close to the border, which may make them vulnerable to being hit in clashes or bombardment.\n\nGuarding those facilities has long been a strain on the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces as it juggles multiple tasks in the volatile area. The US-led coalition has said the force doesn't have the capacity to detain thousands of fighters on its own -- and the coalition may be helping to hold some of the most high-level militants.\n\nHandling the prisons while defending against Turkish troops will be even more difficult.\n\nALSO READ: Turkey: 2 million to be resettled in northern Syria's safe zone\n\n\""How will I even protect these facilities?\"" ENTITY Omar, a senior Kurdish official, said. \""The Turkish attack is an existential threat. (The Kurdish) forces will be busy with fending it off.\""\n\nAt least two prison facilities, including a former government prison, are located in Qamishli and Hassakeh, where Syrian government forces maintain a presence, even though the cities are largely administered by the Kurdish-led ENTITY.\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian fighters who will likely join any Turkish offensive may have links or sympathies with the local IS detainees. The Rojava Information Center, a pro-SDF research ENTITY based in the Kurdish-held areas, said it has documented at least 40 former IS fighters now in the Turkish-backed forces. Foreign fighters who joined IS originally found their way to Syria through Turkey, and it was widely believed Turkish authorities turned a blind eye at the time.\n\nIn this March 31, 2019 photo, women shop in the marketplace at Al-Hol camp, home to families of Islamic State fighters, in Hasakeh province, Syria. (MAYA ALLERUZZO / AP)\n\nFAMILIES IN DISPLACEMENT\n\nAn outbreak of fighting would also likely mean laxer control over the three Kurdish-run camps holding IS families and die-hard supporters that are potential engines for recruitment for the ENTITY. The Kurdish-led forces have already been struggling to secure them and provide humanitarian aid in the often chaotic camps.\n\nThe camps are farther away from the border and outside the safe zone Turkey wants to create, so it is not clear how Turkey would take control of them. It is highly unlikely the Syrian Democratic Forces would coordinate with Ankara to hand them over.\n\nThe largest, al-Hol, houses nearly 70,000 people, including over 11,000 foreign women and children from 40 different countries. Two smaller camps, Roj and Ain Eissa, house just over 2,000 foreign women and children.\n\nThe camps are rife with IS support. Al-Hol has been called the cradle for a new militancy, and the coalition has said IS is actively recruiting new members there. Some of the foreign women have organized an IS-style religious police to impose their own rules, often using violence, and children are often radicalized in the camps.\n\nThis April 3, 2018 file photo shows prisoners playing volleyball in a Kurdish-run prison housing former members of the Islamic State ENTITY, in Qamishli, north Syria. (HUSSEIN MALLA / AP)\n\nSLEEPER CELLS\n\nDespite its territorial defeat, IS has maintained an insurgency in Iraq and Syria, carrying out suicide bombings, assassinations and ambushes. Some reports suggest 14,000 to 18,000 IS members remain in Syria and Iraq, including 3,000 foreigners, but a recent report by the inspector general of the Department of Defense said figures from experts greatly vary.\n\nIS militants have carried out 80 to 90 attacks in Kurdish-held areas of Syria. In August alone, IS militants claimed 78 attacks, according to the Rojava Information Center, including the assassination of Kurdish fighters and explosive devices planted near patrols. The ENTITY has also been reviving financial networks through extortion, \""taxing\"" the local population or collecting ransoms from kidnapping.\n\nIS could also easily exploit tension between Kurdish-led forces and Arab tribes, for instance, over control of the resources in the oil-rich east, to recruit new members.\n\nDareen Khalifa, a Syria analyst with the Brussels-based International Crisis ENTITY, said a Turkish operation against the Kurdish forces would destabilize the northeast, create a new wave of displaced and refugees near the border and divert the local Kurdish forces from fighting the remnants of IS -- \""potentially enabling them to regain their potency and expand to other areas."

Muhammad Ali,0,"On Saturday, Regis Prograis will put his WBA junior welterweight title on the line against IBF counterpart Josh Taylor in an eagerly anticipated unification match-up in the final of the World Boxing Super Series. The winner will be crowned The Ring Magazine champion and also collect the prestigious ENTITY Trophy at the O2 Arena, London, on DAZN, at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET.\n\nPrograis, who is rated No. 1 by The Ring at 140 pounds, turned professional in the spring of 2012 after a solid amateur career. He steadily built his career over the next couple of years before creating a buzz with some impressive displays on \ShoBox,\"" notably against Abel Ramos (RTD 8) and Joel Diaz Jr. (TKO 2). The 30-year-old's rise continued when he stopped former unified beltholder Julius Indongo (TKO 2) inn March of last year. \""Rougarou\"" entered the WBSS as the No. 1 seed and has since bested Terry Flanagan (UD 12) and stopped Kiryl Relikh (TKO 6) to win the WBA title.\n\nTaylor, who is rated No. 2 by The Ring, was a top amateur, winning silver at the 2010 Commonwealth Games before upgrading to gold in 2014. He also represented his country at the 2011 and 2013 World Championships and fought at the 2012 Olympics. The 28-year-old has moved quickly since transitioning to the professional game in 2015, scoring eye-catching wins over previously unbeaten Ohara Davies (TKO 7), former lightweight titlist Miguel Vazquez (KO 9) and former junior welterweight kingpin Viktor Postol (UD 12). Taylor has beaten Ryan Martin (TKO 7) and Ivan Baranchyk (UD 12) to win the IBF title in the WBSS tournament.\n\nBoth men are southpaws. Who will deal with that better? Both are renowned body-punchers. Who is able to employ hi body-attack better? This is the best opponent either has faced to date, Who will handle that better? Will home advantage play a part?\n\nOnline gambling group William Hill lists Prograis as a 6/10 (-167) favorite, while Taylor is priced at 13/10 (+130); the draw is 20/1 (+2000).\n\nTOM GRAY: TAYLOR SD\n\nI picked Taylor to win the WBSS and I'm sticking to it as we enter the final. The Scotsman has wonderful skills, juxtaposed alongside toughness, spite and punching power. There is no question that Prograis is Taylor's most formidable opponent to date. The American is an excellent technician, who matches Taylor for hand speed and power. However it's Taylor's foot speed and distance control that are likely to get him over the line. I don't foresee a shootout, a knockout or even a knockdown. I envision 12 rounds of high-quality combat and it will be a joy to watch. This is just the beginning for both men.\n\nMICHAEL WOODS: PROGRAIS SD\n\nThe winner, with a solid outing, could be getting more pound-for-pound talk. Hey now - another coin flip fight! I may be inclined to give Regis more love because of familiarity, as I contemplate the comparison of assets. Both men are stepping up, will see skill sets a notch above anything they've dealt with. Expect even rounds, a split decision...Prograis by a hair.\n\nMARTY MULCAHEY: TAYLOR UD\n\nJosh Taylor and Regis Prograis are two boxer/punchers entering the fight on equal highs, given the WBSS format. The small things and intangibles will make the difference. I lean toward Taylor, given the fight in his territory and Taylor holds advantages in height, reach and bigger overall build. More importantly Taylor knows how to use these advantages. Key, for me, is the composure Taylor showed deconstructing the bullying style of Ivan Baranchyk in his last outing. Yes, Prograis is much better and quicker but I don't see Prograis sustaining pressure on Taylor, whose feet are undervalued. Taylor has bested a wider array of styles and his movement will cause hesitation in a Prograis, who thrives when in rhythm. Much like the Errol Spence-Shawn Porter fight, Prograis lands some big shots but is unable to outbox Taylor, who maintains distance picking him apart for a unanimous decision win.\n\nANSON WAINWRIGHT: TAYLOR MD\n\nTwo terrific fighters and competitors. Another tough fight to pick, I've gone back and forth on this one. Ultimately I can't see Prograis winning on the road in what is perceived as Taylor's backyard. It will be difficult for Prograis to separate himself enough in a close fight to win. Both guys will have their moments but Taylor will win a hard-fought majority decision.\n\nGARETH A. DAVIES: PROGRAIS SD\n\nTaylor vs. Prograis is a genuine 50/50 pick 'em fight. There is little to separate the two men in terms of how they have performed as they stepped up, in their respective styles, and in the unshakeable self-belief they both have in the ring and as men. If I have to crawl off the fence, I am going to pick Prograis based on the explosive power he possesses, which can change the course of a fight. Prograis may put Taylor down. For me, Taylor can be drawn into a war, in spite of not needing to do so, being highly skilled and technical. But this will be a war and unless Taylor imposes himself - which he may do - Prograis ekes a razor-tight decision. It would not surprise me if it were controversial too. Prograis, victor by split points decision.\n\nNORM FRAUENHEIM: PROGRAIS UD\n\nIt might be the toughest fight to pick this year. That might make it 'Fight of the Year.' Josh Taylor, a Scotsman, has momentum. He has power. And he'll have the crowd at O2 Arena but does he have enough in his skill set to counter all that Prograis can do and does? Over 12 rounds, Prograis will throw a lot of different looks and punches from different angles, all enough to take control in the later rounds of a fight he wins in a close yet unanimous decision.\n\nBOXING INSIDERS\n\nMIKE ALTAMURA (MANAGER): TAYLOR UD\n\nGreat fight between two high-class southpaws. Taylor is technically more polished but Prograis is definitely the more physical in the fight. If Taylor can nullify Prograis' strength inside, I see him edging a tightly contested bout.\n\nJOSE RAMIREZ (WBC/WBO JUNIOR WELTERWEIGHT TITLIST): PROGRAIS PTS\n\nI think it's a very tough fight for both fighters. I think it's a very competive fight, two different styles and we'll see who is the better man that night. I think Prograis is the hungrier fighter of the two but I think Taylor is the more technical. I'd be delighted to fight either one of them in the near future, so we can put all the titles on the line to have an undisputed champion in 2020. It's a 50/50 fight. I'm going with Prograis, I think it's definitely going to go the distance.\n\nDUKE MCKENZIE (FORMER THREE-DIVISION TITLEHOLDER/TV ANALYST): TAYLOR UD\n\nPrograis and Taylor is a mouth-watering fight. I'm hard-pushed to pick a winner. I like Prograis; he does more right than wrong but the smart money has to be Taylor, who looks like he's at his peak now. Taylor is very intelligent; he picks his punches well. Let's hope this fight doesn't end via cuts. I think Taylor wins a unanimous points decision.\n\nKATHY DUVA (PROMOTER, MAIN EVENTS): PROGRAIS UD\n\nPrograis-Taylor is such a good fight but I think that Prograis might be a bit more technically proficient at this point. Taylor will certainly bring it and so the fight should go the limit, with Prograis willing a close unanimous decision.\n\nRICKY HATTON (FORMER TWO-DIVISION WORLD TITLIST/TRAINER): PROGRAIS PTS\n\nThis is a tough one to call. They are both unbeaten with a great knockout rate. It'a genuine 50/50 fight and potentially one of the best fights for 2019. Prograis has an impressive record of wins at the top level but Josh has shown he is world-class as well in his recent fights. London is almost home advantage for Josh and that could be a big factor with the judges but I'm going for Prograis by points.\n\nCAMILLE ESTEPHAN (PROMOTER, EYE OF THE TIGER): TAYLOR UD\n\nI believe it will be close, hard-fought rounds. I believe Taylor is the man to beat currently in the division. I think Taylor by unanimous decision.\n\nRONNIE SHIELDS (TRAINER): PROGRAIS\n\nI've known Regis for a very long time, even before he turned professional. He's a good kid; he's a strong fighter and very confident fighter. It's going to be tough for Josh Taylor because Regis is walking through guys right now. I think, right now, he's going to be too strong for Josh. Josh is a good fighter in his own right. I just think it's Regis' time.\n\nSERGIO MORA (FORMER WORLD CHAMPION/COMMENTATOR): PROGRAIS PTS\n\nI've been looking forward to this one some time now. Both southpaws are high IQ fighters. I really like Taylor's skills but I like Prograis by decision. It'll be competitive until the end.\n\nVADIM KORNILOV (MANAGER): TAYLOR\n\nI think that it's a very competitive fight. We had Postol fight Taylor; he is very strong and technically sound. Prograis also has great punching power. I think it's a 50/50 fight but would give Taylor the edge.\n\nFRANK WARREN (PROMOTER, QUEENSBURY PROMOTIONS): TAYLOR\n\nIt's going to be a great fight. I watched Prograis live vs. Flanagan in New Orleans and he was very impressive. Strong, aggressive and very clever inside. Picks his shots well. Taylor is in for a long night if he gets into a brawl but if he boxes like we all know he can and doesn't get drawn in to a scrap, I fancy him to come out on top via a close decision. Keep it long and off the jab.\n\nMICHAEL AMOO-BEDIAKO (TRAINER): PROGRAIS PTS\n\nThis is a very interesting fight, two southpaws, which takes away both of their advantages. I like Josh Taylor a lot. He's very well-schooled and has a great style albeit when he fights orthodox fighters, good amateur background aligned with a very good trainer in Shane McGuigan, who will always bring him ready with an excellent game plan. Regis Prograis, to me, is a little bit more rugged but has that much more experience and is very confident in his own ability. He seems unfazed no matter who's in front of him and has that patience about him to pick his shots well without wasting a lot of energy. He totally out-boxed Terry Flanagan, another southpaw, which I think gives him the slight advantage in this fight. I think it's a very close fight but I take Prograis on points as he just has that little bit more experience and this fight may have just come a bit too soon for Taylor but a very close fight.\n\nRICK MIRIGIAN (MANAGER): PROGRAIS TKO\n\nI think Prograis stops Taylor late and overwhelms him with physicality and heart. Prograis has a better resume so far, more fights and there is no substitute for heart. Then he comes back to the USA and gets knocked out and gives (Jose) Ramirez both belts - we don't want the the fake ones; (Prograis) can keep those for his house or give to Dereck Chisora for Christmas - next year and retires and opens an alligator farm in New Orleans.\n\nSTEPHEN EDWARDS (TRAINER): TAYLOR SD\n\nThis is a tough fight to call. Prograis is really clever with his pressure. He also throws hard, straight, short punches that do more damage than people realize. He has solid defense for an offensive fighter. Taylor, in my opinion, is struggling to make weight. There is a look to his body that I don't like but I am very high on Taylor. My gut feeling tells me Taylor will move his feet more than we expect and get the nod in a tight, controversial, draw-ish type of fight. Don't be surprised if this is a draw but my official pick is Taylor by split decision.\n\nWAYNE MCULLOUGH: (FORMER WORLD CHAMPION/TRAINER): TAYLOR PTS\n\nInteresting fight with both unbeaten and also southpaws. Prograis likes to be aggressive, which should suit Taylor. Prograis has a good straight left and hurtful left shot to body, so Taylor will have to be aware of that and block them with his right elbow nice and tight to his body with his hand covering his head, then come straight back with a straight left to the head or body or a right hook to the head or body of Prograis. If he can do this and hurt Prograis, he will control the fight and box his way to a close points win. Tough fight either way."
Kamal Mustafa,1,"Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) Chairman Syed ENTITY said that he has been accused of unlawful allotment of a plot of land while the fact is that neither any sort of allotment was made nor he had any powers to exercise in that context and hence the overall case is baseless as it never occurred in his life. It is just like someone is alleged of murder of a particular person while he is still alive.\n\nHe was talking to the newsmen outside the national Accountability Court here in Karachi, Saturday. While speaking on other anomalies that have gripped this mega city, the revenue engine of Pakistan, the port city of Karachi, ENTITY said that it happens today that the apex court has to intervene in even petty issues while those mega issues are out questions. The apex court has to take suo moto notice of a dog-bite case, as well, which is so deplorable on the part of the civil administration.\n\nThe PSP Chairman ENTITY said that people are starving due to skyrocketing prices of common men's commodities and even they are on the verge of starvation and are forced to commit suicide.\n\nOn the issue of corruption in the country, he was of the opinion that the menace of corruption has despite gigantic measure for curbing by the federal government, it has drastically spread in nook and cranny of departments and instead it should have been curbed the rates of bribe have immensely increased.\n\nThere is everywhere a panic-like situation and widespread unrest everywhere and it is uncertain which direction the country is being driven to. The menace of corruption is eating the country like termites and even the funds for the procurement of astray dog culling poison is also being embezzled. Nobody is concerned on ten to twenty deaths from rabies that resulted from astray dog bites. There are numerous dog bite cases being reported daily in Karachi but the anti-rabies vaccines and dog culling steps are missing.\n\nHe said that the Prime Minister had during his visit to Karachi avoided meeting the people of the city and he had described a variety of key issues of Karachi that he forgot with this return of Islamabad such as issuance of CNIC to Afghans and Bengalis, lack of Master Plan for the port city, which he (PSP Chairman) had personally prepared when he was the Nazim of the city in 2007. The Karachi Package to the tune of Rs.162bln is yet to come to the city, he deplored, adding that the pm had inaugurated a university for Hyderabad city at PM House in Islamabad and the University is still being looked for on ground.\n\nHe said that deaths from electrocution due to ineligibility of K-Electric are rampant in the city while the PM could not ask his friend, Arif Naqvi of K-Electric as what he was doing with the people of Karachi.\n\nENTITY said that Karachi needs greater water supply project, K-IV but sadly the Sindh provincial government has decided to close that programme after spending Rs.25bln on it and the contractors heavily benefited in this project.\n\nThe PSP Chairman said that the provincial government is making attempts to privatise the Karachi water and sewerage Board while water facility has never been kept on hands of private operators across the world. This act would be tantamount to collective suicide, he deplored."

Kamal Mustafa,0,"IPOH (Oct 3): Conducting a study on whether to reintroduce the Goods and Services Tax (GST) does not mean the Government will implement the system again; instead, it will depend on what the people want, said Deputy International Trade and Industry Minister Dr Ong Kian Ming.\n\nHe said everyone needed to understand the context of Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad's statement after he was asked whether the Government would reintroduce the GST system, which was replaced by the current Sales and Service Tax (SST) on Sept 1 last year.\n\n\In response to an economist's suggestion that we should perhaps study it, Tun Dr Mahathir said we could study it if the people want the GST to be reinstated.\n\n\""However, if the people do not want a return to the old system, the people's voice will be heard and it will not be brought back,\"" he told reporters after a \""turun padang\"" (going-down-to-the-ground) programme during which he visited M&S Food Industries Sdn Bhd in Silibin followed by SYW Industries Sdn Bhd in Menglembu here today.\n\nOng explained that the Prime Minister was not calling for the GST to be reintroduced but was only giving his view when asked about the proposal.\n\n\""His view is that we should assess whether the people want the policy back,\"" he said.\n\nEarlier this week, Malaysian Institute of Economic Research chairman Tan Sri Dr ENTITY Salih was reported as saying the Government should reintroduce the GST in Budget 2020 but at a lower rate of three percent. The proposal was one of the items on MIER's budget wish list.\n\nMeanwhile, today's programme was an effort by Malaysian Industrial Development Finance Bhd's (MIDF) Development Finance Division (DFD) to promote its financing schemes and create awareness to encourage local entrepreneurs to work together with government agencies.\n\nAmong others, it showcased MIDF's achievements in improving the small and medium enterprises' contribution to the economy for certain sectors or industries targeted by the Government through its various loan schemes.\n\nAlso present during the programme was DFD head Azizi ENTITY.\n\nOng expressed hope that SME manufacturers, in migrating towards Industry 4.0, would seek financing support from MIDF to help them increase their productivity and performance.\n\nSince 2008, MIDF has approved 2,090 loans totalling RM2.65 billion to SMEs in the manufacturing and service sectors for the northern region -- covering Perak, Penang, Kedah and Perlis -- to help develop local businesses.\n\nMIDF has, since its establishment in 1960, assisted 11,102 local companies with approved financing totalling RM15.15 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in Kedah, Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia deputy president Datuk Seri Mukhriz Tun Mahathir said the Government would take into account the views of everyone, especially the public, before making any move to reintroduce the GST.\n\n\""The people's interest is given much importance; that's why we will listen to their views in addition to those of the economic experts.

AGUIRRE SANCHEZ,1,"Because America has deported something deadly: its opioid crisis.\n\nJulio Moreno is 31. He's been using drugs since the age of 12. Living in the Mexican border city of Mexicali, he's seen it all: heroin, cocaine, crack, meth, marijuana. But in September this year, Moreno tried something for the first time: fentanyl.\n\n\It really knocked me out, but it's better than heroin,\"" he told OZY on a recent Sunday morning at the local outreach center, Verter, where he goes to exchange his old syringes for new ones. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid at least 50 times stronger than heroin and gives users a stronger high. The biggest cause of drug overdoses in the United States in 2019, fentanyl has now crossed the border into Mexico, where those who work with drug users are seeing overdoses spike.\n\nOfficial figures in Mexico reported only six fentanyl overdoses in 2015. In 2017, they reported 37 -- but that's likely the tip of the iceberg. This week, Mexico President Andr�s Manuel L�pez Obrador (AMLO) announced that addiction is now a major focus for his administration due to the scale of the problem.\n\n\""This is all you're going to be hearing and seeing on the radio and on television and in the newspapers -- only this for a while. And going forward ... we are going to dedicate a day a week showing advances in our plan: why fentanyl is spreading, its effects, everything,\"" he said.\n\nRicardo Mej�a Berdeja, Mexico's deputy director of public security, said that growing consumption of the synthetic opioid is a new problem: \""It's mostly invading the North American market, but now it's damaging our country too.\""\n\nAn OZY investigation reveals that fentanyl is part of a two-pronged crisis that's turning the country -- traditionally known more as a route for narcotics meant for the U.S. -- into a bigger domestic market for drugs than ever before. With American authorities under the Trump administration tightening border security and cracking down on the production of illicit drugs in their territory, Mexican cartels are increasingly flooding their homeland instead with fentanyl and methamphetamine, another synthetic drug.\n\n\""We're going to get to the root of this, getting rid of the cancer of addiction, as a way of taking resources out of criminal organizations that get money and power from the local [drug] market,\"" said Mej�a.\n\nThe number of Mexicans who reported having used drugs once in their lives nearly doubled between 2011 and 2016, from just over 5 percent to roughly 10 percent, according to a government survey. That explosion in drug use coincides with the highest homicide rates the country has seen in modern history, with an average of 90 murders every day.\n\nThe Mexican state is struggling to cope with the expansion in drug consumption and doesn't have the infrastructure to provide the care that people need, its officials concede. That's placing NGOs like Verter on the front lines of the battle to contain this growing epidemic.\n\nA two-hour drive west from Verter in Mexicali, the local needle-exchange program Prevencasa confronts the same reality in the border town of Tijuana. Some 18 months ago, they started to see a new trend: a spike in overdoses that coincided with the arrival of a white powder \""heroin\"" known as China White. But this isn't the infamous China White -- pure heroin from Southeast Asia -- of the 1980s. It's just another name for synthetic, black-market fentanyl, and Prevencasa has the tests to prove it.\n\n\""Today, they have taken the same label and applied it to fentanyl, since it is also white and most of it comes from China,\"" says Mike Vigil, who, as the former chief of international operations at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), spent nearly two decades working in Mexico.\n\n\""Fentanyl is now the majority of the 'heroin' consumed in Tijuana, based on what we're seeing in Prevencasa,\"" says Joseph Friedman, an MD/Ph.D. student from the University of California, Los Angeles, who is doing research with the outreach program on heroin use in Tijuana.\n\n\""It's faster-acting and has led to a big spike in overdoses, which are fatal if you don't treat them,\"" Friedman notes. \""There is a subjective difference that a lot of people report between what you experience with a black tar heroin as opposed to China White/fentanyl -- a stronger initial come-on that goes down faster and provokes other weird sensations. Something is different.\""\n\nThe United States is deporting some of its opioid crisis south of the border, says Friedman.\n\nFriedman notes, \""The U.S. opioid epidemic is a massive wave of suffering, and some percent of that wave is deportable -- and the deported fraction ends up here and then what happens to them? A big fraction of the population became addicted in California and then got deported.\""\n\nMeanwhile, to push meth -- known locally as cristal -- in the border cities, drug sellers have in recent years offered a bonus dose free with heroin, says 41-year-old Lourdes Angulo, who co-founded Verter in Mexicali. \""That was to get them hooked, and that's how the use of cristal started to increase here.\""\n\nThe scale of the crisis is visible to Dr. Clara Fleiz at Mexico's National Institute of Psychiatry, who has been working with organizations such as Prevencasa and Verter to study causes for the rise in overdoses. A survey conducted by her team in the border cities of Tijuana, Mexicali, San Luis R�o Colorado and Ciudad Ju�rez shows that overdoses from fentanyl are going \""higher and higher every day,\"" she says. \""Now, 25 percent [of drug users] have had one in the last year.\""\n\nThat's only going to get worse. As the U.S. doubles down on border security, getting drugs across the international line is getting harder and more complicated for criminal organizations. Seizures of fentanyl by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) more than doubled between 2017 and 2018, from 181 to 388 pounds. Meth seizures by the CBP increased from 4,000 pounds in 2014 to 13,400 pounds already this year. In turn, homegrown markets are becoming more of a focus for crime groups, and the protection of local street sales is emerging as a parallel reason for homicides in Mexico.\n\n\""Sadly, we are prey to what the United States does,\"" says Jaime Arredondo, who researches drug and security policy in both the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nIn the city of Irapuato, in the central state of Guanajuato, Luciano Salazar, 35, squints as he looks at his phone. He points to dozens of local users of the Grindr dating app who have put a diamond symbol in their profiles. \""That shows that they either want to buy or sell cristal,\"" he explains. One baggie of meth costs just 50 pesos ($2.50).\n\nSalazar is gay. He estimates that most of those he comes across in the gay community in the city of 600,000 people use cristal -- including in ChemSex parties popular in the male gay population. He himself was an addict for two years. \""I weighed 83 kilos when I started using cristal -- by the end of my addiction, I weighed 53,\"" he says.\n\nCristal is today the most popular drug in Guanajuato, says Raul Espinosa, who works at Irapuato Vive, a nonprofit that assists drug users. Demand for treatment for meth use has grown more than seven-fold in the state, from fewer than 200 in 2013 to nearly 1,400 people seeking help in government clinics in 2018, according to official figures. More than two-thirds of addicts at the state's treatment centers, known by their acronym CIJ in Spanish, are looking for treatment for meth use, and the CIJ is overwhelmed.\n\nIrapuato Vive lies along an industrial corridor that runs through the state and also includes the cities of Celaya, Silao, Salamanca and Leon. Observers say that the long shifts people need to work at car assembly lines and factories or while trucking long distances also encourage meth use -- it helps them keep feeling alert and keeps fatigue at bay. The car industry in Guanajuato -- including factories for General Motors, Pirelli, Volkswagen and Ford -- accounts for 18 percent of the state economy, according to Sophia Huett, Guanajuato's chief of public security. \""One 50-peso dose gets [truck drivers] through the night or all the way to Monterrey,\"" says Espinosa.\n\nThat pattern is also evident in Tijuana, which is littered with factories known as maquilas that produce everything from cars and electronic home appliances to laptops and mobile phones. \""I could concentrate more and think faster when I first started using cristal at work,\"" says German Navarro, 49, a recovering addict in Tijuana. When he was using meth a few years ago, he worked as a dispatcher in the border city, organizing drivers who would truck goods into the U.S. A strong stimulant, meth improved his performance on the job and allowed him to stay alert and awake for longer.\n\nBut the rise in meth use isn't isolated to a few cities. Multiple Mexican states have seen a sharp increase in its use. Demand in five states -- Guanajuato, Jalisco, Michoac�n, Sonora and Sinaloa -- more than doubled between 2008 and 2016, according to government figures. Colima saw an eight-fold increase in people reporting use over this period. And most experts interviewed by OZY think government surveys underestimate the scale of the problem.\n\nMeth addiction is more than just a medical issue. The rising levels of meth use also correlate with more homicides. The state of Guanajuato is home to the popular tourist destinations of San Miguel de Allende and the city of Guanajuato, and had never been a homicide hot spot before 2017. But for the past two years, it has witnessed the highest rate of killings in the country. There were 2,609 in 2018, according to the Public System for National Security, and the homicide rate was 57 per 100,000 compared to a national average of 29. This year is on track to be just as bad -- 1,790 murders in the first eight months.\n\n\""The murder rates that we're seeing are scandalous,\"" the state's prosecutor Carlos Zamarripa ENTITY tells OZY.\n\nGuanajuato isn't alone. Where meth use has grown most noticeably, homicides are at brutal levels. Colima's homicide rate currently stands at 103 per 100,000 -- in 2015, it was 19.2. In the southern state of Michoac�n, homicide rates have doubled in recent years, from just over 25 per 100,000 in 2015 to nearly 55 this year.\n\nOver the last decade, territorial disputes between cartels over routes into America were the motive for such killings.\n\n\""Slum and urban violence amongst youths tend to be related to retail sales, whereas violence out in the mountains are more high-level hits by the cartels, major confrontations between organizations and disputes over export routes,\"" says Jaime Lopez, a former Mexican law enforcement official who is now a security analyst.\n\nPhotos provided by Zamarripa's office show packets of meth and marijuana clearly marked with branding of the New Generation Jalisco Cartel (CJNG), one of the country's most notorious crime syndicates along with the Sinaloa cartel that Joaqu�n \""El Chapo\"" Guzm�n used to share control of. In August last year, the Mexican military recovered 50 tons of meth in a mountain lab in Sinaloa. Mexican authorities have also seized fentanyl in states such as Michoac�n, Jalisco and Sinaloa, and in the last 12 months have found four clandestine laboratories around the country.\n\nEspinosa and drug users at the Irapuato Vive center say that many homicides involve low-level dealers and addicts who are punished by their dealers for buying meth from rival suppliers.\n\n\""The biggest challenge to public security is drug consumption,\"" says Huett. But neither her state government nor the federal administration appears prepared to tackle the crisis.\n\nGady Zabicky knows that he has a problem on his hands. The new head of Mexico's addiction treatment agency -- known by its acronym CONADIC -- is worried not only by the growing use of meth and fentanyl, but also by the falling age of users and the growing number of women getting hooked, according to recent government surveys. \""This is a red flag,\"" says Zabicky.\n\nIn many ways, the arrival of fentanyl use in Mexico is of America's making and a consequence of the opioid crisis currently rocking the U.S., where for years unfettered pharmaceutical companies marketed highly addictive opioid painkillers to medical professionals and patients. Patients got addicted, and when their insurance or prescriptions ran out, they turned to street-market Mexican heroin to feed their habits. Some of that heroin contained fentanyl to make it stronger, although drug users weren't necessarily aware of that because these were illegal drugs.\n\nOnce addicts discovered they were taking fentanyl and that it was a stronger opioid than heroin, some of them left heroin behind altogether. The fentanyl industry that grew out of that demand -- the drug goes into the U.S. direct from China in the postal system as well as via the border produced by Mexican cartels -- has found a new market.\n\n\""Because of our insatiable demand for all kinds of drugs, other countries such as Mexico supply them,\"" says Vigil, the former DEA agent. \""And they also supply users in their own country. Source countries eventually create addiction, drug overdose deaths and devastated communities. Mexico is no exception.\""\n\nBut whatever the origins of the crisis, Zabicky admits that the current Mexican administration simply doesn't have the network to cope. There are state clinics across the country that mostly provide free treatment; 104 CIJ centers and another program known as CAPA, which has some 341 units around the country. They're not enough, and those drug users left out depend upon thousands of private drug treatment centers, the majority of which aren't regulated.\n\nA minority of them can provide the tools people need to get off drugs, but others known as annexos are notorious for imprisoning addicts and abusing their human rights with the aim of curing their habits -- which is illegal but tolerated. Zabicky says that there are some 2,200 around the country, but there are likely many more. In the city of Irapuato alone, users say there are more than 50 private clinics. \""The majority of them don't comply with government norms,\"" admits Zabicky, but the government can't close them down because there isn't enough state help to go around. \""The system would collapse.\""\n\nInstead, Zabicky plans to bring all the private drug clinics operating around Mexico onto the government's radar in order to better train their staff and establish basic norms. But his approach contrasts with that of the government he serves.\n\nAlthough observers welcome President AMLO's renewed focus on addiction, many worry about the tone and approach. The government's current anti-drug-use campaigns warn users that fentanyl kills -- even the first time it's used.\n\n\""I think these kinds of campaigns produce more fear instead of educating people about substance use, which generates negative consequences. These scare tactics don't contribute to a more elevated conversation about drug policy,\"" says Arredondo, the drugs policy researcher.\n\nAnd despite AMLO's publicized push against addiction, federal government money to private organizations such as Prevencasa and Verter in the border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali was cut off at the beginning of the year when he entered office. The cuts were part of the president's fight against corruption.\n\nFleiz at Mexico's National Institute of Psychiatry says that while it's important to filter out corrupt organizations, all groups shouldn't be painted with the same brush. \""I'm in complete disagreement with these budget cuts,\"" she says. \""The people that have been really hard hit are drug users, as there are less resources to help them.\""\n\nApart from its media campaign, part of the government's efforts to address addiction are legislative. A bill for decriminalizing marijuana use and cultivation is currently being debated in the country's senate. It's not clear if and when the bill will pass, and there are doubts as to how effective it could be.\n\nOn the border, activists are taking a more vanguard approach than AMLO. Nancy ENTITY, 43, visited the Verter center in Mexicali early on a recent Sunday afternoon to exchange her dirty needles for clean ones. She then went into the back room and tied a blue tourniquet around her tiny arm before shooting up heroin, as Angulo watched her. This tiny space is the first of its kind in the entire region -- embracing the principle of harm reduction for drug users, rather than criminalization.\n\nAngulo and her colleagues are trying to get vulnerable women like ENTITY to slowly embrace other services they offer such as HIV tests, counseling services and health education. \""We have had to adapt. Here, women can stay as long as they want or need -- and our adviser has to be with them here all the time,\"" says Angulo.\n\nSuch an approach could be a welcome change in Latin America, where laws and policies generally stigmatize users of hard drugs like ENTITY and Moreno. When the Verter safe room opened in September last year, it caused a scandal -- betraying the conservatism of large slices of Mexican society. A national newspaper called it a legal picadero -- slang for places where addicts consume drugs -- and an embarrassed local government shut it down. After a dogged bureaucratic effort by Angulo and her co-founder, the room is operating in a bureaucratic gray zone, registered as a business when it's a nonprofit. \""It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission,\"" says Angulo, shrugging. She doesn't know how much longer the room will remain open.\n\nFor users like Moreno, the government's focus on addiction is too little, too late, but it is early days for other users. In the United States, the government failed to realize what was happening until the situation was critical. Mexico's authorities won't be able to use that excuse if fentanyl addiction here reaches the same levels."

LOS REYES,0,"If you're an up and coming actor, do you want to land a part in a franchise like the Terminator movies? After all, those films have long been dominated by the presence of Arnold Schwarzenegger's title cyborg, and the last two or three entries in the saga have taken their fair share of knocks (and arguably then some).\n\nBut there is still something cool about getting involved in one of sci-fi cinema's most acclaimed and groundbreaking (both visually and thematically) franchises, which is how Mackenzie Davis (Blade Runner 2049), Gabriel Luna (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) and newcomer Natalia ENTITY came to star in Terminator: Dark Fate alongside series icons Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton -- the latter returning to the role of Sarah Connor for the first time in 28 years.\n\nread more: Terminator: Dark Fate review\n\nDavis plays Grace, a cybernetically enhanced super soldier from the future, who is sent back to the present to protect Dani (ENTITY), a young woman who holds the key to that future -- although not exactly as you might expect. \It was amazing when I finally got to read the script,\"" says ENTITY in our interview below. \""Because, you know, they don't really say much when you're auditioning. So when I actually read the script, I was just amazed by, you know, I thought it was a great story but also that my character, I was expecting it to be these Latino characters that we are all used to seeing.\""\n\nShe continues, \""It was one of the main characters. She was not related to drugs, prostitution, or nothing illegal, and it was like a big surprise. It was like, you know, this is great. I think this is a reflection of how the world has changed and Hollywood's changing, and we just want more and bigger representation.\""\n\nread more: What Brought Arnold and Linda Back to the Terminator Saga\n\nDavis agrees with ENTITY that until she read the full script, she had the impression that Grace was a much more straightforward and physical role. \""You go through this process and the last thing you do is read the script,\"" she explains. \""So initially it was Tim (Miller, director) and his enthusiasm and his vision for the movie and him showing me some of the (pre-visualization) realizations of the stunts and my character. It just felt really like, 'Okay, I can't believe you want me to play that.'\""\n\nBut like ENTITY, Davis found more than she expected in the script and character. \""You're just sort of hoping the script is good the whole time,\"" she adds. \""When I read the script, I was very pleasantly surprised and loved the dynamic between Linda and Natalia and my character. But yeah, I think because we didn't have that at first, it really was just this totally different, athletic role to play.\""\n\nFor Gabriel Luna, his role was even more mysterious and different -- that of the Rev-9, the newest killing machine from the future which has a liquid ectoskeleton and an armored endoskeleton, both of which can separate and fight at the same time. How did they explain all that to Luna?\n\n\""They didn't really,\"" replies the actor, who had to deal with extensive visual effects as Robbie ENTITY/Ghost Rider on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. \""The main thing early was they wanted him to be a charming guy. They wanted him to be a friendly face, one that could lure people close to him and then, you know, cut their head off. That was always there.\""\n\nread more: The Tragedy of RoboCop, Terminator and Other AIs\n\nLuna elaborates, \""I started to see some previz, some of the fights and I could see, oh, he has blades or he can form two blades in his hand and it's kind of wielding it almost like a double-sided sword. I was like, \""Oh, that's cool. But that's not really much of an advancement or a technological advancement from the previous (movies).' I was just curious what else was possible. Then, sure enough, I got the script the day before I left for Madrid and I read it. I read the scene where I'm driving the truck and then my endo is driving the truck and my exo goes out onto the hood. I was like, \""Okay, yeah. Now, that is really cool. Now, that's something that people will see and be like, 'Yeah, that's bad ass, dude.'\""\n\nAs the Rev-9 pursues Dani and Grace, the battle is joined early on by Sarah Connor, whom neither ENTITY nor Davis had met prior to their auditions for the movie. \""I met her here in LA,\"" says ENTITY. \""I came for a callback, so I was not expecting that Linda Hamilton was there, but she was there, and I was shocked. I couldn't believe Linda Hamilton was auditioning with me. She's so loving and generous, and she held my hand, and she was hugging me. You know, it was like this love at first sight.\""\n\n\""I met Linda first at a screen test that she flew to Ireland to do with me because I was stuck there shooting a movie and couldn't come back to LA,\"" says Davis. \""Which is such an indication of her character and generosity...I think it's so cool of her.

You've got it. You move your body very well,' he would say. He's a wonderful dude. He's one of my heroes. One of his superpowers is he makes us all feel like we're superheroes. You know what I mean? That's the tale of a great leader and a winner, is he wants to instill his great qualities in those around him, so that we can be better and that we can be elevated and equipped to do the task.\""\n\nBut the most important question is, does Arnold stay in character when the cameras are not rolling or does the T-800 stand down?\n\n\""He's funny,\"" say both ENTITY and Davis, with the latter adding, \""He just wants to tease and joke and have a good time. I feel like he's sorted his life out in a really nice way. He has a group of friends that come with him wherever he works, and they explore new cities. It feels like if you're going to work as much as he has over the course of his life, do it with this group of people that you love and make it fun.\""\n\nLuna says he tried to spend as much time with his co-star as possible. \""I usually always eat lunch with the crew. I always do,\"" he says. \""But in this instance, he always had these really great chess games, chess matches, challenges going on. I was like, 'Man, well, I got to go play some chess with Arnold.'

LOS REYES,0,"Warning: This post contains major spoilers for Terminator: Dark Fate.\n\nIt has been 18 years since Sarah and John Connor prevented Judgment Day, but unlike a certain Jaeger commander, they were never truly able to cancel the apocalypse. The Terminator franchise has attempted three sequels/resets since the release of James Cameron's 1991 action classic -- four if you count the best of the bunch, the underrated TV series The Sarah Connor Chronicles -- only to see each of the post-T2 projects fail to scale the creative and commercial heights of the first two Terminator films.\n\nNow here comes Terminator: Dark Fate, the sixth movie Terminator overall and the first installment that can boast to having Cameron's semi-direct involvement since T2. The Avatar mastermind executive produced the Tim Miller-directed movie, which reunites Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger, while also wiping the slate clean of every other post-Judgment Day story. Rise of the Machines? Terminated. Salvation? Terminated. Genisys? Terminated... with extreme prejudice.\n\nInstead, Dark Fate picks up in 2020, and finds Hamilton's veteran warrior Sarah Connor teaming up with cybernetically enhanced time traveler Grace (Mackenzie Davis) for a mission to protect a young Mexican woman, Daniella (Natalia ENTITY), from assassination by a new, improved Terminator, the shape-shifting Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna). The choice to essentially start over from scratch simplifies franchise's head-scratching continuity, and makes it more complicated at the same time. With that in mind, here's our answers to all the burning questions you'll have before and after seeing Dark Fate.\n\nI haven't seen John Connor in any of the trailers -- does he appear in the movie?\n\nAlong with Cameron, Hamilton hasn't had anything to do with the Terminator franchise since 1991, so the feature film sequels have sought to move the story forward with John rather than his mother. (Genisys is the exception, but even though she gave it the old college try, Emilia Clarke couldn't replace Hamilton.) Dark Fate has been trumpeting the return of the O.G. Sarah Connor since production started, but John's presence has largely gone unaddressed, although Cameron did tell San Diego Comic-Con audiences that Judgment Day star Edward Furlong would be reprising the role he originated, and which was later inherited by Nick Stahl, Christian Bale and Jason Clarke.\n\nCameron told the truth... kind of. Thanks to the magic of CGI, Furlong's youthful face appears in Dark Fate's prologue, which is set in 1998, one year after the Judgment Day that never was. He and Sarah -- who has also been digitally de-aged back to her '90s appearance -- are enjoying a beachside vacation, when a stray T-800 (played by the \young\"" Schwarzenegger) arrives and accomplishes what his predecessors failed to do: terminate John Connor. Its mission complete, the killer robot walks away, leaving Sarah crying over the body of her dead son and the one-time savior of the future.\n\nSo wait: if John's dead now, doesn't that mean Skynet wins?\n\nNo, this is a case of too little, too late. As Sarah explains/retcons, Skynet sent another T-800 back to the past, but by the time it caught up with them, she and John had successfully changed the future by blowing up Cyberdyne and watching the T-1000 and the \""good\"" T-800 drown in molten steel. So even as John's eventual executioner was still following his Skynet-installed code, Skynet as an entity had ceased to be when he pulled the trigger.\n\nHumanity being humanity, though, we can't help but become the eventual architects of our own destruction. While John and Sarah stopped Skynet, in the distant future that Grace hails from -- 2042 to be exact -- Judgment Day was caused by an A.I. called Legion. Created to fight on the side of mankind in cyberwars, Legion inevitably rebelled and blew the world to smithereens, before creating its own army of robot soldiers to wipe out any straggling survivors. \""Those a******s never learn,\"" Sarah sighs when she learns that another group of morons destroyed the planet with the same technology they assumed would save it. Preach, Ms. Connor!\n\nWho's gonna step up and save us now?\n\nSince future-history is repeating itself, Sarah assumes that Grace has been sent back in time to protect Daniella as she's going to give birth to the one person that can defeat Legion. But it turns out that Dani isn't the next Sarah Connor -- she's the next John Connor. Grace was still a young girl when Legion initiated Judgment Day, and she remembers feeling weak and helpless in the immediate aftermath of the nuclear apocalypse. That is, until she crossed paths with Dani, who became her adopted mother and trained her to fight Terminators instead of running from them. Severely wounded following one firefight, Grace voluntarily underwent cybernetic-enhancement and then also volunteered to make a one-way trip to the past to spoil Legion's assassination plot.\n\nAnd in case you're wondering, yes, Dark Fate is keenly aware of the larger sociopolitical statement its making by revealing that humanity's future rests on the fate of a woman from Mexico City. Midway though the film, Sarah, Grace and Dani have to make an illegal crossing into the U.S. and run into Border Patrol agents, who proceed to lock them up in cages along with other immigrants. Those agents are then the first casualties when the Rev-9 shows up and re-enacts the police station sequence from the original Terminator. \""It would feel disingenuous if you were going to do a movie that crossed the Mexican-American border with a Mexican national and didn't [do that] in some way,\"" Miller told Inverse recently. \""When I first walked into that set and you see the extras in the cages, it was a very emotional moment for me. I got on the microphone and apologized to everyone. It was such a really s****y chapter in world history. I felt terrible about. But it has a drama that I felt was appropriate for the story.\""\n\nHow does Ah-nuld factor into all this?\n\nYou've heard of The Last of the Mohicans? Well, an alternate title for Dark Fate could be The Last of the T-800s. Erasing Skynet from the timeline also implies that the T-800 line as we knew it was never created, making John's executioner the final model from a never-opened factory. In the ensuing decades, Sarah has disposed of other time-traveling assassins courtesy of a mysterious benefactor who regularly texts her with details, signing off each message with the words: \""For John.\"" The boy's actual killer, though, has remained elusive... until now. Thanks to Grace's efforts, they've been able to trace those messages back to their source -- a small cabin in rural Texas. After escaping the detention center and the Rev-9, the trio make its way to that location, knock on the door and the T-800 opens it.\n\nHe doesn't introduce himself as \""the T-800,\"" of course. He's acquired another name since Sarah saw him last: Carl. Not only that, but he also has a whole life that includes a job (professional drapery installer), a family (a wife and an adopted son), and a new moral code. Bereft of purpose or direction after killing John, Carl had plenty of time to study humanity and found himself caring for the people he was created to kill. It was that new directive that motivated him to become Sarah's \""For John\"" texter. And now that they're on his doorstep, he's ready to be called back into action for the last time. \""I won't be back,\"" he tells his family and, by extension, the audience. (More on that in a minute.)\n\nThe Terminator got married? And his wife seriously didn't realize she was married to a robot for 20 years?\n\nCarl claims that across those two decades of wedded bliss, his wife didn't expect or want a physical relationship with him. We'll just leave that subject there.\n\nWho makes it out of Dark Fate alive?\n\nNot Carl! Despite being outmatched by the more nimble Rev-9, the sturdy T-800 keeps on ticking and punching through an aerial battle followed by an exhausting brawl at the Hoover Dam. Terminating the Legion-made robot for good requires a double sacrifice. Having determined that an EMP-level attack is the only way to stop the Rev-9 -- and having lost their own EMP -- Grace reaches into her chest and pulls out the battery that keeps her cyborg parts pumping. Dani takes her future daughter's \""heart\"" and plunges it into the Rev-9's chest, just as Carl grabs him and both Terminators take a fatal plunge. Grace dies moments later, secure in the knowledge that the future will still have Dani in it.\n\nThe last scene of the movie takes place sometime later, with Sarah and Dani watching Grace's childhood self running around a playground -- one that looks strikingly similar to the one where Sarah watched Los Angeles burn in her Judgment Day nightmare. Before driving off together, Dani pledges to find a way for Grace to avoid taking her fatal trip through time. Good thing she has an experienced future fighter to help with that.\n\nIs there a post-credits scene?\n\nNope -- feel free to bail once the credits roll.\n\nWill there be a sequel?\n\nWhile the Rev-9 is so much scrap metal, Legion hasn't gone down in defeat like Skynet. That leaves the door open for the dynamic duo of Sarah and Dani to locate the A.I.'s inventors and shut the program down, all while battling yet another robot from the future. Whether we'll see any more of this revised timeline depends largely on Dark Fate's box-office fate. But even if it's a domestic and/or international hit, there's a chance the rights to the franchise could be up for grabs again in 2020. In other words, if Sarah and Dani fail to terminate Legion, copyright law could.\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate is playing in theaters now\n\nLinda Hamilton delivers a classic 'Terminator' line in new 'Dark Fate' trailer\n\nGovernator gone wild: Schwarzenegger cracks jokes about sex, Trump at 'Terminator' Comic-Con panel\n\nJames Cameron reveals dark title for new 'Terminator' movie, teases a 'hardened' Sarah Connor"
LOS REYES,0,"THE BIG IDEA: President Trump tweeted this morning that \just a casual reading of the Transcript leads EVERYBODY to see that the call with the Ukrainian President was a totally appropriate one.\"" He's referring to the rough transcript of his July 25 phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky, which showed that Trump asked for a \""favor\"" from his counterpart in Kyiv. To see how \""perfectly appropriate\"" he behaved, the president tweeted yesterday, \""all anyone has to do is READ THE TRANSCRIPT!\"" On Oct. 2, Trump claimed that the document is \""an exact word-for-word transcript of the conversation.\""\n\nBut we're learning new details that suggest what the White House put out was rougher than previously acknowledged. During more than 10 hours of testimony on Tuesday, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman - the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council and the first witness in the House impeachment inquiry who actually heard the call - said that the rough transcript released by the White House does not include everything that transpired.\n\nThe Army officer, who earned the Purple Heart for valor during combat in Iraq, recalled Zelensky specifically referencing the Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma by name when Trump pushed him to investigate a company related to Joe Biden's son Hunter. Vindman also remembered Trump talking about how the former vice president was on tape boasting about Ukraine funds. This is most likely a reference to comments Biden made last year that the United States iced $1 billion in loan guarantees until the Ukrainian government fired a corrupt former prosecutor, per Karoun Demirjian and Greg Jaffe.\n\nEven if the filled-in gaps don't materially change our previous understanding of what took place, the revelation highlights just how much the public still does not know. As the investigation proceeds at what seems like a rapid pace, it's also an important reminder that official White House pronouncements should not be taken at face value.\n\n-- Vindman not only testified that the rough transcript omitted \""crucial words and phrases,\"" according to the New York Times, but he also said that his efforts to update the record of the call to reflect Trump's mentions of Burisma and Biden on tape failed: \""Colonel Vindman did not testify to a motive behind the White House editing process ... but the decision by a White House lawyer to quickly lock down the reconstructed transcript subverted the normal process of handling such documents ...The note-takers and voice recognition software used during the July 25 call had missed Mr. Zelensky saying the word 'Burisma,' according to people briefed on the matter, but the reconstructed transcript does refer to 'the company,' and suggests that the Ukrainian president is aware that it is of great interest to Mr. Trump. ...\n\n\""After the call, Colonel Vindman was given a hard copy of the rough transcript to make updates and corrections ... Colonel Vindman went through the transcript, made changes and gave his written edits to his boss ... After the call, Colonel Vindman went with his brother, a lawyer on the National Security Council staff, to see John A. Eisenberg, the council's legal adviser, to raise his concerns about the conversation. Colonel Vindman declined to detail to investigators his discussions with Mr. Eisenberg, citing attorney-client privilege...\n\n\""One explanation for why Colonel Vindman's changes were not made could be that the transcript had been quickly placed into a highly secure computer system, the N.S.C. Intelligence Collaboration Environment, or NICE system, making it more difficult to alter. Mr. Eisenberg ordered the transcript moved to ensure that people who were not assigned to handle Ukraine policy could not read the transcript, a decision he hoped would prevent gossip and leaks about the call. Putting the transcript in the secure server would have made it more difficult to make further edits to the document, and in the case of the July call effectively stopped additional changes. Mr. Eisenberg made the decision without consulting with his supervisor, Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel. A White House review of the handling of the call is examining if Mr. Eisenberg acted properly in securing the notes.\""\n\n-- \""One of the Times' examples of how Vindman wanted to adjust the transcript contradicts what the White House said about the transcript when it was released,\"" CNN notes. \""Asked in September why there were three ellipses, a senior White House official said they 'do not indicate missing words or phrases' but 'refer to a trailing off of a voice or pause. If there were missing words or phrases, they would be represented by brackets or redactions. This is the standard practice that is followed for all records of Presidential phone calls.' However, the Times reports that one of the changes to the transcript sought by Vindman was regarding replacing an ellipses: 'The rough transcript also contains ellipses at three points where Mr. Trump is speaking. Colonel Vindman told investigators that at the point of the transcript where the third set of ellipses appears, Mr. Trump said there were tapes of Mr. Biden.'\""\n\nNBC, the AP and BuzzFeed reported that they confirmed various elements of the Times reporting, including that Vindman tried to change the transcript to no avail.\n\n-- Flashback: The initial transcripts that Richard Nixon released of his conversations in the Oval Office were also incomplete. They didn't include the most incriminating material because the then-president edited it out.\n\n-- Vindman's testimony draws fresh attention to the White House's failure to release any rough transcript of Vice President Pence's conversation with Zelensky.\n\n-- Sketchy backchanneling surrounding U.S. policy toward Ukraine long predates this summer. That's a big takeaway from the prepared remarks of two career diplomats who are testifying on the Hill today.\n\nChristopher Anderson, a career Foreign Service officer, will detail efforts when U.S. officials tried to demonstrate support for Ukraine only to be batted down by the White House, including after Russian forces attacked and seized Ukrainian military vessels in the Sea of Azov in 2018. \""While my colleagues at the State Department quickly prepared a statement condemning Russia for its escalation, senior officials in the White House blocked it from being issued,\"" Anderson planned to say.\n\nCatherine Croft, who worked on Ukraine issues at the White House and the State Department, will disclose that she received inexplicable phone calls from Washington lobbyist Robert Livingston, \""who told me that Ambassador Yovanovitch should be fired,\"" referring to Marie Yovanovitch, then the top U.S. envoy in Kyiv. \""He characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an 'Obama holdover' and associated with George Soros,\"" she planned to say. Yovanovitch was recalled from her position at Trump's direction earlier this year after the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his associates made unsubstantiated allegations that she was opposed to Trump. \""It was not clear to me at the time -- or now -- at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch,\"" Croft planned to say.\n\n\""Croft is expected to say she notified her boss, Fiona Hill, and another State Department official, George Kent, of Livingston's activities, and declare that she is 'not aware of any action that was taken in response,'\"" John Hudson and Elise Viebeck report. \""Livingston, a former Republican congressman from Louisiana, was chosen as the successor to Newt Gingrich as speaker of the House in 1999, but he declined the position after revelations of an extramarital affair. After leaving Congress, he formed the Livingston Group, one of Washington's most influential lobbying firms. His firm has represented clients in the Middle East and around the world, including political figures in Ukraine such as former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, according to Justice Department documents.\""\n\n-- Read Croft's opening statement here and Anderson's here.\n\n-- It's also important to emphasize that Vindman's concerns were broader than the July 25 call. Greg Miller looks into two White House meetings on July 10 with Ukrainian officials that have become central to the impeachment inquiry: \""One of the officials Trump had entrusted to pursue this agenda, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, was undeterred by the fierce opposition from [John] Bolton and others. He persisted in pressing Ukraine to commit to Trump's demands, convening a second meeting even after a spectacular blowup in the West Wing. ... After seeing Sondland outline political demands that Trump would reiterate in his July 25 call, Vindman said, he became worried that what he had witnessed was improper ...\n\n\""Sondland has testified that he didn't know of any Biden connection in Trump's demands for a Burisma investigation until much later, after the allegations in the whistleblower complaint became known. He has also said that no White House officials ever expressed any concern to him about his efforts to push Ukraine to commit to the Burisma probe. His lawyer declined to comment Tuesday after the release of Vindman's opening statement. Sondland's account is contradicted by statements from Hill and Vindman. Hill testified that she entered the Ward Room as the follow-up meeting was already underway and heard Sondland say the word 'Burisma' as he resumed pressing the Ukrainians to pursue certain investigations. She then ordered that meeting to an immediate close.\n\n\""Vindman said that Sondland used the downstairs meeting to press for 'investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma.' Vindman said he then confronted Sondland, saying that 'his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the [National Security Council] was going to get involved in or push.'\"" (The Fix created a Trump-Ukraine timeline to help keep straight what we've learned.)\n\n-- \""It's become a case of he said, they said\"" is how the Wall Street Journal puts it: Vindman and Hill, in addition to acting ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, have all contradicted to varying degrees what Sondland told investigators.\n\nWHIPPING TOMORROW'S VOTE:\n\n-- House Democrats unveiled the new procedures for the impeachment inquiry that they plan to vote on Thursday. Mike DeBonis reports: \""The resolution backed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) hands the lead role to the House Intelligence Committee and its chairman, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who would have broad latitude to organize extended questioning of potential public witnesses. Two other committees that have so far participated in the closed-door investigation into Trump's dealings with Ukraine -- Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform -- would not be permitted to directly participate in the open proceedings under the legislation. It also sets out for the first time the ability of House Republicans to make their own requests for testimony and documents, though those requests will be subject to a vote of the Democratic-majority committee -- a practice that matches the minority powers in the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.\n\n\""The House Rules Committee will debate and potentially amend the measure at a panel meeting Wednesday afternoon. ... By confining the public hearings to the Intelligence Committee and excluding the other two panels that have participated in the closed-door interviews, Democrats are in effect sidelining several of the GOP's most aggressive and outspoken defenders of Trump. They include Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio) and Mark Meadows (N.C.), who serve on the Oversight panel, as well as Rep. Lee Zeldin (N.Y.) of the Foreign Affairs Committee, who have led the public pushback to the Democratic impeachment effort in the House.\"" (Read the draft of the resolution and the House Judiciary Committee's draft procedures.)\n\n-- Pelosi expects all but a handful of her Democratic members to support the resolution. One holdout is Rep. Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.). \""What's going to happen in my mind, it's going to happen here in the House; it will go over to the Senate, and then he will believe that he has been exonerated,\"" Van Drew told reporters. \""He will still be the president, and he will still be the candidate -- a candidate who has been exonerated by the Senate.\""\n\n-- The latest on timing: House Democrats increasingly expect their effort to stretch well past Thanksgiving, possibly forcing a Senate trial into January or later. Michael Scherer and DeBonis report: \""House leaders had initially hoped to hold a floor vote before the Nov. 28 holiday so the Senate could hold trial before Christmas. But the surprising number of witnesses agreeing to testify behind closed doors ... over the past few weeks has extended the timeline and sparked a debate over whether prolonged impeachment proceedings are politically prudent. ... A January trial would also disrupt the final weeks of campaigning before the Iowa caucuses for candidates who are senators in Washington. ... The caucuses are Feb. 3.\""\n\n-- The timing depends, in part, on how quickly the courts move: The Justice Department got a reprieve yesterday afternoon when a federal appeals court said the Trump administration does not have to immediately release to the House Judiciary Committee certain grand jury materials from Bob Mueller's investigation. \""The court order means the issue will not be resolved before Nov. 5, when the final filing from the parties is due,\"" Ann Marimow reports. \""The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was responding to an emergency request from the Justice Department, which said in a court filing that it would be 'irreparably harmed' without a stay and that 'once the information is disclosed, it cannot be recalled and the confidentiality of the grand jury information will be lost for all time.' A three-judge panel paused the order pending further review but made clear it was not deciding the merits of the case.\"" (Read the court's order.)\n\n-- An Islamic State defector inside Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's hideout was critical to the success of the raid against the ISIS leader, U.S. officials said. Joby Warrick, Ellen Nakashima and Dan Lamothe report: \""The mole's detailed knowledge of Baghdadi's whereabouts as well as the room-by-room layout of his sanctuary proved to be critical in the Oct. 26 raid that ended with the death of the world's most-wanted terrorist, the officials said. The informant was present during the assault on Baghdadi's compound in the Syrian province of Idlib, and he was exfiltrated from the region two days later with his family. The man, whose nationality had not been revealed, is expected to receive some or all of the $25 million U.S. bounty that had been placed on Baghdadi's head, according to the officials. One official said he was a Sunni Arab who turned against the Islamic State because one of his relatives had been killed by the group. The Islamic State defector had been cultivated as an asset by the Syrian Democratic Forces.\""\n\n-- Out of the loop: \""Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney first learned about the U.S. military raid against ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after the operation was already underway,\"" NBC News reports. \""The extraordinary move by Trump to leave his chief of staff out of the most significant U.S. military operation against the world's most wanted terrorist since the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011 represents a major blow to Mulvaney, suggesting that he is increasingly sidelined inside the White House. The White House chief of staff typically would be central to such a momentous gambit for a president, coordinating logistics, public statements and notifications of congressional leaders and allies. Bill Daley, who was White House chief of staff during the bin Laden raid, was seated next to then-President Barack Obama as he monitored the raid ... Andrew Card, former President George W. Bush's longtime chief of staff, said the exclusion of Mulvaney from a moment of such magnitude in the presidency is difficult to grasp ... 'I'm baffled by it,' Card said. 'It's hard for me to imagine.'\""\n\n-- Dread descended upon Syria during the final hours of the cease-fire as American troops withdrew. Louisa Loveluck reports: \""In towns and cities, families debated, and sometimes fought, over whether, and where, to run. Selling their houses to pay for the help of unpredictable smugglers was one option. Moving closer to the Iraqi border, where thousands of refugees had already crossed, and then praying the violence wouldn't follow, was another. ... While U.S. troops withdrew to the south and out of the area where they'd long kept the peace, Russian military police moved in. Under an agreement reached last week between Russian President Vladi�mir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Russian forces would now patrol the border. At times, American and Russian armored vehicles passed on the road, each with their own red, white and blue flags flapping in the wind.\""\n\n-- Prime Minister Boris Johnson finally won support from lawmakers for an early election, setting up a December vote that will be dominated by Brexit. Karla Adam and William Booth report: \""Parliament will dissolve next week, and the parties will go into overdrive on their five-week campaigns. This will be the United Kingdom's first election in dark and dreary December since 1923 -- a time of year when Britons prefer Christmas parties to political party hustings. Voters will be offered some stark choices on Brexit, alongside the usual overenthusiastic promises, scary scenarios, misrepresentations and foggy numbers. Will the British double down on wanting to leave the European Union? Or will they change their minds and decide to stay in the largest trading club on the planet?\""\n\n-- The House voted overwhelmingly to recognize the \""genocide\"" of Armenians by the Ottoman Turks, a damning rebuke of Turkey in the wake of its invasion of Syria. From the AP: \""Historians estimate that up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed around World War I, and many scholars see it as the 20th century's first genocide. Turkey disputes the description, saying the toll has been inflated and considering those killed victims of a civil war. The nonbinding resolution passed 405-11 Tuesday. American lawmakers have been critical of Ankara's recent incursion against the Kurds along the Turkish-Syrian border.\""\n\n-- Chilling: The messaging service WhatsApp filed suit in federal court against the Israeli surveillance company NSO, claiming it acted illegally in helping governments hack into the mobile devices of more than 100 people worldwide, including journalists, human rights workers and women who had been the subject of online attacks. Targets, who also included religious figures and lawyers, were identified in 20 countries, according to the lawsuit. Craig Timberg and Jay Greene have more details: \""The suit amounted to a new legal front in attempts to curb the abuses of the burgeoning but almost entirely unregulated global surveillance industry. Victims of hacking previously have sued NSO in Israeli courts, but a technology company has not before pursued such legal action for using its services to help conduct spying operations on users.\n\n\""WhatsApp alleged that NSO helped government agencies deliver malicious software through seemingly harmless WhatsApp video calls, even if the targets never answered their phones. The malware was capable of initiating a powerful form of spying that included the ability to intercept communications, steal photos and other forms of data, activate microphones and cameras, track the locations of targets and more ... An NSO surveillance tool called Pegasus has been implicated in spying on Washington Post contributing writer Jamal Khashoggi before he was killed by people affiliated with Saudi Arabia's security services last year. A friend of Khashoggi, Omar Abdulaziz, has alleged in a lawsuit that his phone was infected with Pegasus without his knowledge and that the malicious software helped the Saudis snoop on Khashoggi.\""\n\nWhatsApp says in a blog post that the company, which is owned by Facebook, believes NSO violated U.S. and California law, as well as the terms of service for WhatsApp. \""At WhatsApp, we believe people have a fundamental right to privacy and that no one else should have access to your private conversations, not even us,\"" writes Will Cathcart, head of WhatsApp, in an op-ed for The Post. NSO rejected the allegations in the lawsuit, saying its technology is used by governments and law enforcement to fight terrorism. \""In the strongest possible terms, we dispute today's allegations and will vigorously fight them,\"" the Israeli company said in a statement forwarded by a Washington public relations agency.\n\n-- Scientists tripled their estimates of the number of people threatened by rising seas. Chris Mooney reports: \""The upshot of the study is that 110 million people worldwide live below the high-tide level -- including many partly protected by sea walls or other infrastructure, as in New Orleans. Even under a scenario of very modest climate change, that number will rise to 150 million in 2050 and 190 million by 2100. If climate change and sea level rise follow a worse path, as many as 340 million people living below the high-tide level could be in peril, to say nothing of how many could be affected by floods and extreme events.\""\n\n-- Climate activist Greta Thunberg declined the 2019 Nordic Council Environment Prize, saying the world needs more action on climate change and fewer awards. (CNN)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Pay-to-play politics: \""Payday lenders discussed raising money for Trump's campaign to fend off regulation,\"" by Renae Merle: \""Billing himself as one of President Trump's top fundraisers, Michael Hodges told fellow payday lenders recently that industry contributions to the president's reelection campaign could be leveraged to gain access to the Trump administration. 'Every dollar amount, no matter how small or large' ... is important, Hodges, founder of Advance Financial, one of the country's largest payday lenders, said during a 48-minute webcast ... 'For example, I've gone to Ronna McDaniel and said, \""Ronna, I need help on something,\"" ' Hodges said, referring to the chair of the Republican National Committee. 'She's been able to call over to the White House and say, \""Hey, we have one of our large givers. They need an audience. ... They need to be heard and you need to listen to them.\"" So that's why it's important.' ...\n\n\""The payday lending industry, made up of businesses that make short-term loans to consumers at high interest rates, is awaiting new rules that could weaken Obama administration requirements. ... Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) would pose a big threat if elected president, Hodges and three other industry insiders said during the talk. They called Trump their 'ultimate backstop' against attempts to defeat legislation the industry wants. ...Hodges said on the webinar that he has made [about $1.25 million] in campaign contributions to help Trump since 2016. ... 'That is important to the campaign, which means it's important to the president, which means it's important if you ever had to call on anyone for anything in the administration,' he said during the call. 'That's how those things work.'\n\n\""The White House declined to comment for this report. Trump's reelection committee did not return a call for comment. In a statement, Mike Reed, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said: 'Part of the RNC's job is sharing what we hear from supporters across the country with party leaders. We often will connect our supporters with other Republican officials when they have a message they would like to pass along.'\"" Note that this is not a denial.\n\n-- Rep. Bradley Byrne (R), a leading candidate for Senate in Alabama, warned Jeff Sessions that he will not back out of the race if the former attorney general tries to reclaim his old seat. Seung Min Kim reports: \""Both Byrne and Sessions draw their main base of political support from the Mobile area, triggering some speculation among insiders in the state that Byrne would bow out of the Senate race and run again for his old House seat if Sessions wages a bid. But Byrne said in an interview Tuesday that Sessions's entry would not make 'any difference to me' and vowed to stay in the race regardless. Then, unprompted, Byrne referenced what would almost certainly be Sessions's biggest political liability should he run again for the Senate. 'The president is very angry with Jeff. I think the president will be very vocal against him,' Byrne said. 'For Jeff's sake, I don't want that. But I think that's the reality of what he's facing.'\""\n\n-- George Papadopoulos, the former Trump foreign policy adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents, plans to run for the House seat being vacated by Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.). Allyson Chiu reports: \""Papadopoulos, 32, filed paperwork to run as a Republican in California's 25th District and is expected to formally announce his candidacy later this week, Fox News reported. The news was met with swift backlash from California State Assemblywoman Christy Smith, who is so far the lone Democrat in the race for Hill's seat. Three Republicans are also running, the Associated Press reported.\""\n\n-- Bernie Sanders and Warren are in a close race among likely voters in New Hampshire's Democratic primary, according to a new CNN poll. Sanders pulls 21 percent, while Warren follows him at 18 percent, which is within the margin of error. Biden stands slightly behind at 15 percent, while Pete Buttigieg is the final candidate to reach double digits with 10 percent. Three candidates landed 5 percent in the poll - Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Andrew Yang. Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), who polled at 9 percent in a July New Hampshire poll, received just 3 percent support now. The poll shows that the race remains very fluid, and many people have not made up their minds.\n\n-- Biden's cash-strapped campaign is talking to top donors about ways to beef up fundraising in the next quarter. Ideas include spending more on social media platforms. From CNBC: \""People familiar with the campaign's deliberations say boosting online efforts doesn't necessarily represent a major shift in strategy. Yet several of Biden's fundraisers believe that the campaign needs to improve its appeal to online donors. ... Biden's campaign has been behind in spending on Facebook ads that often entice contributors. Since he entered the race in April, Biden has spent $2.5 million on Facebook. Warren's campaign has spent $2.7 million and Sanders has bought $3.1 million in ads.\""\n\n-- Biden's campaign warned a newly formed super PAC not to attack the former vice president's Democratic competitors. \""Our campaign would be extremely frustrated if the super PAC was used to attack other Democrats,\"" Biden's campaign manager Greg Schultz told reporters Tuesday, per CBS News.\n\n-- Sanders has gained key endorsements from some of the country's most powerful Latinas, leading some to believe that he might have a shot in capturing the Latinx vote, which has huge sway potential but low turnout numbers. From Politico: \""Sanders' star support from prominent Latinas 'gives him barrio cred, street cred for this old white Jewish dude who is running for president,' said Domingo Garcia, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens. Garcia backed the Vermont senator in 2016 but, as president of LULAC, has refrained from endorsing a candidate in the current primary. ... There's also the reality that Sanders probably can't win the Democratic nomination without Latinos, since his campaign is relying on a strong finish in states such as Nevada and California. Speaking to a crowd of hundreds of Latinos at a LULAC town hall in Iowa last week, Sanders received the loudest welcome of any presidential candidate in attendance, rousing the audience as he took the stage.\""\n\n-- Former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker (R) mocked Sanders and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib for speaking to reporters in front of empty shelves during a campaign stop. Walker said the backdrop looked like the \""empty shelves of grocery stores in many socialist countries.\"" In reality, they were empty shelves at a Detroit food pantry for low-income families. From the Guardian: \""The Rev Roslyn Bouier, the executive director of the Brightmoor Pantry, pointed out that the shelves were empty because of the overwhelming demand there is for food and water in Detroit. The pantry sees around 1,700 families a month. 'The pantry shelves are so empty because we are doing our job. Because people need the food. That shows the inhumanity. America needs to do better. That's the sadness of it.'\""\n\n-- The Bennet brothers - Michael, a senator running for president, and James, the editorial page editor at the New York Times - are struggling to figure out their place in an altered political landscape. Ben Terris profiles the duo: \""The Bennets are the anti-Trump dynasty, institutionalists at a time when their very institutions -- Capitol Hill, the mainstream media -- have come under attack. To their critics on the left, they are mealy-mouthed centrists, focused on giving a platform to 'both sides,' for whom 'civility' is just another cudgel used by elites to cling to power. To their friends and supporters, they are what a politician and a newspaperman are supposed to look and act like, brothers in the mold of the Kennedys, idealists fighting for what's right. 'Are they dinosaurs or are they the future?' their lifelong friend Eric Kolodner said. 'I'm worried that it's the former.'\""\n\nIMPORTANT DOMESTIC STORIES THAT SHOULD BE ON YOUR RADAR:\n\n-- The U.S. economy cooled over the summer, growing at a 1.9 percent annualized pace from July through September, the latest sign that the slowdown is deepening. Heather Long and Andrew Van Dam report: \""The data, released Wednesday morning by the Commerce Department, came as economists anticipated slightly weaker growth following Trump's decision to dramatically expand his trade war with China in early August. ... Consumer spending continues to power the economy, but business investment has now contracted for six straight months, falling 3 percent in the third quarter, the biggest drop since the end of 2015. ... Spending on both structures and equipment was deeply negative. ... Slow growth abroad and problems at big employers such as Boeing and General Motors also were a drag on growth. ... The Fed is widely expected to make a modest cut to interest rates at 2pm on Wednesday.\""\n\n-- A federal judge issued an injunction to block Alabama's near-total abortion ban from going into effect. Ariana Eunjung Cha and Emily Wax-Thibodeaux report: \""The Alabama bill was tumultuous from the start, with an argument breaking out during one of its introductions. ... Both sides reacted with similar passion on Tuesday to U.S. District Court in Middle Alabama Judge Myron H. Thompson's decision to issue an injunction against the law going into effect. ... Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said in a statement that she signed it into law 'as a testament to Alabamians' long-standing belief that every human life is sacred' and said she is trusting the attorney general to do 'everything he can to challenge today's ruling and obtain a just result.' Amanda ENTITY, executive director at Yellowhammer Fund, a grass-roots organization that helps low-income women pay for abortions, said that while she is relieved to learn that abortion will remain legal in Alabama, 'this changes nothing when it comes to the crisis marginalized communities have faced and will continue to face when it comes to accessing a termination.'\""\n\n-- The White House thinks it found a loophole that could allow Trump to ignore the clear intent of federal law so that he can choose someone to lead the Department of Homeland Security who could not get confirmed by the Senate. From the Times: \""After Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary ... announced this month that he would resign, it was widely believed in the administration that Mr. Trump would tap someone who would not question his more extreme policies. ... But officials leading agencies in homeland security who echo Mr. Trump's fiery language on immigration ""ere initi"""

LOS REYES,0,"Joshua Ryan Joles, the CEO of LLC Wholesale Supply, LLC, Mohammad Mehdi Salemi, the CEO of Wholesalers Group, Inc. and Wholesalers Group, LLC, and bank account holders Angel Caminero Alvarez and Leonides Herrera were indicted on charges of money laundering, committing violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and mail fraud, related to their alleged participation in a scheme to sell diverted pharmaceuticals to unwitting pharmacies and consumers.\n\nU.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan for the Southern District of Florida stated, \The allegations set forth in this scheme strike at the peace of mind we should all feel when we buy prescription drugs from a pharmacy. We all expect and should rest assured knowing that the drugs we are buying are safe, effective, and properly stored and handled. Today and whenever necessary, we will continue to strike back at those who seek to profit by robbing the public of that peace of mind through brazen, criminal schemes.\""\n\nAccording to the indictment, Joles and Salemi are alleged to have purchased and distributed millions of dollars in diverted pharmaceuticals, which are prescription drugs illegally trafficked in a secondary or underground market (Case No. 19-20674-CR-Gayles). The indictment explains that the diverted pharmaceuticals are not controlled substances, but rather, high priced medical drugs used to treat such conditions as mental illness, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and cancer. They are branded drugs, produced by the original pharmaceutical developers as opposed to lower-priced generic drugs, but are acquired unlawfully -- through fraud, pharmacy burglaries, and cargo thefts.\n\nJoles and Salemi are alleged to have acquired such drugs in large quantities, at a cost well-below normal wholesale prices, and then introduced the diverted drugs back into the legitimate marketplace. The indictment further alleges that, because the pharmaceutical distribution system is regulated, to get diverted drugs back into the market, the diverters must, among other things, establish seemingly legitimate wholesale companies and bank accounts, produce fraudulent paperwork, and professionally package and ship the medicines to their pharmacy customers. Joles and Salemi are alleged to have produced or caused the production of fraudulent paperwork, including falsified pedigrees, which are documents that identify the products and batch numbers of pharmaceuticals, describe their dates of manufacture and origin, indicate who purchased them, show when and where they were shipped, how they were purchased, and other information needed to trace them through the marketing chain. Utilizing these false pedigrees, Joles and Salemi allegedly sold or caused the sale of these diverted pharmaceuticals to unsuspecting pharmacies and their patients.\n\nAdditionally, Joles and Salemi, with the assistance of Alvarez and Herrera, are alleged to have laundered money as part of this scheme, including conducting financial transactions to promote the carrying on of the scheme and to conceal the nature, source and ownership of the money.\n\n\""This investigation into a South Florida based drug diversion group spanned the entire country, from California to Puerto Rico,\"" said George L. Piro, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Miami Field Office. \""It is truly an example of multiple federal and state agencies working together with private industry to take out of circulation thousands of bottles of potentially dangerous drugs, and also disrupt a money laundering scheme that moved millions of dollars a month through South Florida.\""\n\n\""U.S. consumers are put at risk when prescription drugs are diverted from the FDA-regulated supply chain and then returned clandestinely for distribution to the public, as there is no longer any assurance that the products are safe and effective for their intended uses,\"" said Justin D.

LOS REYES,0,"The idea for the Annenberg Space for Photography's current exhibit W/ALLS: Defend, Divide, and The Divine came about when curator Dr. Jen Sudul Edwards and the space's director Katie Hollander contemplated the symbolic connection between this year's 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the debate over President Trump's proposed expansion of the U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\n\For many people, the fall of the Berlin Wall was a formative moment in their lives,\"" says Edwards, who's a curator of contemporary art at the Mint Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina. \""It was this momentous occasion and celebration of humanity coming together. It really opened up this idea of a global community. They saw it as an anomaly that can never be repeated. Yet walls are going up more rapidly than ever before. It's such a weird reversal of course.\""\n\nSadly, Trump's ideas about how to guard America against illegal immigration, terrorism, and crime are a sign of the times the world over. According to the United Nations, last year migrants made up 3.3% of the world's population, roughly 244 million people. In 1989, there were 15 major border walls in the world; now there are 77.\n\nAmi Vitale\n\nThis proliferation of walls has its historical precedent; and the more than 70 photographers in the display explore the function, psychology, and ideology behind barricades throughout thousands of years as ways of not only keeping people out, or in, but of perpetuating fear, hate, and ignorance.\n\n\""People don't think about how or why we got to where we are, and the ramifications of our actions now,\"" says Edwards. \""This has been human behavior for millennia.\""\n\nThe walls depicted in the collection, which is organized into six themes - \""Delineation, Defense, Deterrent, The Divine, Decoration, and The Invisible\"" - span centuries and nearly every continent, from the Great Wall of China and Hadrian's Wall. to the Israel-Palestine border and the \""peace walls\"" in Belfast, Ireland, which divided Protestant and Catholic areas. Barriers have been erected to protect lands during wars and conflicts or to limit trade. They have been meant to keep \""undesirable elements\"" at bay or in containment, whether Japanese Americans in internment camps or Jews in Polish ghettos during WWII, or undocumented immigrants crossing the deserts of North America today.\n\nPhoto by Gina Clyne.

LOS REYES,0,"It's the kind of thing they worry about in third world countries, not in America... right? RIGHT?\n\nWe have 911. We have police officers. We have law and order. But what if we didn't... because there was such a shortage?\n\nWhile enacting your duties as a police officer, that alone has a myriad of dangers. One of the most avoidable dangers associated with the role is when you're entrenched in an understaffed department.\n\nAcross the country... those shortages are getting worse and worse, no doubt as the war on police by both criminal and legislators ramps up.\n\nThe Hagerstown Police Department in Maryland is experiencing just that scenario and is causing concern within the Chief of Police. It's just one example of the challenges departments across the country are facing.\n\nHagerstown Police Chief Paul Kifer stated on Tuesday that the officers within his department are starting to get burned out coping with the realities of working within an understaffed department. Considering the aforementioned, the Chief is starting to worry that someone is going to wind up getting hurt because of the circumstances.\n\nPolice Chief Kifer had informed Mayor Bob Bruchey, who was elected back in 2016, and the Hagerstown City Council during a work session earlier in the month that the staffing levels have been below \bare bones\"" at times. So far, the department has shifted work schedules in an attempt to deal with the situation.\n\nThe police department is currently afforded to have a force of 112 officers. At the time being, Chief Kifer mentioned that there are 100 employees on the department's payroll, but some of those individuals are in a police training academy currently or they're prepping to enroll into the academy soon.\n\nThis leaves the department with about 88 \""street ready\"" officers on staff, which when taking into account the varying shifts that they'll cover leaves them with 15 officers that can be dispatched at any time.\n\nThe 15 officers on any given shift is how Chief Kifer defines as \""bare bones\"" and the Chief would much prefer having the ability to dispatch 17 officers at any time.\n\nChief Kifer mentioned that the department's peak hours for calls runs usually from 1 p.m. to 11 p.m., and there is usually a spike in officers dispatched for calls around 7 p.m. He has rearranged work shifts that place up to 16 officers on duty between 2 p.m. and 10 p.m., which inevitably pulls resources from various other shifts.\n\nWhen pondering the trouble and dangerous circumstances, Chief Kifer stated:\n\nWhile the general public that the department serves is somewhat oblivious to the detrimental effects the understaffing is causing, Chief Kifer speculated that they're likely unaware since the city officers are \""killing it every day\"" despite the current staffing.\n\nHowever, meeting staffing demands when you're short staffed typically doesn't come cheap when looking at the overall overtime costs the department is accruing. Chief Kifer had informed Mayor Bruchey that the department's overtime costs are running close to one-million dollars at this point.\n\nOf course, depending on how you look at the total cost of ownership of onboarding new officers, the overtime may not be that expensive after all. According to some of the local fire and emergency services officials in the city, they have said that paying employees overtime is holistically cheaper than hiring additional personnel when considering costs associated with benefits and additional equipment.\n\nCouncilman Kristin Aleshire sympathized with the department's situation, saying he'd heard in a recent radio news program that Baltimore has to recruit about 1,000 officers a year. The Councilman fathomed that the demand isolated in that portion of Maryland likely makes it harder for Hagerstown to find qualified officers.\n\nChief Kifer also noted that his department's situation is not unique, and that there's several departments across the country that are hurting to bring on qualified officers as well.\n\nMayor Bruchey said earlier in the month while speculating on one of the possible causes of being short staffed:\n\nChief Kifer also noted that there's other unavoidable obstacles challenging the department staffing shortage like retirements. Still, Chief Kifer said he hopes to have a force of between 107 and 110 officers by the end of next year. Even if there was a sudden surge of qualified applicants, the training academy at Hagerstown Community College which is co-run alongside with the Washington County Sheriff's Office, requires approximately six months' time to have an individual complete the required training.\n\nCarroll Braun of the Local 3373 of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees contributed to the list of possible determents to ponder with regard to the short staffing back in in April, speculating that the department's low starting pay of $40,106 is the main reason the city has trouble attracting new officers.\n\nJust last month, we reported about how departments so short staffed that they're hiring new cops with gang affiliations in some cases.\n\nAre staffing shortages and unmet recruiting goals a reason to overlook gang affiliations?\n\nOne Connecticut police department is doing exactly that by defending the hiring of an officer who was identified in background checks as someone who associated with known gang members and displayed gang-affiliated hand signals.\n\nNew Haven police issued a statement saying that the discovery was made after the officer's employment with Connecticut's Department of Correction began and during a background check as he went through the process to become a city officer.\n\nWhile the officer's name was not released, Chief Otoniel ENTITY said the officer underwent a \""laborious and intensive background check, psychological examination, drug test and polygraph test.\""\n\nFormer Chief Anthony Campbell did NOT think the officer was a suitable candidate for hire, but the Board of Police Commissioners approved the hire.\n\nENTITY said the officer is currently a member of the department in good standing.\n\nBut what if it is more than one gang member? What if it is an entire gang imbedded inside an agency, actively recruiting from within?\n\nLET dealt with that question in an article in July.\n\nThe law enforcement community is simply a microcosm of our greater society. The problems and issues we see in our communities will most likely be present in police departments, sheriff's offices and federal agencies. Issues include, alcoholism, drug use, abuse, theft, suicide and yes, even murder. But among the things that should never be present at any level, much less at a larger degree, is gang membership and activity.\n\nIt is that very alleged activity that has led the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to launch a probe into multiple gangs hidden within the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.\n\nThe Banditos, Spartans, Regulators, and Reapers are literal gangs that are claimed to exist within the Los Angeles law enforcement agency. The investigation started after allegations of abuse by the Banditos in March.\n\nAll members of the Banditos have tattoos of a skeleton wearing a sombrero, bandolier, and pistol. Allegations against these deputies include using gang tactics to recruit young Latino deputies, and punishing those who reject their advances with physical attacks.\n\nAn unidentified source told the Los Angeles Times that FBI agents:\n\nFour deputies were put on paid leave following the aforementioned allegations. Sheriff Alex Villanueva minimized the danger, calling the gangs a \""cultural norm,\"" and believes that any problems with these types of activities were eliminated as a result of previous investigations.\n\nCultural norm? Gang activity is being explained away as a cultural norm? I grew up in west Texas. Our cultural norms were things like listening to country music, going to church on Sundays and high school football on Friday nights. Never was violence inside of law enforcement simply explained away as a cultural norm. Law enforcement officials are held to a higher standard, and cannot simply sweep things under the rug.\n\nIn the last decade, there have been accusations against 'gang member' deputies of police brutality, even breaking the bones of suspects in their custody as an initiation ritual, allowing the deputies to be deemed worthy of their inclusion.\"" Sheriff Villanueva has chalked that fault up to previous leadership, saying the gangs \""ran roughshod\"" over past sheriffs.\n\nThe latest allegations stemmed from a party last September. New deputies working in East L.A. were celebrating the completion of their probationary period with the department.\n\nIt was at the end of this party when several veteran deputies showed up that things went south.\n\nDid you know that Law Enforcement Today has a private new home for those who support emergency responders and veterans? It's called LET Unity, and it's where we share the untold stories of those patriotic Americans. Every penny gets reinvested into giving these heroes a voice. Check it out today.\n\nAccording to legal documents filed against the county by seven deputies, the men belonged to the Banditos.\n\nThe claims are a precursor to a civil suit, which will seek tens of millions of dollars from the county for failing to address the hostile work environment the Banditos are alleged to have created.\n\nThe evening in question ended in violence when the Banditos are accused of attacking several of the new deputies. One rookie said he was thrown to the ground and punched in the face before being knocked unconscious. Another recalled being choked to the point of passing out.\n\nThe Sheriff's Department issued a statement this past Thursday that said it would not tolerate any form of hazing or harassment within the organization.\n\nRon Hernandez is the president of the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, the union that represents rank-and-file deputies. He said the group would withhold specific comment out of respect for the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe allegations are the latest for a department that has struggled for years to address numerous examples of secretive, gang-like deputy societies accused of committing abuses against inmates, fellow deputies and while on patrol.\n\nAccording to the L.A. Times, in July last year, then-Sheriff Jim McDonnell launched what he said would be a comprehensive study of deputy cliques after The Times revealed that a Compton station deputy involved in the fatal shooting of a black man had testified that he and as many as 20 of his colleagues had matching skull tattoos.\n\nThat inquiry went unfinished when Villanueva, a former lieutenant in the department, unseated McDonnell and took office in early December.\n\nVillanueva, who has drawn fire from critics who worry he is rolling back reforms meant to curb abuse by deputies, has at times defended deputies with station tattoos, saying they're honorable people. But he has criticized previous administrations for allowing a broader culture of hazing to fester in the department.\n\nIn comments shortly after taking office, he blamed station captains and other top officials for failing to stop a work culture of \""unchecked hazing\"" that allowed cliques to form and grow.\n\nSome deputies have defended the tattoos they share with others in their stationas a source of benign camaraderie and a way to boost morale. Some have also said they have a free-speech right to wear them.\n\nThe recent allegations are not the first against the Banditos. In 2014, the county paid a female deputy assigned to the East L.A. station $1.5 million to settle a lawsuit, in which she claimed she had been physically and mentally harassed by some of the clique's 80 members after refusing to go along with its \""traditions and initiation rituals.\""\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Hilda Solis, a member of the Board of Supervisors, said she was \""disappointed and dismayed\"" at the latest allegations.\n\nIs a lack of staffing and within police departments and sheriff's offices a valid reason to hire unqualified candidates? Is a lessening of requirements and abilities worth sacrificing\n\nWe must ask, because the shortage has begun. We see this from Dallas to Portland to Minneapolis and cities and towns in between. Let's start in Minneapolis.\n\nThe city is facing a critical police shortage as their crime rate continues to climb, with no real help or relief in sight. According to the NY Daily News:\n\nOver the past several weeks, news stories about brutal assaults and robberies have been flooding the new channels regarding Minneapolis. Complaints of 911 calls not having officers dispatched to respond to these crimes have risen, and a lack of staffing is clearly to blame.\n\nWant to know how bad that shortage is?\n\nLast year, the department was unable to immediately send a police car to 6,776 priority one emergencies.\n\nAmong those calls were shots fired, stabbings and sexual assaults.\n\nAccording to police, priority one calls involve \""an imminent threat to personal safety, or the loss or damage to property exists.\""\n\nIt gets worse. There's what's called \""priority zero\"" calls - of which police were unable to respond to seven of them.\n\nThey included a baby not breathing and a fellow officer facing imminent danger. Those calls, according to police, \""include those situations where a known crisis exists that threatens the life of an individual. This is the highest possible priority and the fastest possible response is desired. The MECC objective is to have squads en route to the call within 30 seconds of receipt by the dispatcher.\""\n\nAlondra Cano is the chair of the city's safety committee. Cano said the city council acknowledges there is a crisis and promises it's investing and diversifying its force to better represent the community.\n\nMany of the beatings that have been seen on news networks show groups of people ganging up on individuals and beating them beyond the point where they can defend themselves, at times beating them unconscious, and taking their belongings.\n\nMany of these attacks have been caught on camera as the groups are bold enough to carry out these assaults in the open without what seems a worry of the police or legal action.\n\nA video recording showed \""a group of suspects is seen on surveillance videos repeatedly punching and kicking a man in a daytime attack outside Target Field. At various points in the video, they run and jump on him, ride over him with a bicycle, take off his shoes and pants, beat him with a belt and throw what appears to be potted plants at him.\""\n\nAs reported by Fox News in a Fox & Friends interview Thursday September 19th, Lt. Bob Kroll of the Minneapolis Police Department, and the president of the Minnesota Police Officers Union, told news anchors:\n\nDue to a lack of police staffing and being able to respond to and investigate these calls - and also a lack of city support - incidents similar to this are likely continue to happen. Lt. Kroll explained:\n\nThe police officers in the city have had to handle the population explosion, without seeing any growth of their department. WCCO news reported that Police Chief Medaria Arradondo had originally asked to add 400 officers by 2025.\n\nThe mayor, however, explained that was an unrealistic expectation due to budget limitations. With this response, the Chief presented his need for 14 new officers to the Minneapolis City Council, and while some on the council felt 14 was not enough, they did agree that the need was there.\n\nWCCO reported that \""the 14 officers will include eight neighborhood outreach, three in the traffic unit and three investigators.\""\n\nHowever, Lt. Krolls feels that applicant pool for viable police candidates is ever shrinking, and he \""estimates applicants are about one-fifth the number they were around 30 years ago.\""\n\nThere will be another committee meeting on September 23where the discussion continues. Currently only two suspects from the multiple attacks have been taken into custody, and the investigations are ongoing.\n\nIn the meantime, the Plumas County sheriff's Department in California is facing criticism for a new policy that has been initiated -- their officers will no longer respond to suicide calls.\n\nCarol Quinn learned of the recently enacted policy when she had contacted the Sheriff's Department to intervene before her brother could take his own life.\n\nCarol's brother, George Quinn, 63, lived alone with his Maine Coon Cat in a remote Northern California community. The day he decided to take his own life he sent a text message to his sister, apologizing to her, and advising her to contact police.\n\nLiving over an hour away in Reno, Carol made a phone call to the Sheriff's office, hoping they would respond and save her brother's life. But Carol was shocked to learn that deputies would not be responding to intervene.\n\nCarol was told by the department, that they would not be responding as there was no way to be certain that the situation would not end in \""suicide by cop\"".\n\nWhile Plumas County may be the department involved in bringing this type of policy national attention, they are not the only department in the state of California that are considering changing their response policies to reflect this.\n\nLarge departments like Los Angeles and San Francisco have units that were specifically created to respond to calls of distressed or suicidal individuals. They typically consist of an officer and a mental health professional. A unit that has the tools to deal with the potential mental health aspects of this type of call.\n\nSmaller departments do not have the funds or the staffing to put together these types of teams. Rather than risking the lives of officers or innocent bystanders, and potentially creating situations where officers may be forced to take the life of a distressed individual-if there are no direct threats to other individuals, or no crimes being committed-they will no longer respond.\n\nAs reported by the Los Angeles Times:\n\n\""In a 2009 study of more than 700 officer-involved shootings nationwide, 36% of incidents were determined to be attempts at provoking officers to use deadly force.\""\n\nWhile some critics feel that, 'suicide by cop' is only a mean to justify police brutality, other studies have shown up to half of the calls where police respond to a suicidal person, they are forced to take the persons life.\n\nEven though there is criticism of this type of change in the way departments respond to these calls to service, there are many who defend law enforcement's need to rethink how these situations are handled.\n\nPsychiatry Professor, John Reid Meloy, from UC San Diego defends policy changes stating to the Los Angeles times:\n\nThis is a call to service that comes in to departments all too often.\n\nPlumas County may be one of the first departments in California to officially enact this type of policy but California Police Chiefs Association President, Ron Lawrence, has acknowledge that other departments have less formal but similar ways of handling these types of calls.\n\nNot responding to the need for their assistance may go against everything officers intuitively feel but Lawrence went on to explain to the Times reporter, \""...we have just learned through evolution that sometimes police presence is not the answer.\""\n\nWhile there are officers that wonder, what if it was someone that they cared for that was making the call for help in a situation like this, a greater discussion about mental and behavioral health has been initiated because of these new policy changes. Admittedly, police alone cannot hope to resolve the growing need for response to suicidal individuals.\n\nLarger departments in California are putting funds and greater efforts behind 'disengagement' response policies. A collaborative effort between officers and mental health clinicians that are dispatched together to a call of a suicidal person, have proven to work to diffuse the situation and end where the suspect receives the mental health help that they need.\n\nThis type of efforts between first responders and mental health providers may be the ideal situation for these types of calls, but many of the smaller departments do not have the ability to put these teams together, just based on geographical location alone.\n\nMono County Sheriff's office near Yosemite National Park is one of those very departments. Ingrid Braun, sheriff of the department explained to the Los Angeles Times, \""the nearest emergency mental health bed in her county is five hours south in Bakersfield, and the county currently has no behavioral health practitioners who can respond to urgent calls.\""\n\nHowever not responding to suicide calls is not an ideal solution for her department, so she is working on having medics respond to these types of calls along with officers.\n\nThere is acknowledgement that the greater discussions need to take place amongst officers and mental health professionals to combat the growing need for officers to respond to suicidal individuals. Braun brings to light that, the response of just officers alone to these types of calls may not be the best way to handle the situation, \""If you call because you are bottoming out and you need help, we send men with guns...'\n\nThe executive director of the non-profit, Suicide Awareness Voices of Education, Dan Reidenberg, also acknowledges that there are risks to officers responding to these types of calls, but no response at all is not the answer either. Reidenberg stated to the Times:\n\nThere are growing fears that the lack of response by law enforcement to these types of calls will rapidly increase the rate of suicides -- which has already been on the rise in recent years.\n\nAs for Carol Quinn, she and her friend Pat Costin, ultimately made the hour-long drive to her brother's house the day police would told her they would not respond to Carol's request to intervene in her brother's potential suicide. Pat was the one to find George Quinn hanging from the rafters of his wood shop by a chain-dead.\n\nAfter discovering the body, Pat contacted the Plumas Co. Sheriff's Department to report that, it was \""safe for them to come now.\"" Pat went on to further explain that, unlike police officers, he was never trained to handle the situation that he walked into.\n\nPat explained that the images of his friend hanging haunt him, and he is happy that Carol did not need to see what he had found.While he and Carol are both police supporters, they disagree with the nonresponse policy, something needs to change.\n\nIn April, Portland, Oregon lost a huge chunk of its police presence.\n\nClackamas County Sheriff Craig Roberts wrote an email to his deputies, stating his concern for their safety.\n\nThe city of Portland is largely patrolled by the Portland Police Bureau and receives support from neighboring counties like Clackamas Sheriff's Department. With this decision, remaining officers in the area will no doubt feel the stress of being understaffed.\n\nThe announcement came as Portland was bracing for its next protest - May Day, where a protest for immigrant and worker's rights was set for downtown. In 2017, 25 people were arrested in the gathering after the rally turned into a violent clash.\n\nDemonstrators were charged with disorderly conduct, arson, theft, assault, vandalism and more. Officers maintaining order at the march were quickly attacked by left wing anarchists who threw full cans of soda and other projectiles.\n\nThe decision to stop responding to routine calls was made following a statement released by the Portland Police Association.\n\nDue to the overwhelming 'anti-police' attitudes in the city of Portland, some officials are stepping in to say, 'no more.' Enter - Sheriff Craig Roberts.\n\nPortland Mayor Ted Wheeler is concerned. He asked Sheriff Roberts to wait to enact his decision until after the May Day protest, but failed.\n\n\""False narratives, knee jerk political reactions, along with personal and political agendas have created a hostile work environment and made it an impossible task to effectively police in the City of Portland. Our police officers are frustrated. They deserve better. They deserve to work in an environment where they can perform their primary function -- keeping our communities safe -- with the support of City Hall. Similarly, our communities are frustrated. They deserve better. They deserve safe, clean streets. It's that simple,\"" the PPA's post read.\n\nPortland officer have repeatedly been told to stand down during past protests. Mayor Wheeler tends to side with the liberal agenda, taking protests as just people expressing their feelings. But things have gotten violent a number of times.\n\nLET columnist James Lewis is a former LEO and served in the Air Force. He used to live in a suburb outside Portland, and is upset to see the way it has changed over the years. One of the biggest issues in the area?\n\nThe Police Commissioner also sits as the City Manager. Conflict of interest? Many say yes. The same individual that is supposed to be the head of local law enforcement is also making daily decisions about city works, budgets and more. Portland heads even consulted the head of Black Lives Matter when creating the 2019 contract for police.\n\nLewis says companies like Intel and Nike drew lot's of families from California up to the city. Those families stayed, thus leading to a big change in culture.\n\nThe Washington County Sheriff's Department also made a similar move in February, announcing they would be providing less support for Portland calls.\n\nSheriff's Roberts' email to his deputies can be read in full below.\n\nSheriff's Office Change in Services within the City of Portland\n\nTo all Clackamas County Sheriff's Office employees: I want to give you an important update on changes to services we provide in the City of Portland.\n\nAs you know, our command staff and executive team have been actively assessing the risk of your work within the City of Portland.\n\nRecently, Undersheriff Brandenburg met with many of our deputies assigned to answering routine calls for service in the City of Portland to listen to their concerns related to safety. I've also had conversations with other city, state and federal law enforcement leaders, including Portland Police Chief Outlaw. Lastly, I've taken into account the Portland Police Association's concerns outlined in their April 8 statement, which you can read here. As I said in my earlier email on this topic, I will not place you at unnecessary personal and professional risk.\n\nAs a result of these and other assessments, the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office will pull back all staff responding to calls for services within the City of Portland in the coming weeks. Those actions are as follows:\n\nWe are working with TriMet to develop a new Intergovernmental Agreement that will reassign deputies to meet the public safety needs of citizens accessing TriMet within Clackamas County. We intend to continue assigning one sergeant and six deputies to provide timely responses for law enforcement services and maintain passenger safety.\n\nWith respect to deployment of special teams, we will evaluate requests for assistance on a case-by-case basis. This applies to SWAT, the Crisis Negotiations Team (CNT), and the Rapid Response Team (RRT/CERT).\n\nWe will continue our participation on the United States Marshals Fugitive Task Force and the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force.\n\nNo changes will be made to operations involving Corrections staff who work the Electronic Home Detention Program, Parole and Probation staff who supervise clients in the City of Portland, and the Metropolitan Explosive Disposal Unit (MEDU). All will continue with their regular duties.\n\nI don't make these decisions lightly. I appreciate and commend the difficult work Portland Police officers do every day, and I also commend Portland Police Chief Outlaw for her leadership in a very difficult environment. I admire her commitment to improving public safety and community relations.\n\nAs Sheriff, your safety and the safety of Clackamas County residents remain my top priorities. Our work is dangerous enough without adding unnecessary risk when responding to calls for services in the City of Portland.\n\nI also want to make this clear: We will always respond to help any officer from any agency in immediate need of assistance."
LOS REYES,0,"In what could be one of the most gruesome ways to lose your life, a young mother was made to helplessly watch home invaders saw off her young son and daughter's heads before being murdered herself.\n\nFive-year old A'Laylaih Fisher was stabbed 20 times before police say her killer Michael Collins, 26, tried to remove her head. They say Collins then stabbed A'Layaih's four-year old brother Elijah 14 times before decapitating him at the family's home in Little Rock, Arkansas, in December 2017.\n\nThe youngsters' mother, Mariah Cunningham, 24, was allegedly held down by Collins' accomplice, William Burnell Alexander, 23, and forced to watch before she too was stabbed to death. Prosecutor Barbara Mariana revealed the horrific details during the opening day of Collins' capital murder trial Wednesday.\n\nShe told jurors it had only taken him 20 minutes to 'annihilate' Mariah and her children after he and half-brother Alexander robbed the family's apartment. Jurors at Pulaski County Court heard how the family had been slaughtered just for a TV, Xbox and Cunningham's broken-down Honda, which was abandoned shortly afterwards. Collins and Alexander mistakenly believed the mother was wealthy.\n\nCollins had previously lodged with Mariah, with Mariana telling jurors the killings were:\n\nDespite a capital murder charge carrying a maximum sentence of death, Collins will not be executed now that he has been convicted.\n\nThe court heard how Collins allegedly fled to Chicago after the killings, with local cops directing US Marshals to an address where he was staying. There, federal agents are said to have found the suspect asleep on a couch, next to a pair of Adidas trainers splattered with his alleged victims' blood.\n\nCollins was taken into custody - and is then said to have confessed to what he'd done to a fellow inmate after claiming Mariah's ghost had haunted him. That cellmate - bank robber Marino Bernard Scott, 47, came forward to police to share how Collins had been wracked with guilt by what he is accused of doing.\n\nProsecutor Marinara said:\n\nCollins denied the charges he faces, with his defense attorney Katherine Streett yet to unveil his version of events. The jury deliberated less than a half an hour before finding Collins guilty of a triple murder.\n\nProsecutors were able to convince a jury that Collins, along with half-brother Alexander, traveled to the Little Rock home of Mariah Cunningham in December 2017 with grisly intent.\n\nThe bodies were found by Cunningham's 78-year-old grandmother, who had gone to the house after her phone calls were not returned.\n\nPolice found bleach on the bodies and a steak knife believed to be the murder weapon in the bathtub. Although the prosecution had no witnesses, they brought the case based on material evidence.\n\nArkansas detective Terry McDaniel connected Collins with the victim and was able to determine he had left the state. He alerted U.S. marshals and five days after the crime, they found him in Chicago. A search found blood on Collins' shoes. DNA testing revealed that the blood matched all three victims.\n\nIn addition, Collins' cellmate, Marino Bernard Scott, testified that during the 30 days they had been in jail, Collins had confessed to him that he had gone to Cunningham's house to see if she would give him money. When she refused, he began to \punish\"" her children.\n\nCollins did not testify at the trial, and his public defense attorney only presented a single piece of evidence to argue that the victims' DNA was present on the shoes because he had briefly lived with the family.\n\nIn April, prosecutors announced that they would seek the death penalty in the case. However, they then waived that request at the start of the trial. The guilty verdict will result in Collins spending life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nAlexander is scheduled to stand trial next month.\n\nDid you know that Law Enforcement Today has a private new home for those who support emergency responders and veterans? It's called LET Unity, and it's where we share the untold stories of those patriotic Americans. Every penny gets reinvested into giving these heroes a voice. Check it out today.\n\nHere's another story that largely flew under the radar in the mainstream media. Probably because it involves two allegedly illegal MS-13 gang members committing murder in a sanctuary city.\n\nKing County prosecutors have filed murder charges against two men in King County, Washington. They say they men killed and dismembered a 16-year-old boy in Auburn last month, then tossed his body in the Green River.\n\nThey two - Rudy Osvaldo Garcia-Hernandez, 28, and Carlos Orlando Iraheta-Vega, 20, are both being charged with premeditated first-degree murder and are being held in King County Jail in lieu of $3 million bail.\n\nAccording to police, they Juan Carlos Con Guzman, a student at Mount Rainier High School in Des Moines, from his home to fight on September 10. Prosecutors say the men then drove to a remote location near the river \""with a plan to torture and kill him\"".\n\nThe murder was gruesome and prosecutors say it shows how ruthless MS-13 is.\n\nSenior Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Mary Barbosa said the suspects beat Con Guzman with a baseball bat. Then, while he was still alive, they hit the boy him repeatedly with a machete and dismembering him.\n\nAccording to Detectives with the King County Sheriff's Office, the men are members of the transnational gang MS-13, or La Mara Salvatrucha and are here illegally.\n\nThe gang was formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s by refugees from El Salvador and has been linked to vicious murders across America.\n\nIt's one of the cases that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has used to go after King County officials for their policy to not abide by ICE detainers without a judicial warrant.\n\nThey have plenty of examples, including recent violent crimes in Bellevue and Seattle.\n\nIn this particular case, ICE said Iraheta-Vega is an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador.\n\nDemocrats and the media have attacked ICE, saying they're using it as a \""public relations offensive\"".\n\nKing County Executive Dow Constantine said that what they call a PR move is actually a group of people who give a damn about enforcing the law.\n\nHere are details of the charges:\n\nOn September 10, sheriff's deputies responded to reports of a body in the Green River in Auburn and located a large amount of blood leading to Con Guzman's submerged body.\n\nThe report came back from the King County Medical Examiner's Office. It said Con Guzman was killed by a combination of blunt-force injuries to the head and cutting injuries to his neck.\n\nHe was going to turn 17-years-old in just a few weeks. In the missing persons report, his parents said he came home from work around 2 a.m. the morning he was killed. They said he took off shortly after.\n\nHere's how detectives caught the duo.\n\nThe secured surveillance footage from a number of locations showing Con Guzman get into a car near his home.\n\nThat car then made a stop at a Federal Way apartment building before heading east on Highway 18.\n\nThe victim's friends told detectives he had a friend who was an MS-13 gang member - and it was a description that Iraheta-Vega matched on Facebook, where they say he also claimed to be an MS-13 member. They picked him up and said he spilled to them.\n\nAccording to detectives, Iraheta-Vega said he told the victim to come outside to fight and settle a dispute.\n\nThat's when they apparently picked up Garcia-Hernandez, who Iraheta-Vega identified as an MS-13 member, and headed to the river.\n\nAccording to Iraheta-Vega, they had a fist fight and then Garcia-Hernandez pulled out a short machete after and began hacking Con Guzman's neck.\n\nDetectives said Iraheta-Vega was a huge help in the investigation - showing them the location of a machete, which he claimed Garcia-Hernandez buried after washing the blade.\n\nThere was another witness that apparently gave detectives a similar story, but added that Iraheta-Vega beat the victim with a baseball bat - a detail he left out initially.\n\nWhen they arrested him, he told detectives he did strike the victim with a bat, according to charges.\n\nIn their investigation, detectives said they found a machete in his room with what appeared to be blood on the blade.\n\nThe next day, they arrested Garcia-Hernandez. Not before a brief encounter with them during which they said he pulled out a gun. We're told they opened fire but didn't hit him.\n\nDid you know that Law Enforcement Today has a private new home for those who support emergency responders and veterans? It's called LET Unity, and it's where we share the untold stories of those patriotic Americans. Every penny gets reinvested into giving these heroes a voice. Check it out today.\n\nIt sure does aline with a similar slaughter in the Bronx.\n\nThey are being described as \""remorseless to the end\"".\n\nAs five Trinitarios gang members were sentenced to life in prison for the brutal machete murder of an innocent kid, they flashed gun signs with their cuffed hands to the media.\n\nThey were convicted in the slaughter of Lesandro 'Junior' Guzman in what was described as being a case of mistaken identity in the Bronx.\n\nJudge Robert Neary handed down each of the sentences separately.\n\nFirst, he condemned 25-year-old Jonaiki Martinez Estrella to life behind bars without the possibility of parole.\n\nHe's the one who gave the fatal blow to Guzman's neck.\n\nThen came sentences of 25-years to life for his co-defendants, Antonio Rodriguez Hernandez Santiago, 25, Jose Muniz, 23 and Elvin Garcia, 25.\n\nThe final gang member was 19-year-old Manuel Rivera. He's the one who dragged and knifed the innocent teen in June of 2018. Because of his age, he was given a lesser sentence of 23 years to life.\n\nIt took more than a year for the sentences to be handed down after the slaughter of the 15-year-old kid, who was hacked to death with machetes and knives on the corner of East 183rd Street and Bathgate Avenue on June 20, 2018.\n\nThroughout the hearing, Estrella and Muniz laughed and made gun gestures towards photographers in the courtroom.\n\nJunior's mother and father shared crushing victim impact statements at the hearing.\n\nTheir son was a young Police Explorer who wanted to help.\n\nJunior's father, Lisandro Guzman, opened his heart as well.\n\nHe told the courtroom that he now struggles to sleep. He dreads every weekend because they're a constant reminder his beloved son is no longer around.\n\nHe said the pain they inflicted knows no bounds.\n\nHe prays they never leave prison.\n\nOne of the gang bangers mothers, Rodriguez Hernandez Santiago, got up and started screaming after the judge handed down her son's lengthy term.\n\nShe shouted:\n\nThe mother of the criminal then out of the courtroom.\n\nThe jury handed down convictions for the five Trinitarios gang members on charges of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, second-degree conspiracy and second-degree gang assault, in June. The verdict came less than a week before the anniversary of the murder.\n\nIt was all captured on surveillance camera. Footage showed the moment Junior ran into the bodega, chased by two hooded men shortly before midnight, begging the cashier for help.\n\nYou could then see one of the men signal to a group of five other criminals, who were gathered on a nearby street corner.\n\nThen the group dragged the 15-year-old out of the store. It was captured on camera as Junior tried desperately to get out of their grasp, holding on the corner of the shop's door frame before being pulled out into the street\n\nThe group started the attack, using a number of knives and a machete, stabbing him over and over again as he lay on the floor trying to dodge the blows.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the killers later found out Junior wasn't who they thought he was.\n\nIt was a tragic case of mistaken identity, with his killers wrongly believing him to be a member of a rival gang.\n\nDuring the trial in June, Trinitarios gang member Michael Sosa ENTITY turned and cooperated with the prosecution. He told the court that murderer Estrella callously bragged that his victim was 'not going to eat for a very long time because I hit him in the neck' as the killers ran.\n\nBut it turns out Estrella did more than just hit Guzman in the neck.\n\nHe used a four-and-a-half inch knife to slice the defenseless 15-year-old's jugular vein, which caused him to bleed to death.\n\nENTITY went on to say ringleader Diego Suero ordered his disciples from the 'Bad Boys' crew to inflict 'any kind of damage' on rival gang members that fateful evening.\n\nHe said the gang gathered inside Suero's apartment, which was only a block away from the bodega on East 183rd Street.\n\nAccording to ENTITY, that meant:\n\nIt was only minutes after that when the gang members spotted aspiring NYPD detective Junior walking the streets. They thought he was a notorious member of the rival Sunset Crew.\n\nThey followed him in cars, then hunted down the terrified teen on foot.\n\nENTITY told the jury in June about how he chased Junior inside the bodega, falsely telling the shopkeeper the boy had 'done something' to his grandmother, and needed to be dealt with.\n\nBut ENTITY claims he couldn't go through with Suero's order after looking Junior in the eyes and seeing just how petrified he was.\n\nBut he didn't do anything to stop his fellow gang members, instead watching as they dragged Junior out of the shop by his ankles, and savagely hacked away at him with knives and a machete right on the street.\n\nMedia outlets reported more on what followed:\n\nAccording to reporting media outlets, ten men were arrested on Wednesday and five remained at large until Thursday when they were finally caught.\n\nManhattan District Attorney's Office's Violent Criminal Enterprises Unit and the NYPD's Bronx Gang Squad were in charge of the case, which began partially by the June 20, 2018 murder of Guzman-Feliz which five men were convicted of this June.\n\nAccording to police, the duo used the Facebook owned service to stay in contact with more than 100 Los Sures members. That's a subset of the Trinitario gang which then worked to set 'missions' for fellow gang members to carry out attacks on members of the Washington Heights-based F.E.B subset, which they believed was 'illegitimate'.\n\nAccording to the indictment, two incidents took place on October 19, 2017.\n\nIn one of them, a group of approximately 20 men, including five of the new defendants, gathered in Fort Tryon Park before chasing the first victim into a bodega on the corner of West 192nd Street and St. Nicholas Avenue.\n\nCourt documents show that the alleged gang members were holding a bat, knives, and a machete, and the victim hid behind the deli counter before they chased him outside and tried to attack him. He escaped with only minor injuries.\n\nNot long after, the group attacked a second man, repeatedly stabbing him and striking him with the bat and machete, according to the indictment.\n\nThat victim was attacked on Audubon Avenue between West 192nd and West 193rd Streets, which was only a block away from the first incident.\n\nPolice said he suffered three chop wounds to the head, a skull fracture, stab wounds, collapsed lungs, and a severed tendon in his wrist.\n\nThere's more. The gang members were also charged in relation to a November 6, 2017 incident.\n\nIn that one, another group of men, including six of the new defendants, gathered in the same park before attacking two men near Broadway and Dongan Place.\n\nPolice said they had a gun, knives, batons, and a lock, and that one of the victims was stabbed repeatedly and the other was slashed from the back of his neck to the middle of his cheek.\n\nThen there was a fifth attack related to the new indictments. This one was the stabbing at gunpoint of a man on the corner of 192nd Street and St. Nicholas Avenue.\n\nAccording to court documents, after being knifed in the stomach, the attackers hit him in the head with the lock and chased him into a Kennedy Fried Chicken Store.\n\nHe was talking about the gang, which mainly recruits people from the Dominican Republic.\n\nHe said the battle continues.\n\nAccording to court documents, Perez - aka 'Stackz' and 'Menol de Robbinnn,' as well as Lorenzo aka 'El Menor' were among those charged on 11 counts including Conspiracy in the Third and Fourth Degrees, Attempted Murder in the Second Degree, Assault in the First and Second Degrees, and Gang Assault in the First Degree.\n\nBack to the case of the murdered teen... we've learned that former gang members had testified against Lorenzo.\n\nPolice say Elvin Garcia is connected to the case, but say he was already in custody due to being convicted of Guzman-Feliz's murder.\n\nRaimy Carrasco, 19, Jery Peguero, 23, Oliver Fernandez, 25, Christopher Acosta,20, and Jorge Marques-Neto, 23, were on the run on Wednesday but were the last of the 15 to be taken in before the indictments."
