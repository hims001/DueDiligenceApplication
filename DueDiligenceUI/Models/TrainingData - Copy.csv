(PRWEB) October 11, 2019\n\nFor the first time, Today's Inspired Latina (TIL), an internationally acclaimed book series highlighting the success stories of Latinas, invited several young Hispanic women to speak about their personal experiences on the stage of North Central College's Wentz Concert Hall in Naperville, Illinois.\n\nShared on ENTITY, a worldwide audience met 12 dynamic local high school and college-age speakers who displayed poise, grace and a positive energy. Taking the stage were Evelyn Lozano, Alondra Ivette Guevara, Arianna Urrutia, Gina Aridal Pardino, Giselle Gonzalez, Andrea Vallejo, Samantha Ante, Maria Clara Ospina, Daniela Limon, Yahayra Argueta, Erica Franco and Scarlett Magana.\n\nJacqueline Camacho-Ruiz, Today's Inspired Latina's creator, beamed with pride and joy as she explained that the event idea came from Elizabeth Colón-Rivera, a TIL author, who suggested that young Latinas do a Latina Talks event of their own after participating in one. Jelena Sánchez, assistant professor of Spanish, Modern Languages at North Central College and another TIL author, also helped Camacho-Ruiz in finding the location for these talks. With the stage set, Camacho-Ruiz immediately started planning.\n\n\""When things are aligned, they happen,\"" she said. \""I began putting in a lot of 'heart' work -- not hard work-to make this happen,\"" she said.\n\nAt the event, Colón-Rivera spoke about the powerful emotional impact that she experienced participating during a Latina Talks event. She was impressed by the resilience these presenters displayed.\n\n\""You are our next generation,\"" she said. \""When I got on that stage and spoke at the Latina Talks, I thought it would be a great idea for the next generation to speak about their own experiences about bullying, respect, self-love, the loss of a parent, owning their power and about pressure. Your stories are impactful. You have an amazing journey ahead of you.\""\n\nAdditionally, the speakers were also vying for two college scholarships: a $1,000 Amazing Young Latina Scholarship and the newly created $500 Latina Leaders Scholarship awarded to a North Central College student. A panel of TIL Authors -- Colón-Rivera, Sánchez, Neli Vazquez Rowland, Macarena Tamayo-Calabrese, Jeannette Lurdez Collazo and Tamika Lecheé Morales -- chose Urrutia for the Amazing Young Latina Scholarship and Ospina for the Latina Leadership Scholarship.\n\nUrrutia, a North Central College senior who is also expecting her first child, shared an emotional story about the loss of her father as a result of a drug-induced overdose. She explained how many individuals will endure obstacles in their lives but the ultimate factor is how they move forward.\n\n\""You are continuously going to be challenged in life and you are continuously going to have to make hard choices,\"" she said. \""One of those choices is going to be how you move on (in your life.) Regardless of what happens, you have to move on. You have to keep going forward. You know why? If you don't who is going to pay the bills, secure your future and take care your family. No one. You only have yourself.\""\n\nMaking this event possible were the following sponsors: Metaphrasis, Fig Factor Media Publishing, Conectando Corazones, North Central College, Urban Air Adventure Park, 1 2 3 Got My Job, Ollin Technology and Jeannette Lurdez Collazo.\n\nFor more information about Today's Inspired Latina, visit: http://todayslatina.com.\n\nAbout Today's Inspired Latina:\n\nToday's Inspired Latina is a book series of inspiration and hope, a poignant collection of personal stories that will activate your passion.

Facebook,0,"BANGKOK - The Chinese embassy in Bangkok has condemned Thai politicians for showing support to Hong Kong activists amid mass anti-Beijing protests, saying that such move could harm the relationship between the two countries.\n\nThe criticism was echoed by Thailand's army chief, who on Friday spoke of \hidden agendas\"" in meetings between opposition activists.\n\nThe embassy statement, posted on its official ENTITY page late on Thursday, came days after Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong posted a picture on social media with prominent Thai opposition figure Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit.\n\n\""Some Thai politicians have contacted the group that wants to separate Hong Kong from China, showing gestures of support,\"" the embassy said in a Thai-language statement without naming individuals.\n\n\""This is wrong and irresponsible. China hopes that relevant people will understand the truth about problems in Hong Kong, act carefully and do useful things for the friendship between China and Thailand.\""\n\nWong and Thanathorn met on Oct. 5 at the Open Future Festival in Hong Kong, attending as speakers at the annual event.\n\n\""Under the hard-line authoritarian suppression, we stand in solidarity,\"" Wong wrote in a tweet that showed a picture of him standing next to the Thai politician.\n\nThanathorn's Future Forward Party declined to comment when contacted by Reuters on Friday.\n\nThai army chief General Apirat Kongsompong indirectly criticized Thanathorn's meeting with Wong on Friday during a press briefing in which he accused opposition politicians of inappropriate behavior.\n\n\""Wong came to Thailand countless of times. To meet whom? The meetings had hidden agendas. Were they conspiring, cooking up something together?\"" Apirat said.\n\n\""And with the incidents in Hong Kong, someone went, to give moral support, to give encouragement,\"" Apirat added, showing the picture of Thanathorn and Wong that was posted on social media, though Thanathorn's body was blacked out.\n\nThailand was run by a military junta for five years after then-army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha overthrew an elected government.\n\nElections held in July were won by Prayuth's pro-army party in a vote that opposition parties said was organized to ensure the continuation of military control of politics.\n\nThe Thai Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the Chinese embassy's statement but referred to a statement in September stating that Thailand regards the situation in Hong Kong as China's internal affairs."

To mark the milestone in the promotion's history, ONE will be putting together a two-part fight card that features a handful of their biggest stars as well as a number of exciting prospects.\n\nOn that day, one of the Philippines' fastest rising stars steps into the biggest opportunity of his career, as Team Lakay's Danny \""The King\"" Kingad faces former long-time UFC Flyweight World Champion and American MMA icon Demetrious \""Mighty Mouse\"" Johnson in the finals of the ONE Flyweight World Grand Prix.\n\nThe winner takes home the ONE Flyweight World Grand Prix Championship, but most importantly, he gets a shot at the ONE Flyweight World Championship.\n\nThis is Danny Kingad's Road to ONE: CENTURY.\n\nAfter winning his first four professional bouts, Kingad made the jump to ONE Championship in 2016 and immediately put the division on notice, winning his debut by way of first-round TKO via ground and pound. He would follow that up with two more wins to improve his record to 7-0.\n\nThe impressive start was enough for him to earn a shot at the ONE Flyweight World Championship, held by Brazilian star Adriano Moraes.\n\nPerhaps pushed into the situation too quickly, the young Kingad succumbed to the more experienced Moraes and absorbed the first defeat of his young career.\n\nThe young Team Lakay standout bounced back in impressive fashion, stringing together three consecutive wins and then earning himself a shot at entering the ONE Flyweight World Grand Prix.\n\nIn his \""qualifying match\"" so to speak, Kingad bested Japanese grappler Tatsumitsu Wada to earn a spot in the eight-man flyweight tournament.\n\nIn his ONE Flyweight Grand Prix Quarterfinal match, Kingad outclassed Pancrase champion Senzo Ikeda in Tokyo to advance into the semifinals and move one step closer to the title.\n\nIn the semifinals, Kingad was originally slated to face former champion Kairat Akhmetov, but an injury forced the Kazakh to withdraw. Taking Akhmetov's place was former title challenger Reece McLaren.\n\nAgainst McLaren, Kingad was pushed to the limit, getting outgrappled in the first two rounds before rallying back and dominating the third round to sway the judges' decision to his favor and advance to the tournament finale.\n\nAs it fate would have it, Kingad would find himself matched up with an idol and an opponent he's wanted to face for a long time, Demetrious Johnson.\n\nThe American former champion also dominated his side of the bracket, setting up the must-see Final match.\n\nWhat's more is that Kingad will have the chance to showcase his talents on a much bigger audience, with his match against Johnson being the co-main event of ONE Century Part I, which will air on primetime television in the United States.\n\nCatch ONE: CENTURY in it's entirety on LIVESTREAMING on Sunday, October 13 starting at 8:00 AM (Part 1) and 4:00 PM (Part 2) via sports.abs-cbn.com/livestream/one and on iWant Sports as well as on the ABS-CBN Sports ENTITY Page and the ABS-CBN Sports YouTube Page!\n\nCatch ONE: CENTURY Part 2 LIVE at 6:30 PM on ABS-CBN S+A channel 23!\n\nONE: CENTURY Part 1 will air on Friday, October 18 at 8:30 PM on ABS-CBN S+A channel 23"

Epic is the most widely-used and comprehensive health records system in the country. The EHR implementation project started at AHS over three years ago as part of an effort to enhance care across the system, increase coordination of care, and improve the patient care experience.\n\n\We're committed to meeting the unique needs of our community and are very excited about the multiple benefits the new EHR system means for improved clinical efficiency, health management and patient care,\"" said Delvecchio Finley, CEO, Alameda Health System. \""Investing in this robust technology that equips our teams with a single electronic health record means that AHS will be able to deliver better integrated care, with added convenience, to our patients.\""\n\nWith the new EHR system, patients and their designated caregivers will have 24-hour access to their health record and comprehensive health history simply by using an app.\n\nOnce they have enrolled, AHS patients will gain access to Epic's patient portal, MyAlamedaHealth*, putting critical health data right at their fingertips. MyAlamedaHealth is expected to significantly streamline services by offering the ability to self-schedule appointments, send reminders about preventative screening and routine care, provide online access to request prescription refills, view lab and test results, pay bills and message their care team.\n\n\""To get a hold of my doctor I have to transfer through so many calls and then it takes some time for him to get the message and get back to me. This way I can contact him directly,\"" said patient J. Jose Franco. \""I'm really excited to enroll. I can't wait to see the results.\""\n\nHospital staff received extensive EHR training last month and will utilize the new system to streamline administrative tasks and facilitate the secure exchange of critical patient information and data to care teams at all AHS facilities or to any other health care provider patients choose.\n\nHaving implemented Epic, AHS now has the capacity to exchange data with other interoperable systems. This means that AHS can seamlessly share patient data, greatly enhancing care coordination and clinical decision-making, among providers which will improve the quality and safety of care as well as the patient experience. Providers will have the ability to coordinate care with clinicians outside of AHS who serve their patients and their families, closing care gaps and reducing duplication.\n\n\""Implementing this system is a foundational milestone to our health care delivery system with the aim to provide truly integrated, high quality, and safe care to our patients and community.

Facebook,0,"The best way to combat a \snake fish\"" is by cutting off its head.\n\nAn invasive Asian snakehead fish that can grow to almost a metre long and exist on land has surfaced in Georgia for the first time. Wildlife officials in the US state have formulated a foolproof animal control measure - killing it on sight.\n\nA denizen of China's Yangtze River basin, the northern snakehead was caught in a private pond in Gwinnett County northeast of Atlanta in early October, Georgia Department of Natural Resources officials announced on Wednesday.\n\nAn angler's report allowed them to \""confirm the presence\"" after identifying the fish's mottled brown colouring, a dorsal fin traversing the back and the serpentine noggin from which the fish takes its name.\n\n\""We are now taking steps to determine if they have spread from this water body and, hopefully, keep it from spreading to other Georgia waters,\"" said Matt Thomas, chief of fisheries for the DNR's Wildlife Resources Division.\n\nIt would be bad news if the fishy interloper spreads. The federally regulated snakehead is a voracious hunter with no natural predators in North America and has the potential to displace local wildlife by commandeering their food resources and habitat, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\n\nEven scarier, these serpentine swimmers can breathe air - allowing them to exist on land for days at a time.\n\nTo combat the invasion, Georgia's Wildlife Resources Division posted a notice on their ENTITY page, urging fishers to \""immediately kill and freeze any suspected snakeheads as well as snap photos of their quarry\"".\n\nAnglers should also note where it was caught - water body, GPS co-ordinates - and \""report their find to their regional Georgia DNR Wildlife Resources Division Fisheries Office\"".\n\nThe post sparked a flurry of remarks from the FB peanut gallery, most concerning the snakehead's purported deliciousness. Said one comment section gourmand, \""Just wondering if we have to cut the head off and leave them on the bank, or if we CAN take them home to eat?\""\n\nIndeed, the \""ferocious fish\"" is a staple of hotpot restaurants throughout China.\n\nBut for US wildlife officials, the snakehead scourge is no laughing matter. The species has already been reported in 14 states."

Facebook,0,"""WASHINGTON: Ahead of the annual Blueberry Festival in Marshall County, Indiana, in early September, a woman broadcast a warning to her neighbors on ENTITY.\n\n\""I just heard there's supposed to be a mass shooting tonight at the fireworks,\"" the woman, whose name is held to protect her privacy, said in a post in a private ENTITY Group with over 5,000 members.\n\n\""Probably just a rumor or kids trying to scare people, but everyone keep their eyes open,\"" she said in the post, which was later deleted.\n\nThere was no shooting at the Blueberry Festival that night, and the local police said there was no threat.\n\nBut the post sparked fear in the community, with some group members canceling their plans to attend, and shows the power of rumors in ENTITY Groups, which are often private or closed to outsiders. Groups allow community members to quickly spread information, and possibly misinformation, to users who trust the word of their neighbors.\n\nThese groups and other private features, rather than public feeds, are \""the future\"" of social media, ENTITY Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in April, revealing their importance to ENTITY's business model.\n\nThe threat of misinformation spreading rapidly in Groups shows a potential vulnerability in a key part of the company's growth strategy. It could push ENTITY to invest in expensive human content monitoring at the risk of limiting the ability to post in real-time, a central benefit of Groups and ENTITY in general that has attracted millions of users to the platform.\n\nWhen asked if ENTITY takes accountability for situations like the one in Indiana, a company spokeswoman said it is committed to maintaining groups as a safe place, and that it encourages people to contact law enforcement if they see a potential threat.\n\nENTITY Groups can also serve as a tool for connecting social communities around the world, such as ethnic groups, university alumni and hobbyists.\n\nENTITY's WhatsApp messaging platform faced similar but more serious problems in 2018 after false messages about child abductors led to mass beatings of more than a dozen people in India, some of whom have died. WhatsApp later limited message forwards and began labeling forwarded messages to quell the risk of fake news.\n\nFIREWORKS FEAR\n\nThe Blueberry Festival post caused chaos in the group, named \""Local News Now 2...(Marshall and all surrounding Counties).\""\n\nIn another post, which garnered over 100 comments of confusion and worry, a different member urged the woman to report the threat to the police.\n\n\""This isn't something to joke about or take lightly,\"" she wrote.\n\nThe author of the original post did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nENTITY's policy is to remove language that \""incites or facilitates serious violence,\"" the company spokeswoman said, adding that it did not remove the post and that it did not violate ENTITY's policies because there \""was no threat, praise or support of violence.\""\n\nCheryl Siddall, the founder of the Indiana group, said she would welcome tools from ENTITY to give her greater \""control\"" over what people post in the group, such as alerts to page moderators if posts contain certain words or phrases.\n\nBut Siddall said, \""I'm sorry, but that's a full-time job to sit and monitor everything that's going on in the page.\""\n\nPolice hunt for two armed with assault rifle in fatal shooting in Washington DC\n\nA ENTITY spokeswoman said page administrators have the ability to remove a post if it violates the group's proprietary rules and that administrators can pre-approve individual posts, as well as turn on post approvals for individual group members.\n\nIn a post to its blog, ENTITY urged administrators to write \""great group rules\"" to \""set the tone for your group and help prevent member conflict,\"" as well as \""provide a feeling of safety for group members.\""\n\nDavid Bacon, chief of police for the Plymouth Police Department in Marshall County, said the threat was investigated and traced back to an exaggerated rumor from children. Nonetheless, he said the post to the ENTITY group is \""what caused the whole problem.\""\n\n\""One post grows and people see it, and they take it as the gospel when in actuality you can throw anything you want out there,\"" Bacon said."

This is nothing more than a partisan witch hunt, sabotage, and I'm sure they're going to say, 'totally unsubstantiated.'\""\n\nTrump laid out a classic smorgasbord dealing with individual issues but the big picture was that Republicans represented the American people, American family and of course the American dream.\n\nHe lashed out scathingly about how Dems are stoking corruption and socialism in the power corridors of Washington DC. Patriotism and nationalism had strong underpinnings in his speech as he argued vehemently to \""take back our country\"".\n\nHe averred that it was time to end the endless wars giving examples of how US troops were in Syria for a decade while they have been in Afghanistan for 19 years. It was time to bring them home, he said.\n\nIn an emotional pitch, he added that it was hardest to sign letters to the families of the departed soldiers. Trump claimed that US has done its job, having defeated whoever they had to -- I do not want to stay in Syria.\n\nMaster of changing goal posts, Trump wanted Nancy Pelosi to help pass legislation rather than talk nonsense. The president is back as he returns to the hurly burly of campaign politics.\n\n(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

The said funds had been transferred by Religare Finvest to OSPL Infradeal without any approval and the entire documentation was done retrospectively three months after the actual transfer of funds.\n\nSimilarly, a corporate loan of Rs 50 crore was granted by Religare Finvest to another entity Bharat Road Network, which is related to the erstwhile promoters, without approval or documentation.\n\nLoans worth Rs 1,260.9 crore given by Religare Finvest to various entities were found to have allegedly landed in bank accounts of entities related to the Singh brothers.\n\nThe amounts are much smaller, but the modus operandi of alleged siphoning money from Fortis Healthcare, another company promoted by Singh brothers, is eerily similar. Here to SEBI asked Fortis Healthcare to recover Rs 403 crore with interest. Fortis Healthcare is now owned by Malaysia's IHH Healthcare.\n\nAfter their exit, the boards of REL and Religare Finvest were re-constituted with new directors. Singh brothers hold less than a percent in REL and they were reclassified as public shareholders from promoters.\n\nAll of this had nearly destroyed REL. As of March 31, Religare Finvest has made provisions on its entire corporate loan book of Rs 2,037 crore. The company suffered a loss of Rs 1,500 crore in FY19.\n\nUnder the new management the company has been trying to raise capital at the group and subsidiary level, which includes sale of its assets. It made some headway in July when it entered into a binding term sheet with TCG Advisory Services for sale of its entire stake in Religare Finvest and the latter's housing finance subsidiary: Religare Housing Development Finance Corporation (RHDFC).\n\nConsummation of the deal may take time given the regulatory hurdles. Meanwhile, the company has managed to service its liabilities. But given the challenging operating environment, how long it will do so is a big question.\n\nAlso, getting monies back from Singh brothers is a challenge.\n\nREL has already initiated recovery proceedings through a corporate insolvency resolution process under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016 against Singh brothers and their entities."

Ranbaxy,1,"If Handke's victory caused uncomfortable ripples, the choice of Tokarczuk was welcomed by liberal-minded authors\n\nNobel Prizes for literature were awarded Thursday to two writers enmeshed in Europe's social and political fault lines: a liberal Pole who has irked her country's conservative government and an Austrian accused by many liberals of being an apologist for Serbian war crimes.\n\nThe rare double announcement - with the 2018 prize going to Poland's Olga Tokarczuk and the 2019 award to Austria's Peter Handke - came after no literature prize was awarded last year due to sex abuse allegations that rocked the Swedish Academy, which awards the literature prize.\n\nYet if prize organizers hoped to get through this year's awards without controversy, they will likely be disappointed.\n\nThe Swedish Academy called Handke \one of the most influential writers in Europe\"" and praised his work for exploring \""the periphery and the specificity of human experience.\""\n\nBut the 76-year-old author has long faced criticism for his vigorous defense of the Serbs during the 1990s wars that devastated the Balkans as Yugoslavia disintegrated. He spoke at the 2006 funeral of former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, who at the time was facing war crimes charges, calling him \""a rather tragic man.\""\n\nHandke - who once called for the Nobel Prize to be abolished - said he was \""astonished\"" to receive the literature award.\n\n\""I never thought they would choose me,\"" Handke told reporters outside his home in suburban Paris.\n\n\""It was very courageous by the Swedish academy, this kind of decision,\"" he added. \""These are good people.\""\n\nIf Handke's victory caused uncomfortable ripples, the choice of Tokarczuk was welcomed by liberal-minded authors and readers in her native Poland and beyond.\n\nThe 57-year-old novelist, known for her humanist themes and playful, subversive streak, has often irked Poland's populists and conservatives. The academy said she was chosen for works that explore the \""crossing of boundaries as a form of life.\""\n\nAlready a major cultural figure in Poland, Tokarczuk has a growing international profile, especially since she won the Booker International prize in 2018 for the novel \""Flights.\""\n\nShe told Polish broadcaster TVN on Thursday that she was \""terribly happy and proud\"" that her novels, which describe events in small towns in Poland \""can be read as universal and can be important for people around the world.\""\n\nHandke has been a big name in European literature for decades, crafting works - starting with his first novel, \""The Hornets,\"" in 1966 - that combine introspection and a provocative streak. One early play was called \""Offending the Audience\"" and featured actors insulting theatergoers.\n\nHe has written screenplays, several of them for German director Wim Wenders, who also filmed Handke's 1970 novel, \""The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick.\""\n\nHe was praised by the Swedish Academy for writing powerfully about catastrophe, notably in \""A Sorrow Beyond Dreams,\"" his 1972 autobiographical novel about his mother's suicide.\n\nBut his staunch support of the Serbs during the 1990s Balkans wars has set him at odds with many other Western intellectuals.\n\nIn a 1996 essay, \""Justice for Serbia,\"" Handke accused Western news media of always depicting Serbs as aggressors. He denied that genocide was committed when Bosnian Serb troops massacred some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys in the enclave of Srebrenica in 1995, and was an opponent of NATO's airstrikes against Serbia for that country's violent crackdown in Kosovo in the late 1990s. In an interview with Serbia's state TV earlier this year, Handke said those behind the bombing \""don't belong to Europe and the planet Earth.\""\n\nHandke's views led novelist Salman Rushdie in 1999 to call him a contender for \""International Moron of the Year.\"" Rushdie's publicist at Penguin Random House said Thursday that Rushdie stood by what he wrote in 1999.\n\nNovelist Jennifer Egan, president of PEN America, said the writers' group deeply regretted the choice of Handke.\n\n\""We are dumbfounded by the selection of a writer who has used his public voice to undercut historical truth and offer public succor to perpetrators of genocide,\"" she said. \""At a moment of rising nationalism, autocratic leadership, and widespread disinformation around the world, the literary community deserves better than this.\""\n\nIn 2006, Handke turned down the Heinrich Heine award from the German city of Duesseldorf after his selection sparked a row among the city's politicians. His selection as winner of the International Ibsen Award for drama in 2014 also prompted protests from human rights groups.\n\nThat same year, he told the Austrian Press Agency that the Nobel Prize should be abolished because of its \""false canonization\"" of literature.\n\nSerbian officials and media hailed Handke on Thursday as a \""great friend of Serbia,\"" but Kosovans reacted angrily to his Nobel Prize. Vlora Citaku, Kosovo's ambassador to the United States, tweeted that \""In a world full of brilliant writers, the Nobel committee chooses to reward a propagator of ethnic hatred & violence. Something has gone terribly wrong!\""\n\nAlbanian Foreign Minister Gent Cakaj, who was born in Kosovo, tweeted that the award was \""an ignoble & shameful act.\""\n\nIn contrast, the win by Tokarczuk - Poland's fifth Nobel literature laureate - was greeted with praise even by her erstwhile critics.\n\nTokarcuzk has been attacked by Polish conservatives - and received death threats - for criticizing aspects of the country's past, including its episodes of anti-Semitism. She is also a strong critic of Poland's current right-wing government.\n\nHer 2014 novel \""The Books of Jacob\"" tackles the forced conversion of Polish Jews to Catholicism in the 18th century. Her book \""Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead\"" is a crime thriller with feminist and animal-rights themes that offers a sometimes unflattering depiction of small-town Polish life.\n\nCulture Minister Piotr Glinski, who said earlier this week that he has not finished any of Tokarczuk's books, tweeted his congratulations and said he now felt obliged to go back and read her books all the way through.\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda called it a \""great day for Polish literature.\""\n\nTokarczuk is only the 15th woman to win the Nobel literature prize in more than a century. Of the 11 Nobels awarded so far this week, all the other laureates have been men.\n\nBoth literature winners will receive a full cash prize, valued this year at 9 million kronor ($918,000), a gold medal and a diploma at a ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10.\n\nThe literature prize was canceled last year after an exodus of members from the exclusive Swedish Academy following sex abuse allegations. Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of a former academy member, was convicted last year of two rapes in 2011.\n\nThe Nobel Foundation had warned that another group would award the literature prize if the academy didn't improve its tarnished image, but said in March it was satisfied the Swedish Academy had revamped itself and restored trust.\n\nThe 2018 and 2019 awards were chosen by the Swedish Academy's Nobel Committee, a new body made up of four academy members and five \""external specialists.\"" Nobel organizers say the committee suggests two names that then must be approved by the Swedish Academy. It's unclear whether academy members simply rubber-stamped the experts' choice.\n\nThe literature awards follow Nobel Prizes in physics, chemistry and medicine handed out earlier this week. The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday and the economics award on Monday.\n\nALSO READ | 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to Austrian author Peter Handke\n\nALSO READ | A year late, 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to Polish author Olga Tokarczuk\n\nALSO READ | Two Nobel Prizes in Literature were announced this year.

Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""WASHINGTON: Ahead of the annual Blueberry Festival in Marshall County, Indiana, in early September, a woman broadcast a warning to her neighbors on Facebook.\n\n\""I just heard there's supposed to be a mass shooting tonight at the fireworks,\"" the woman, whose name is held to protect her privacy, said in a post in a private Facebook Group with over 5,000 members.\n\n\""Probably just a rumor or kids trying to scare people, but everyone keep their eyes open,\"" she said in the post, which was later deleted.\n\nThere was no shooting at the Blueberry Festival that night, and the local police said there was no threat.\n\nBut the post sparked fear in the community, with some group members canceling their plans to attend, and shows the power of rumors in Facebook Groups, which are often private or closed to outsiders. Groups allow community members to quickly spread information, and possibly misinformation, to users who trust the word of their neighbors.\n\nThese groups and other private features, rather than public feeds, are \""the future\"" of social media, Facebook Chief Executive ENTITY said in April, revealing their importance to Facebook's business model.\n\nThe threat of misinformation spreading rapidly in Groups shows a potential vulnerability in a key part of the company's growth strategy. It could push Facebook to invest in expensive human content monitoring at the risk of limiting the ability to post in real-time, a central benefit of Groups and Facebook in general that has attracted millions of users to the platform.\n\nWhen asked if Facebook takes accountability for situations like the one in Indiana, a company spokeswoman said it is committed to maintaining groups as a safe place, and that it encourages people to contact law enforcement if they see a potential threat.\n\nFacebook Groups can also serve as a tool for connecting social communities around the world, such as ethnic groups, university alumni and hobbyists.\n\nFacebook's WhatsApp messaging platform faced similar but more serious problems in 2018 after false messages about child abductors led to mass beatings of more than a dozen people in India, some of whom have died. WhatsApp later limited message forwards and began labeling forwarded messages to quell the risk of fake news.\n\nFIREWORKS FEAR\n\nThe Blueberry Festival post caused chaos in the group, named \""Local News Now 2...(Marshall and all surrounding Counties).\""\n\nIn another post, which garnered over 100 comments of confusion and worry, a different member urged the woman to report the threat to the police.\n\n\""This isn't something to joke about or take lightly,\"" she wrote.\n\nThe author of the original post did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nFacebook's policy is to remove language that \""incites or facilitates serious violence,\"" the company spokeswoman said, adding that it did not remove the post and that it did not violate Facebook's policies because there \""was no threat, praise or support of violence.\""\n\nCheryl Siddall, the founder of the Indiana group, said she would welcome tools from Facebook to give her greater \""control\"" over what people post in the group, such as alerts to page moderators if posts contain certain words or phrases.\n\nBut Siddall said, \""I'm sorry, but that's a full-time job to sit and monitor everything that's going on in the page.\""\n\nPolice hunt for two armed with assault rifle in fatal shooting in Washington DC\n\nA Facebook spokeswoman said page administrators have the ability to remove a post if it violates the group's proprietary rules and that administrators can pre-approve individual posts, as well as turn on post approvals for individual group members.\n\nIn a post to its blog, Facebook urged administrators to write \""great group rules\"" to \""set the tone for your group and help prevent member conflict,\"" as well as \""provide a feeling of safety for group members.\""\n\nDavid Bacon, chief of police for the Plymouth Police Department in Marshall County, said the threat was investigated and traced back to an exaggerated rumor from children. Nonetheless, he said the post to the Facebook group is \""what caused the whole problem.\""\n\n\""One post grows and people see it, and they take it as the gospel when in actuality you can throw anything you want out there,\"" Bacon said."
Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""The results are in. The Trump tax cuts resulted in most families saving so little that majorities continue to insist they see no difference in their paychecks.

Both Sanders and Warren are proposing not just significantly increased taxes on wealth, but crackdowns on big-money influence in politics and big-businesses power over all of us. On Monday morning alone, Sanders, still off the campaign trail while he recovers from a heart attack he suffered last week, called for banning all corporate contributions to funding the Democratic National Convention and presidential inauguration events, while limiting individual donations to $500 for the latter. As Sanders pointed out, Facebook and a number of other companies gave more than $1 million to the party's 2016 convention.\n\nAs for Trump's 2017 inauguration, it smashed records at $106 million. Also Monday morning, Warren released a plan to end financial conflicts of interest among the judiciary, a complement to other proposals to crack down on corporate lobbying and overall government and business corruption. Both senators have said they will crack down on private equity and break up Facebook.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, short-term shareholder value became the be-all and end-all, something that almost certainly not so coincidentally befitted the people in charge, who received the bulk of their ever increasing pay in that form. (Yes, Sanders has a plan to fight that, too.) That money allowed them an ever greater influence in our culture, economy and politics, celebrated as people of unique genius and insight. It's a selfish, shortsighted way of thinking but one that's been ascendant for the better part of 40 years. The result? Those Trump tax cuts.\n\nWhile it's understandable that someone with few or no dollars to spare will ponder which candidate is better for their personal finances, it's reprehensible that this is the position of these wealthy whiners. They'll be fine with less in their bank accounts or even one or two fewer zeros off their net worth statement. They can afford to think about the moral and long-range implications of their choice. What should concern them is a would-be strongman in the White House. Unstable, boastful, erratic ignorant rulers are not a sign of a country climbing to greater heights but of one descending to ever deeper depths.\n\nBe the first to know - Sign up for News Alerts\n\nWe'll send breaking news and news alerts to your inbox as they happen!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""Facebook CEO ENTITY will appear before Congress this month as the tech giant is under pressure from lawmakers and regulators over its massive market power and record of privacy breaches.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, the California Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee, announced Wednesday that Mr. Zuckerberg will testify at a hearing by the panel on Oct. 23. The focus will be on Facebook's plan to create a digital currency and its role in housing. The company agreed in a legal settlement in March to overhaul its ad-targeting systems to prevent discrimination in housing, credit, and employment ads.\n\nLawmakers from both parties and top regulators, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, have criticized Facebook's plan for the new currency, expressing concern that it could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking. There also is concern that the massive reserve created with money used to buy the new currency, to be called Libra, could supplant the Fed and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.\n\n\""Mark looks forward to testifying before the House Financial Services Committee and responding to lawmakers' questions,\"" Facebook said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nIn July, Ms. Waters and other committee Democrats sent a letter to Facebook requesting a halt on moving forward with the currency and with the digital wallet, called Calibra, which would be used in the new currency system. House Democrats also have threatened legislation that would block big tech companies from getting into banking.\n\nMs. Waters has called Libra \""a new Swiss-based financial system\"" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.\n\nFrance's finance minister said Wednesday that the European Union should not allow Facebook to develop the currency project on \""European territory\"" because it threatens the monetary sovereignty of member countries. \""It should not be the role of a private company to try to get a sovereign currency like a sovereign state,\"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.\n\nUnlike digital currencies such as bitcoin or Ethereum, Facebook's plan calls for Libra to be backed by real currencies.\n\nDavid Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, told lawmakers over two days of congressional hearings in July that Facebook would not launch the currency project until it had received all the necessary approvals from regulators and secured safeguards to protect the privacy of users' data. He said Facebook will not control Libra because Facebook will be only one of about 100 companies and nonprofits in an association that will manage the currency.\n\nThe plan would open low-cost online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts, and would make it cheaper to send money across borders, Mr. Marcus said. He did not agree to a suspension of the plan or a pilot project, as several lawmakers urged.\n\nFacebook, a social media giant based in Menlo Park, California, with nearly 2.5 billion users around the globe, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of data privacy scandals, including lapses in opening the personal data of millions of users to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nThe Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission, and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting investigations of Facebook and the other big tech companies amid accusations of abuse of their market power to crush competition.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg had three days of private meetings in Washington last month with Mr. Trump and several lawmakers who, like the president, are critics of the tech industry. He also met with the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee to discuss ways to prevent foreign actors from disrupting next year's elections. In a separate session, Mr. Zuckerberg told the leaders of the House Judiciary Committee that the company would cooperate with their antitrust investigation.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg last testified to Congress in the spring, when he was questioned about privacy, election interference, and other issues."
Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""Jesse Eisenberg and Alexander Skarsgård star in The Hummingbird Project.\n\nWith The Hummingbird Project, Canadian writer-director Kim Nguyen has created possibly the first stock market fraud thriller to be set predominantly in a rural environment. Nguyen, who was previously nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar for War Witch, assembles a relatively prestigious cast for a low-budget film of this nature, including Jesse Eisenberg, Alexander Skarsgård, Salma Hayek, and Better Call Saul's Michael Mando. The film concerns two Russian-American cousins, Vincent (Eisenberg) and Anton Zaleski (a heavily de-prettified Skarsgård) who work as ultra-high-speed commodities traders at a brokerage owned and run by Eva Torres (Hayek). Vincent decides to leave the brokerage to build a pipeline that will transfer trading data from Kansas to New York City within 16 milliseconds (the amount of time it takes a hummingbird to flap its wing), rather than the 17 milliseconds currently possible.\n\nHe believes that he will be able to get rich by having this technological advantage over other brokerages and enlists the technically more gifted but interpersonally less advanced Anton in his venture, convincing him to leave his job to join him in the venture also. The pair get funding for the pipeline from semi-corrupt financier Bryan Taylor (Frank Schorpion) and head out to Pennsylvania to oversee its construction, Anton concentrating on its coding and Vincent overseeing the project management with the assistance of engineer Mark Vega (Mando). However, they incur the wrath of Torres, who vows to wreck the project in retribution for what she sees as an act of betrayal by two employees who are using skills they developed under her tutelage to jeopardise her business and line their own pockets.\n\nWhilst the film is akin to films like Wall Street, The Wolf of Wall Street, and Margin Call in generic terms, in terms of narrative and character development, it is more like Bullitt, Dirty Harry, or one of Michael Mann's cop thrillers. This is because it portrays characters who are so resolute and single-minded in terms of their dedication to accomplishment of a professional goal(s) that a terrible toll is exacted upon their personal lives and personal relationships. Eisenberg brings the same sort of borderline psychopathic geekery to his character that he brought to his performance as Facebook founder ENTITY in David Fincher's The Social Network. Skarsgård is cast effectively against type as a nebbishy, bullied, possibly autistic coding genius, and Hayek is effective as a ruthless businesswoman.\n\nNguyen directs at a pace that keeps the viewer engaged, with Quebec and Ontario doubling for the Pennsylvanian countryside credibly. He manages to generate unexpected humour from Anton's personality traits and the starkness of the film's setting reflects the ever-diminishing likelihood of him and Vincent achieving the gargantuan, unreachable goal they have set for themselves. The film is not as entertaining as The Wolf of Wall Street, as dramatic as Wall Street, or as funny as The Big Short, but it does convincingly depict the conflicts between the over-arching ambitions of a Type A personality and the introverted technical genius of a Type B personality that manipulation of the financial markets can entail. The Hummingbird Project is available to download and stream now."
Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""It can be hard to remember from this side of a successful foreign intervention in a US presidential election, but in April 2016, ENTITY was widely praised when he spoke out - however obliquely - against Donald Trump's then longshot presidential candidacy.\n\n\""I'm starting to see people and nations turning inward against this idea of a connected world,\"" the Facebook chief executive said in a speech. \""I hear fearful voices talking about building walls ... It takes courage to choose hope over fear.\""\n\nThree and a half years later, another US presidential campaign is well under way and courage is not exactly thick on the ground at Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park. For the past few weeks, the company has been embroiled in a slow-motion scandal over its inexplicable policies on political misinformation, one that epitomizes the kind of moral cowardice that characterizes Facebook's approach to its political challenges.\n\nThe controversy kicked off last month when the Facebook executive Nick Clegg revealed in a speech that politicians are exempt from the company's third-party fact-checking program. The policy drew immediate scrutiny due to the distinctly dystopian context in which the speech was made: just as the president of the United States was actively promoting misinformation on Facebook to smear a political rival and undermine an impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump's Facebook page has launched 5,883 different ads since news of the Ukraine-call whistleblower broke on 18 September, 40% of which mention impeachment, according to a Guardian analysis of the Facebook political ad archive. The Trump campaign has spent between $1.3m and $3.8m promoting the impeachment ads, which had been viewed between 26.5m and 43.9m times, as of Wednesday. (The ad archive reports spending and impression data as a range.)\n\nMost of the ads employ the Trump campaign's usual brand of rhetoric: railing against the Democratic \""witch-hunt\"" and \""fake news\"" media; singling out non-white politicians for attacks (the Texas congressman Al Green is referred to in one set as \""Low-IQ\""); and encouraging a sense of grievance while seeking donations (\""They want to take YOUR VOTE away\"").\n\nBut one of the ads has caused particular concern because it is blatantly misleading. The 30-second video falsely claims that Joe Biden \""promised Ukraine a billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son's company\"". It uses audio of Biden speaking loosely of his role in Barack Obama's foreign policy - \""If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money,\"" he says, \""Well, son of a bitch, he got fired\"" - to create the impression that Biden admitted to extorting Ukraine on behalf of his son. CNN declined to run the ad, saying: \""In addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.\""\n\nFacebook's insistence on protecting Trump's right to mislead the public and distort verifiable facts is a strange look for a company that attempted to burnish its reputation post-Russian interference with an ad campaign declaring \""Fake news is not your friend\"". And attempts by the company to justify the decision are nearly impossible to parse.\n\nIn a letter to the Biden campaign, which complained about the Trump ad, Facebook's elections policy director, Katie Harbath, invoked \""Facebook's fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is\"". She then explained that if a politician shared a link to a viral hoax written by someone else, that post would be rejected as an advertisement, but if the same politician wrote the viral hoax in his own words, that would not only be fine, but Facebook would not allow third-party fact checkers to flag the information as false.\n\nWhen I asked Facebook whether this new rule would also exempt politicians who promote vaccine misinformation, which is explicitly barred from advertisements, a company spokeswoman said that it would not. If your head is spinning, you are not alone. These rules do not make any sense.\n\nWhat's even more absurd is that Facebook actually did take action against the ads, just for a different reason. As I reported on 2 October, the Biden ads were briefly blocked for violating Facebook's policy against profanity. (After the Trump campaign bleeped \""son of a bitch\"", they were allowed to run again.)\n\nWhy does Facebook's fundamental belief in free expression privilege the right of a politician to lie but not to use a swear word?\n\nIt has been tempting for some to ascribe Facebook's motives here to economic self-interest. The Trump campaign is a major advertiser on Facebook, after all, much larger than the Biden campaign.\n\nBut I suspect that this incident has less to do with revenues and more to do with Zuckerberg's fundamental political programming, which defaults to protecting incumbent power above all else.\n\nWas it really an act of \""courage\"" for Zuckerberg to criticize Trump's xenophobia in April 2016, when a Hillary Clinton coronation appeared assured?\n\nOver and over again, Zuckerberg and Facebook have failed to take action to prevent real and lasting harm, when that action involved challenging the status quo or state power. This was demonstrated most devastatingly by its unwillingness to rein in Myanmar's military until after a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya had already been accomplished, as well as in its foot-dragging on banning white nationalism. This predilection for the powerful is how Zuckerberg went from calling out Trump on building walls to an Oval Office grip and grin.\n\nWe are living in an age when everyone from cheap furniture makers to video game publishers is being forced to pick sides in serious struggles between business and barbarism, between authoritarianism and democracy. That Zuckerberg refuses to do so reveals whose side he's really on.\n\nWelcome to Dispatches from Silicon Valley, a new weekly column from me, Guardian US technology reporter Julia Carrie Wong.

Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.)\n\nChris Orban, The Ohio State University\n\n(THE CONVERSATION) In 2013, a who's who of the tech world came together to launch a newnonprofit called Code.org. The purpose of the organization was to get more computer science into schools.\n\nBillionaires like ENTITY and Bill Gatesdonated millions of dollars to the group. According to the organization's last annual report, Code.org spent more than US$91 million between 2013 and 2018. Of that amount, $6.9 million went to advocate for state legislation across the country.\n\nAs part of the organization's mission to \""make computer science count\"" in K-12 education, code.org takes credit for having influenced graduation policies in 42 states. Today, 47 states and the District of Columbia allow computer science classes to count in place of math classes like Algebra 2. Prior to the organization's work, only a few states allowed computer science to count for math credit.\n\nIn addition, 29 states passed legislation allowing computer science to count in place of a science course. When computer science begins to count as math or science, it makes sense to ask if these changes are helping America's students or hurting them.\n\nIs this a good idea?\n\nAs a computational physicist and education researcher who teaches college freshman introductory physics, I worry that allowing computer science to count as a required math or science course could make students substantially less prepared for college. I searched around for research on this topic and asked several colleagues but came up empty-handed. I also worry that a lack of math and science preparation in high school could artificially narrow the range of options for students who might otherwise have promising STEM careers.\n\nCertainly, computer science is important to teach in high school. I lead an effort called the STEMcoding Project where I have trained a few dozen high school math and science teachers to integrate coding into math and science, and I have worked with a few high school computer science teachers to integrate more science and math into their curriculum.\n\nI began working on the STEMcoding Project in 2016 after getting frustrated by how many undergrads and even graduate students came to my office wanting to be mentored on a computational physics research projects despite having no prior experience with programming.\n\nWhen I consider computer science in schools, I want to know: What kind of computer science, how rigorous is the content, and what ends up being removed to make room for it? Although there areexceptions, most high school computer science curricula that I have seen have been light on math and science.\n\nI worry that students may take computer science just to avoid the more difficult math and science courses they need for college. Computer science could be a way for students to circumvent graduation requirements while adults look the other way.\n\nOthers are concerned, too. In response to these trends, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics called in 2016 and as recently as 2018 for math classes to count as math only when they are \""designed explicitly to teach mathematics.\""\n\nCareer preparation\n\nComputer science can be a practical class that helps prepare students for real middle-class jobs. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis expressed similar ideas when he signed a workforce education bill into law earlier this year that allows computer science to count as math or science.\n\n\""Other than trying to keep my kids from falling down the stairs in the Governor's mansion I don't know how much I deal with physics daily,\"" the governor said. But he said it's different when it comes to computer science. \""You cannot live in our modern society without dealing with technology or computers in your daily life,\"" he added.\n\n× You have run out of free stories.

Despite a surge in the number of students taking computer science in college, there is still far more demand for computer science and software engineering workers than there is supply.\n\nPerhaps because of this demand the salaries for computer science jobs are estimated to beas much as 40% more than jobs in other fields.\n\nAre important math skills lost?\n\nDespite these arguments there are still good reasons to question computer science substitution policies like the one deSantis signed. Being a modern electrician, for example, requires some understanding of algebra and trigonometry.\n\nEven for those who plan to study computer science, taking Algebra 2 and above is highly recommended. Algebra 2 and other advanced math courses are also important for engineering.\n\nSome studies estimate that a remarkable 40% of college freshmen in the U.S. require remedial math courses. That portion could go up if fewer students are taking a traditional math sequence in high school.\n\nTaking remedial math courses like Algebra 2 in college requires students to spend more time and money than they would if they just took and passed four years of math in high school. According to one study, only about half of all students who take remedial math ever complete it. So skipping Algebra 2 in high school could end up stopping many students from graduating from college at all.\n\nA matter of choice\n\nPerhaps in weighing these concerns, of the 47 states that do allow computer science to count in place of math, 13 leave it to individual districts to decide whether to let students exercise that option. The list of 13 includes tech savvy states like New York and California.\n\nIn a majority of U.S. states, students and families now have a serious choice to make. Students can take a nontraditional route and replace courses like Algebra 2 and physics with computer science, taking their chances that this won't come back to bite them later. Or they can stick with a more traditional curriculum, with its traditional advantages and disadvantages.\n\nAs computer science substitution policies become more widely utilized, I plan to research whether or not these CS substitution policies help more than they hurt.\n\nWe especially need to understand how this flexibility affects women and students from underrepresented groups. Computer science advocates have created a kind of national experiment. The next few years will show if this was a good idea, but only if we're looking at more than just the numbers of students taking computer science.\n\n[ Like what you've read? Want more?

Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""It's our third Vergecast of the week, and it's time to recap what happened in the tech world. First up, Silicon Valley editor Casey Newton starts the show by explaining what we heard candidly from Facebook CEO ENTITY in leaked audio of an internal Facebook Q&A. The Vergecast explains what Zuckerberg's comments say about Facebook's unique place in the antitrust debate.\n\nNext, Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Paul Miller run through everything that was announced at Microsoft's Surface event this week, including some new foldable devices and Microsoft's partnership with Android. Will the folding form factor stand the test of time?\n\nWe've also got updates on the fight for net neutrality. An appeals court this week upheld the Federal Communications Commission's repeal of net neutrality laws, but it vacated a rule that would prevent states from passing their own versions of the laws. You can hear Nilay colorfully explain this court ruling on this episode.\n\nThere's a whole lot in between all of that -- including Paul Miller's weekly segment \""I've seen The Matrix. I'm not an idiot.\"" -- so listen through to get it all."
Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""A keen understanding of the way our brain functions is essential to building sustainable routines and habits that set us up for success, says Jay Kumar Hariharan.\n\n'Preventing decision fatigue is also one of the reasons past President Barack Obama and ENTITY do not change their wardrobe often,' says Photograph: Jim Young/Reuters\n\nBuilding a leadership brand is probably the most important investment a C-Suite member needs to make.\n\nBeing on top of your functional capability is the bare minimum and will get you a ticket, but for you to get some skin in the game when the air gets thinner and the competition fiercer, branding is the only way that will set you apart.\n\nTrue personal branding starts within and gets communicated outward.\n\nLike all great brands, great leaders are great learners; they are constantly learning about themselves, their environment and their interaction with the external environment.\n\nThey consistently work on understanding more about their leadership style and ensure they are communicating with clarity what their leadership style is about.\n\nAs a fundamental premise, branding seeks to establish and occupy a distinct place in our minds for a product or service. As leaders, we have an opportunity to positively affect lives and influence stakeholders with our unique style and personal branding is what will set us up to influence and succeed. Constant engagement using direct conversations, humility, powerful questioning and enquiry, will help us be more aware of our needs, values, norms and beliefs as leaders.\n\nThis sense of awareness helps us to craft meaningful interactions with our stakeholders.\n\nMilestones on the journey to reinventing your leadership brand\n\nA man with a strong why can handle any how: Nietsche\n\nStart with why.\n\nStarting with why is a great strategy.\n\nWhy do you need to reinvent yourself? What would you want the future 'You' to be?\n\nHow will this change help you reach your goals? What do these changes mean to you?\n\nHow will they add to the richness of your life?\n\nAdd as many references as possible to answer the question 'Why'.\n\nThink of each reference as one string -- the more strings you weave together, the stronger and clearer the new avatar.\n\nNeuroplasticity is the fascinating thing that happens in your brain every time you practice or think of something.\n\nNeurons get bonded together, like the string getting strengthened.\n\nEveryone stands in awe of what is rightly called the 'three-pound universe', with its 100 billion nerve cells that form anywhere between a trillion to quadrillion connections (synapses). These connections are in a constant state of shape-shifting and remodeling, sections of the brain being physically changed by adding neural threads.\n\nThe posterior hippocampus, the area of the brain known to be important for memory, is bigger in London taxi drivers than in most people.\n\nThe examination to be a London cabby is possibly the most difficult test in the world, demanding years of study to memorize the city's labyrinth of 25,000 streets, and the businesses and landmarks on them. Of course, Google maps has rendered this practice non-essential, just like we are rapidly losing our ability to handle complex numbers in our head.\n\nBring to the surface all those niggling observations about your own quirks, mindsets etc, and expose them to sunlight to answer your Big Why question. You will get an answer that may constantly evolve and that's alright. But answering the Big Why is fundamental to this journey.\n\nWhy are chocolates sold at supermarket checkout counters?\n\nWhat can we learn from Barack Obama and ENTITY's sartorial choices?\n\nLet us step into Neuroscience to understand how the brain interprets data.\n\nThere are two operating systems in the brain -- the rational, conscious part of the brain that evolved later, as part of the neo cortex, and the reptilian or limbic brain, a remnant of our prehistoric past.\n\nWhile the rational brain has always been considered the main protagonist, the real hero or villain, as the case may be, is the limbic or reptilean brain. This operating system adopts shortcuts to understand something faster, which is why symbols, metaphors and acronyms work harder.\n\nThere is something unique about the brain. It weighs about 2% of our body weight, but consumes 20% of our energy. Sense and decision-making consumes a lot of energy. And when you are low on energy, your body immediately craves for a sugar hit.\n\nWhen you are in the supermarket, walking down the aisles, you are making decisions. There are at least 60 brands of toilet paper and 125 brands of bottled water in the US alone. This is one of the reasons chocolates are sold at the counter.\n\nTo give you the sugar fix you need.\n\nPreventing decision fatigue is also one of the reasons past President Barack Obama and ENTITY do not change their wardrobe often, and I quote Obama here: \""I have many decisions to make. I can't squander that energy in figuring out my wardrobe or breakfast.\""\n\nFor example, if we hear about a con man taking advantage of a kind elderly widow, we might feel disgust. But the disgust doesn't come from a special moral centre; instead, our outrage happens in the insula, the same part of the brain that handles disgust about rotten food and faeces.\n\nSo evolution 'retrofitted' the insula to do a much wider range of functions than it originally did, including allowing us to experience moral disgust.\n\nMany of our complicated moral and psychological responses have their roots in basic parts of the brain. As a consequence, the literal and the metaphorical happen in the same place.\n\nSapolsky shares some examples: In a remarkable study, ChenBo Zhong of the University of Toronto, and Katie Liljenquist of NorthwesternUniversity, demonstrated how the brain has trouble distinguishing between being a dirty scoundrel and being in need of a bath.\n\nVolunteers were asked to recall either a moral or immoral act in their past. Afterward, as a token of appreciation, Zhong and Liljenquist offered the volunteers a choice between the gift of a pencil or a package of antiseptic wipes. And the folks who had just wallowed in their ethical failures went for the wipes.\n\nIn the next study, volunteers were told to recall an immoral act they had committed.\n\nAfterward, subjects either did or did not have the opportunity to clean their hands. Those who were able to wash were less likely to respond to a request for help (set up by the experimenters).\n\nLady Macbeth washing her hands also seems to support this.\n\nTrue leaders develop a deep understanding of themselves to begin with and then an understanding of how they are perceived.\n\nWhen I coach CXOs, I hear them say things like, 'I am perceived to be a hard taskmaster who doesn't empathize with my subordinates, but that's not who I am. That is just perception.'\n\nWell, if three people say you snort like a horse, do buy a saddle!\n\nLeadership is a contact sport and perception is reality. Your stakeholders are drawing a picture based on all the emotions you trigger in them, to slot you as a particular brand of leader and this thin slicing is instantaneous.\n\n***\n\nA recent study showed that individuals will pair names such as 'Molly' with round silhouettes, and names such as 'Kate' with sharp silhouettes.\n\nMoreover, individuals associate different personality traits with either group of names (e.g. easy going with 'round names'; determination with 'sharp names'), suggesting influencers in abstract concepts.\n\nRamachandran and Hubbard suggest the Kiki/Bouba effect has implications in the evolution of language, because it suggests that names are not arbitrary.\n\nI use this as an exercise with my coaches, and they too, intuitively say answer in the same way, landing in the 95%. Then there is also an 'aha' moment when I ask them what they think their leadership style?\n\nKiki or Bouba? This helps them understand the deeprootedness of perception.\n\nLet's borrow a thought from Prahlad Kakkar, who posed this question while speaking at a conference: \""Who is the first brand manager you met in your life?\""\n\nPeople started yelling out names. After a moment he gently suggested their parents had been their first brand managers.\n\nIt began when they named their babies Vikram, Ajay, Sweetie...whatever the case.\n\nThis quote from Maya Angelou rings true not just for its warmth and simplicity, but also because it is moored in Neuroscience: \""I've learned that people will forget what you said; people will forget what you did; but people will never forget how you made them feel.\""\n\nEach time we engage in a different behaviour, we are accessing a part of the brain and neural strands are getting together to elicit a certain reward in a cycle of Cue-Routine-Reward.\n\nOver time, the neural strands thicken and we can access the same emotional state easily, which is why a careful scan for triggers and cues from the external environment is essential in our war against bad habits.\n\nA keen understanding of the way our brain functions is essential to building sustainable routines and habits that set us up for success, mapping our paths as successful leaders in the work place, and as human beings in the larger world.\n\nExcerpted from Rewire: How To Be The Leader Of Your Own Life by Jay Kumar Hariharan with the kind permission of the publishers, Leadstart."
Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""Next Tuesday, ENTITY will take the stage to give his annual opening keynote address at Facebook's F8 developer conference. In the wake of months of privacy- and security-related controversies that culminated in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it will be one of the most important public appearances of his life.\n\nThe same was said about Zuckerberg's appearances earlier this month on Capitol Hill. But while the senators and representatives who grilled him for 10 hours have the power to regulate Facebook-though no consensus on a solution-next week's talk will let Zuckerberg directly address the developers in the room as well as users, investors, and others following his speech from afar. So the stakes, as Facebook aims to navigate the winding fjords of potential regulation, jittery shareholders, and the #DeleteFacebook movement could hardly be higher.\n\nTraditionally, of course, F8 is a Facebook lovefest, with Zuckerberg and a conga line of other executives taking the keynote stage to unveil one new product, feature, or technology after another. Last year, for example, the company rolled out an augmented-reality camera system, new social VR features, music and games in Messenger, new Messenger bot features, professional-quality VR cameras, and even a futuristic approach to hearing through skin.\n\nFacebook will certainly make numerous product and feature announcements this year. But they will likely be smaller and more measured. Big reveals like the company's rumored smart speakers are surely being delayed, as will be any other major products or features that remind people of the myriad ways Facebook keeps track of their personal data and actions.\n\nThat's not to say that the two-day event, held at the San Jose Convention Center, won't be packed with important information for the thousands of developers who are the lifeblood of Facebook's external ecosystem. Indeed, this year's event is touted as \""biggest F8 to date,\"" with a schedule offering 84 sessions on everything from \""What's New with News Feed\"" to \""Updates to Facebook App Ads\"" to \""Messenger for Businesses,\"" and everything in between.\n\nAnd imagine how packed the house will be at the \""Security at Facebook Scale\"" talk by chief security officer (for now) Alex Stamos. \""You've heard that Facebook is investing heavily in security and safety in 2018,\"" the official session guide reads. \""Come learn how we approach security to protect our community and company.\"" After all, nobody has a bigger interest in whether or not Facebook can get it right on security and privacy than the thousands of developers who build third-party tools on its infrastructure.\n\nFacebook's community of third-party developers has a giant investment in the future of the company's many platforms-including Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Oculus. And those developers have little choice but to persevere regardless of whether or not Zuckerberg, COO Sheryl Sandberg, or vice president Andrew Bosworth are being pilloried in the media or Facebook's stock is plummeting and costing tens of billions of dollars of market cap loss. (At the moment, Wall Street is once again happy with the company after its stellar first-quarter earnings report earlier this week -- its stock price is now within striking distance of where it was pre-Cambridge Analytica.)"
Mark Zuckerberg,0,"""Facebook's much-rumored move into cryptocurrency is official. On Tuesday, the Facebook-led Libra Association introduced itself and its mission to the public. This alliance of financial and tech titans will function as an independent not-for-profit organization headquartered in Geneva, responsible for overseeing the development and governance of a new blockchain built for payments. The group aims to create a cryptocurrency that is stable, scalable, and compliant, and designed for a mass consumer market that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have not yet served -- including consumers in countries where even having a bank account at all is not the norm.\n\nLibra's 28 founding members include some of the world's biggest brands; humanitarian organizations focused on financial inclusion; an impressive brain trust that includes bitcoin pioneers Mickey Malka and Wences Casares, Coinbase's Emilie Choi, A-list venture capitalists Katie Haun, Fred Wilson, and Josh Kushner; and crypto startups funded by investors Naval Ravikant, Max Levchin, and Elad Gil; and even a nonprofit backed by Israeli-Russian billionaire Yuri Milner that is searching for extraterrestrial life.\n\nBy category, the 28 members include:\n\nMarketplaces: Facebook, eBay, Farfetch, Mercado Pago, Lyft, Uber, Spotify, Booking Holdings (Priceline, Kayak)\n\nPayments: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Naspers/PayU, Stripe\n\nTelecommunications: Vodafone, Iliad\n\nBlockchain: Coinbase, Xapo, Anchorage, Bison Trails\n\nVenture capital: Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, Thrive Capital, Ribbit Capital, Breakthrough Initiatives\n\nNonprofits: Kiva, Women's World Banking, Mercy Corps, Creative Destruction Lab\n\nNoticeably absent are tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Square. Also among the missing: Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange owned by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, best known for their battle with ENTITY over the ownership of Facebook.\n\nAt a press briefing at Facebook, Dante Dispartes, head of policy and communications for the Libra Association, told me that the organization is still looking for additional members. It aims to have 100 members contribute a minimum of $10 million apiece in Libra tokens by the time the cryptocurrency launches in early 2020. That billion-dollar goal will fund the operating costs of the association and an incentive program for acquisition of merchants and customers. As each member is responsible for running a node that validates transactions on the blockchain, the association has set a high bar to join. Among the criteria is whether a company has $1 billion in market value, a reach of over 20 million users globally, and/or recognition by a notable trade association or media outlet as a leader in its field.\n\nLibra expects to use the money it raises from its token sale not only to cover the operating costs of the association but also to fund merchant and wallet incentives, some of which could be in the form of discounts for people who use the currency as a form of payment. No details on such deals are yet available. (There have been rumors that Lyft and Uber might offer a price break to people who pay with Libra.)"
Guptas,1,"Members of South Africa's controversial Gupta family have long been implicated in a series of corrupt political connections and illegal deals that have earned them millions, often in government funds. The influence of the family, now reportedly in exile in Dubai, is so all-pervasive that the affair is widely known as the \state capture scandal.\""\n\nOCCRP has previously reported how Gupta-linked firms and operators extracted money from a state transport infrastructure company, profited from a corrupt locomotive tender, exploited a compliant bank, and emptied part of a pension fund for state workers using insider information.\n\nThe total amount of money allegedly stolen by the ENTITY and their associates reaches into the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWhat's been largely unreported is what happened to this money after it was safely out of the reach of the state.\n\nThe matter is much more than an intellectual exercise. After the country's high court recently ordered Trillian, an investment firm at the centre of the ENTITY' web, to repay R595m unlawfully taken from the state electricity company, it emerged that the money was no longer in the firm's accounts.\n\nNow, having exclusively obtained a Trillian server containing more than three million documents, including memos, invoices, and internal emails, OCCRP has been able to piece together where at least a portion of the ENTITY' millions went between 2014 and 2017.\n\nUnder Trillian's direction, the money was cycled through a network of 10 shell companies and consulting firms that held accounts at South African and international banks. The money, which also passed through a Bermudan group of companies, ended up as far afield as India and Dubai.\n\nIntra-company and shareholder loans appeared to be a key mechanism for the laundering of the money, which in some cases was repeatedly moved from firm to firm, obfuscating its origin.\n\nThe new findings account for how the ENTITY acquired a large portion of their fortune, mainly through inflated contracts with state-owned entities such as Eskom, the state electricity provider. South Africa's High Court has ruled that the deals were illegal. The R595m sought by the court, and paid to Trillian in tranches, are among the newly revealed transactions.\n\nExclusive new emails\n\nThough Trillian is difficult to link to the ENTITY directly - the family is known to work through trusted associates - exclusive, newly revealed emails appear to show one \""R P Gupta\"" communicating personally about the deals. The name may refer to Rajesh Gupta, the youngest of the brothers.\n\nIn addition to sending millions to offshore firms, Trillian appears to have spent or laundered even more through various other schemes, including paying exorbitant service fees to consultants. By working with KF Investments, a Johannesburg-based investment firm, Trillian even managed to buy and hold shares in major global businesses including Woolworths Holdings and British American Tobacco.\n\nREAD: As Eskom asks Interpol for help, leaks shed light on how Gupta-linked firm may have moved millions\n\nThe ENTITY' dealings were aided by other businesses. Stein Scop Attorneys, a Johannesburg-based law firm located near Trillian's high-priced offices, was the attorney of choice and record for most of the deals. The firm received over R100m from Trillian and held it in trust accounts.\n\nThe centre of the web\n\nTrillian, an unassuming investment firm once headquartered in Johannesburg's swanky Melrose Arch neighborhood, is the key instrument of the ENTITY' dealings. Spun out of Regiments, another key piece of the empire that featured heavily in earlier reporting about the ENTITY, the firm took over the company's trade in securities.\n\nTrillian oversaw the network of consultancies and shell firms that helped the ENTITY shift their gains. According to documents found on the company's server, it was both the sender and the recipient of the key transactions, which include millions from Eskom and other sources:\n\n* Trillian received $41m from Eskom, the state electricity firm, in illegal contracts. This theft has been widely reported and is now the subject of a judgment by the High Court. New documents reveal that over R300m of this money was paid into the accounts of nine firms overseen by Trillian and controlled by the ENTITY. Millions were then recycled back to Trillian to help disguise the money's origin. A further R205m was paid out to Trillian's Bank of Baroda account in South Africa and another company in the group, Trillian Shared Services. The remainder was directly paid out to Gupta lieutenants.\n\n* Trillian received just over half a billion rand ($30m) in loans from three firms controlled by Gupta associates: Centaur, Cutting Edge, and Albatime. In all three cases, the loans may not have been intended to be repaid, and may represent the laundering of funds initially sent to these firms by Trillian itself. Part of the money originated from a separate Eskom payment revealed in a previous OCCRP investigation. The remainder came from other public entities such as Transnet, a state-owned transportation company.\n\nIn addition to cycling money it had received from state entities, the records show that Trillian also moved tens of millions of dollars acquired by other companies in the ENTITY' network in a series of financial transactions that may have been intended to launder the money. The company's CFO, Tebogo Leballo, did not respond to questions. Rajesh 'Tony' Gupta and Atul Gupta could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe trader and the enforcer\n\nTrillian and the network of shell companies it oversaw was the brainchild of two key Gupta associates: Eric Wood, a stock trader and former director of Regiments Capital, and Salim Essa, the man who would link the family to key political players. The company was created in 2015, and the two men's relationship is widely thought to date from that year.\n\nREAD: Gordhan: Over R2.1bn recovered in overcoming the 'rot' of state capture\n\nHowever, documents newly obtained from the Trillian server show that Wood and Essa first linked up at least three years earlier. In a September 2012 email to Essa with the subject line \""project scoping,\"" Wood outlined how, working together, the two men could win business deals worth R775m over a period of two months - September to November 2012 - from state companies, including Denel and Transnet (Eskom, the ENTITY' biggest financial heist, was not yet listed). The message, which is clearly part of a larger discussion, reveals that Wood and Essa - who was acting on behalf of the ENTITY - were already discussing the public entities that they later exploited.\n\nIn 2013, Essa's company, Elgasolve, formally became Regiments' business development partner. The firms would be involved in a series of destructive deals with state entities which amassed large profits for Essa, Gupta associate Kuben Moodley - and the ENTITY - who appeared to receive half of the profits.\n\nThough comfortable with the existing relationship, Regiments' other directors declined Elgasolve's subsequent offer to purchase 50% of the company. But, unlike his Regiments colleagues, Wood was eager to deepen his ties to the family.\n\nBy spring of 2015, he and Essa co-founded Trillian with the aim of creating a vehicle that would enable them to keep all the state money for themselves. According to an affidavit seen by reporters, the plan was to run the company only until 2019 - a period intended to correspond to Jacob Zuma's term in office. The president and his political allies were key to making the ENTITY' state capture possible.\n\nThe early exit of Zuma from office ended Wood and Essa's deals sooner than expected - but not without hundreds of million of dollars under their belt.\n\nWood did not respond to phone calls or to questions sent by email. Essa could not be reached.\n\nCentaur's false loans\n\nIn his doctoral thesis submitted to South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand, Wood made a blunt case for an aggressive style of moneymaking. He argued that the key to success as a trader is to make high-risk investments - and not to count on having a long career. In other words: Haul in the money - and fast.\n\nIn his thesis, Wood listed a Bermuda-based company, Centaur Asset Management, as an example of a financial service provider.\n\nBut Centaur was not just any company. It was part of a group of companies conceived by the ENTITY which received tens of millions of dollars from Trillian - and then agreed to \""loan\"" R400m back to the trader on September 1, 2016. To build a legitimate-looking paper trail for the operation, Trillian entered into an agreement to provide financial advisory services to Centaur, which was ostensibly a mining company.\n\nIn fact, according to leaked documents from the Bank of Baroda, where the accounts involved in this transaction were held, this operation represented part of the millions the ENTITY had taken from Eskom, as well as other income from state companies, such as Transnet. The money was cycled through these loans, which made no business sense unless they were designed to disguise its origins.\n\nAfter arriving back in Trillian's hands, the money was then sent on to Cutting Edge Commerce, a South African company co-owned by the ENTITY.\n\nThough there is no document showing that the ENTITY owned Centaur themselves, a wealth of evidence points to the fact that it is their creation.\n\nAccording to Trillian documents obtained by OCCRP, the Centaur group consists of at least seven Bermuda-based entities and one South African company - most of them created in 2014. The ENTITY were copied in emails relating to the companies' activities.\n\nREAD: Popo Molefe: 'fight back' campaign by those unseated by state capture revelations\n\nBut they were run by proxies: An Indian citizen named Akash Garg, who married into the Gupta family, and a Dubai-based U.K. citizen named Daniel McGowan.\n\nGarg's move to South Africa with his family was actively assisted by the ENTITY. Visa requests relating to the move were found in emails sent and received by Ashu Chawla, an employee of Rajesh \""Tony\"" Gupta - a Gupta brother whom Garg referred to as \""mamaji,\"" an Indian term of respect. The visa requests were addressed to the South African government on the letterhead of Sahara, another Gupta company. (Garg and Chawla could not be reached for comment.)\n\nWhen he registered two of the Centaur companies, McGowan listed their addresses as an apartment in Dubai's famous Burj Khalifa tower. Emails on the Trillian server show that Tony Gupta sought to purchase an apartment in the same building, presumably for Duduzane Zuma, the son of the deposed president.\n\nMcGowan's email address at Centaur was cc'd on exchanges between Tony Gupta and Salim Essa involving the apartment. According to a realtor also included in the exchanges, the papers would be sorted by the time Duduzane arrived.\n\nMcGowan's communications with Essa and the ENTITY also show their efforts to make Centaur look like a legitimate investment firm.\n\nIn a 2014 email, for instance, McGowan writes that the company needed to hold roughly $8 million in its account to show that it had capital. This money, he wrote, \""could be paid to Centaur for a day [,] we could then issue the proof of funds directly and return the money the same day.\""\n\nInvoices found on the Trillian server reveal the mechanism the ENTITY used to siphon over half a billion rand from Eskom. This is the $41m now sought by the High Court.\n\nThe first step was for Eskom to send the money to Trillian. The first payment was made precisely one day after Eskom approved Trillian as a registered supplier, raising the question of how any work done could have been assessed within 24 hours. Trillian acknowledged in its own internal documents that the company lacked credentials and the necessary skills.\n\nAfter arriving in Trillian's accounts, large portions of the Eskom money quickly disappeared into a set of consultancies and shell companies. For example, after receiving over R235m from Eskom in August 2016, Trillian sent on a full R221m within five days.\n\nTwo of the companies that received this money were Gupta-linked consultancies Cutting Edge and eGateway. They received the money after invoicing Trillian for work they had allegedly done for Eskom. Explanatory notes such as \""data analysis,\"" \""cost saving initiatives,\"" and \""technical services\"" - with no further contracts or any additional details - point to the fact that the work was, in fact, fictitious. In total, Cutting Edge and eGateway - which was described by Trillian as housing \""some of the best skills in the world\"" - received almost R204m from the state utility.\""\n\nREAD: Eskom to study High Court orders on Trillian deals\n\nCutting Edge and eGateway were able to receive payment from Eskom for their \""work\"" because Trillian had joined an Eskom contract that global consulting giant McKinsey had already won.\n\nMcKinsey flagged its new South African partner as a risk due to Essa's presence and sought to distance itself by denying any relationship. However, it had little choice but to accept the situation - thanks in part to Eskom's head at the time, Anoj Singh, who travelled on the Gupta's bill to Dubai. (Meanwhile, according to Trillian's own internal investigation - the Budlender Report - the Minister of Public Enterprises Lynne Brown denied at the time that Trillian had been paid by Eskom).\n\neGateway's relationship with Trillian also reveals, for the first time, direct involvement by one of the Gupta brothers in the network's questionable financial operations. The company's email address, egateway@gmail.com, was overseen by someone who signed his emails as \""R P Gupta.\"" The youngest Gupta brother is named Rajesh Gupta (though he often goes by Tony).\n\nEmails show that correspondents considered this account to be important. In one email from July 2016, R P Gupta sends a short note of praise to a Trillian employee, thanking him for work, which he describes as \""highly appreciated by Escom [sic] and Trillian.\""\n\nIn response, Trillian's employee is obsequious, referring to R P Gupta as \""Respected Sir\"" and emphasising that he will do what is needed.\n\nThe ENTITY' two consultancies, Cutting Edge and eGateway, received over a third of Eskom's $41m.\n\nAccording to bank transfers found in the Trillian data, as well as invoices justifying some of these transfers, another large portion - over R100m, or about $7.5m - was sent to six shell companies based in South Africa. One of them, Pactrade, is not known to have issued any invoices.\n\nThough these firms appeared to be independent of Trillian, they showed few signs of functioning businesses.\n\nThree of them - Medjoul, Fortime, and Birsaa - listed the same registration address, shared the same director, and collectively deregistered in the same month: August 2017. In addition to receiving money from Eskom, they appear to have been used to receive other illicit payments from state companies: The Trillian data include invoices they filed to Transnet, Denel, SA Express and others.\n\nFour other shells - Jacsha, Shacob, Matson and Pactrade - also shared common directors, and some shared the same addresses. Multiple invoices citing Eskom were filed by these companies in August 2016 (though Pactrade's were not among the data). These were part of a vague \""Commission Agreement\"" with Trillian allowing them to bill up to 50 percent for introductions to new clients and business opportunities.\n\nThe shell companies' South African bank accounts were held at Standard Bank, ABSA and First National Bank, among others.\n\nIt is difficult to know just much the shell companies received due to the volume of Eskom cash shuffled between different entities. Documents on the Trillian server show that, between August 13 and 15, 2016, the company made payments of several million dollars in Eskom money to its shell companies. It also paid R205m to Trillian Capital Partners' account at the Bank of Baroda and Trillian Shared Services' account at First National Bank.\n\nThese accounts transferred still more back to the Gupta-linked shell companies. For example, on August 18, 2016, Trillian Shared Services transferred close to R15m of their Eskom take to Fortime, Medjoul, and Birsaa and R45m to another Essa-linked company, Zestilor. On the previous day, August 17, Trillian had agreed to pay Zestilor R200m ($14.8m) for their services, according to a document signed by Trillian's CFO, Tebogo Leballo.\n\nMoreover, as soon as Eskom sent the funds to Trillian's account at the Bank of Baroda, Trillian asked the bank to send R75m back. These funds may also have been intended for Zestilor. On August 18, Leballo instructed Trillian to make a payment of R75m ($5.6m) to Zestilor, adding that he \""would provide details later.\"" On August 31, Ashok Narayan sent more than a dozen invoices to Leballo, which showed that funds paid to shell companies including Fortime and Birsaa were payments \""to cover the R75m to Zestilor,\"" or $5.6m.\n\nThe following year, Trillian carried out an internal review of Zestilor that showed that Sahara, a Gupta-owned company, was Zestilor's only client. Emails from 2015 obtained by OCCRP show that Zestilor's First National Bank account was aided by employees of Gupta-owned Sahara. For example, Santoush Choubey, a Sahara employee, sent an email to Salim Essa, with a copy to Tony Gupta, that showed he had knowledge of Zestilor's financial and ownership structures. The email addressed Essa as \""dear sir.\""\n\nThese transactions are an important find because that Bank of Baroda account is known to be controlled by the ENTITY and was also used by the family's other shell companies.\n\nIn late 2015, as South African banks started to shut down Gupta accounts, Trillian began to open more accounts at foreign banks. In the minutes of a November 2016 meeting obtained by OCCRP, Wood said Trillian needed to \""mitigate the risk of our other accounts being unfairly frozen\"" by maintaining accounts in South African rand at the Dubai branch of Pakistan's Habib Bank and India's state-owned Bank of Baroda. Yet by 2017, South African banks like ABSA and FNB continued to bank Trillian. Wood's reference to the account closures appeared to reference the Gupta experience and not Trillian's.\n\nOther large payments from Trillian's ABSA account - and using the same Eskom money - were made to the Gupta-linked Albatime, as well as to Essa and Wood (through his company Numibrite). The Gupta lieutenants appeared to profit handsomely from the arrangement.\n\nYou've got mail\n\nAdditional email correspondence from the Trillian server demonstrates another link to the ENTITY.\n\nThe shell companies that handled the money appeared to be overseen by a single email address: wallemsa@gmail.com. In one instance, the owner of this account asked for payments with the all-caps demand \""PLEASE CONFIRM ONCE PAYMENT IS DONE\"" - without attaching an invoice.\n\nAccording to the records, the handler of this account, who was often simply referred to as \""A,\"" was Ashok Narayan, at the time an employee of the ENTITY' first company in South Africa, Sahara Systems (Narayan could not be reached for comment.)\n\nEven before Trillian was created, some Regiments employees appeared already to know that Narayan handled shell companies for the ENTITY that took an even split of profits from government contracts. A late 2015 email from a Regiments employee to Narayan read, \""Hi Ashok, See attached the schedule for the allocation of the payment that was done on Friday to both Fortime and Birsaa.\"" The attachment described a 50-50 split for money that had been received from state companies.\n\nThrough their employee, Narayan, the ENTITY kept a close watch over Regiments, the emails show.\n\nIn July 2015, for instance, Wood forwarded him notice of a R14.2m payment from Transnet to Regiments. In another email, Wood shared with Narayan his correspondence with Anoj Singh, the former head of Eskom, in which he advocated for Regiments to receive \""market related compensation\"" for work done. Narayan, in turn, reported information to Essa, whom he referred to with respect as \""bhai.\""\n\nNarayan is better known for his role in Homix, a company previously reported to have received oceans of cash from Regiments - but never before definitively linked to Essa. A May 2014 draft company agreement found on the Trillian server shows Homix being appointed as a \""strategic technical service provider\"" to Regiments with the goal of producing \""business opportunity.\"" The document's properties show that Essa modified it as soon as it was created, showing that he was involved. By 2015, one honest employee worried by media reports asked Wood, in an email titled \""Homix and Anoj Singh,\"" \""we have paid [Homix] 200m+ in the last financial year... Can you tell me the nature of our relationship with Homix?\""\n\nWood did not respond. Singh could not be reached for comment.\n\nStein scop are excellent\n\nWhen a Trillian employee did not know who was behind the seven consultancy firms reaping hundreds of millions in Eskom money, he asked Stein Scop Attorneys - a law firm located a stone's throw from Trillian's offices in Melrose Arch. The firm reported that outside of directors like Ayub Vali Ali, an Indian national, the beneficial owners of the shell firms were unknown.\n\nStein Scop managed to become one of the biggest beneficiaries of Trillian's government work by charging the Gupta network hefty legal fees to the tune of millions of dollars. The firm spent months prosecuting Trillian whistleblower Mosilo Mothepu, staving off investigations into Trillian, and otherwise defending the firm.\n\nStein Scop's bank account held significant amounts of Trillian's money in trust for both specified and - largely - unspecified purposes. At least a portion of this amount could represent part of the stolen Eskom millions, since the transactions were made at about the same time.\n\nBut whether it was setting up agreements with companies like Centaur or overseeing a range of opaque projects nicknamed Fusion, E2E, Mumbai, and others, Stein Scop was always available for Trillian.\n\nStein Scop did not appear to have many clients outside of Trillian and Regiments, if a letter from their auditor is to be believed. The letter confirms that, for the year ending at the end of February 2016, Stein Scop did not generate more than R10m in annual revenue.\n\nWhen a Trillian employee sought a law firm to create and backdate a contract with Cutting Edge which had been receiving Eskom money, Trillian's chief financial officer responded, \""Please use Stein Scop, they have been excellent.\""\n\nStein Scop did not respond to specific questions about their work with Trillian, citing client confidentiality. They confirmed that they were one of several law firms to act on behalf of Trillian, but said they withdrew representation from the firm in 2017."

And it comes from one of the most high-profile groups in the space.\n\nHe says Europe is not quite there yet, but is one its way.\n\n\Europe has the potential to emerge as a global leader in blockchain technology...This is in part down to an openness towards innovative technologies, coupled with regulatory developments,\"" he told Sifted.\n\n\""Europe is [Coinbase's] biggest market outside of the U.S...We are currently operational in all 28 EEA countries and are always looking at options for expanding our presence whether that is through partnerships or acquisitions.\""\n\nTo illustrate this, below is an overview of Europe's late-stage ecosystem, including those who have raised - or have revenue - of ~£15m+.\n\nTo explain these categories further, please see below:\n\n\""Trading and Transfer\"" - This encompasses platforms where you can trade, store, or spend in crypto (or crypto derivatives). The leader, Bitstamp, is based in the UK while Bitpanda was born in Germany. Meanwhile, Finland's LocalBitcoins offers peer-to-peer bitcoin swaps around the world, and oversaw $187m in traded volume in August alone according to CryptoCompare. Note, while there is a widespread problem with crypto exchanges faking volumes, those listed are generally accepted to more established platforms.\n\n\""Custody\"" - Think of these as digital safes for crypto, with specialised tech that protects the assets against hacks, loss or theft.\n\n\""Wallet\"" - Similar to the above but online, rather than in the form of a physical USB-like key. That means it's easier to access in order to trade, but arguably less hack-proof that custodied assets.\n\n\""Crypto mining\"" - These lucrative companies run large, specialised computers which process the transactions on a given blockchain. Every time they \""mine\"" digital currencies like Bitcoin, they receive a fee. Most are based in countries with cool climates like Iceland, where Genesis has a base.\n\n\""Software\"" - This covers an eclectic group of companies building blockchain's \""revolutionary\"" promises, including reforming financial services. R3 has raised over $120m for the privilege while Nivaura is backed by the London Stock Exchange, but both have been riled by accusations of delays and over-promises.\n\nBeyond that, it's worth remembering that this list only just scratches the surface. Underpinning these companies are other smaller tech companies and specialised hedge funds and banks.\n\nStill, for all its progress, Europe has a particular obstacle: fresh funds.\n\n\""The only thing missing is access to capital. There are only a handful of European early-stage funds investing in crypto or blockchain,\"" says Brunet, who also runs the largest European crypto newsletter.\n\nIt's true. The pool of local, specialised VCs is essentialy limited to Fabric, Blueyard, Blockchain Ventures, Outlier and Libertus. In addition, the size of these funds pail in comparison to the US's biggest players, which includes Andreessen Horowitz's $300 million crypto arm and Pantera, which raised a $160m fund earlier this year.\n\nAnother issue is that countless European companies (and tokens) like Melonport don't survive; admittedly, a normal issue among startups. Part of the problem is the slow adoption of crypto, which has struggled to communicate its use-cases; fuelling 'fatigue' and disillusion in some spheres.\n\nStill, an unintended consequence of this 'fatigue' is the rise of \""anti-blockchain\"" European startups; firms which are based on the premise that blockchain's capabilities are overestimated.\n\nThey instead rely on alternative specialised technology, including London-based firm Thought Machine and Radix DLT, who reportedly turned down over $100m in investment capital and is backed by the co-founder of Transferwise."
Richard Branson,0,"EXTORTIONIST CATCHES'EXTORTIONIST' - BIRK OF BIRKBECK HELD IN NONG PLALAI PRISON - THAILAND\n\nBUT WHAT IS THE TRUTH BEHIND THE ARREST IN THAILAND OF FORMER SCHOOLMATE Of ENTITY, UNIVERSITY CHALLENGE WINNER, AND ARMY OFFICER, THOR HALLAND?\n\nIt made the Bangkok Post and the story did not quite sound right. It made the PattayaOne news site and the author who wrote it said he did not understand it either.\n\nWhy on earth is Thor Halland, a former stalwart of the Pattaya City Expats Club, now languishing in a Pattaya jail after trying to get 50,000 baht in goods seized and 15,000 by bank transfer out of a French halal food producer called Laurent Thierry , or Thierry Laurent.\n\nThis is hardly a Thai national newspaper story.\n\nWell it might be if they included that fact that Halland , was one of the Birks of Birkbeck, (Birkbeck College, University of London) which won the British television series 'University Challenge' in 2003 hosted by Jeremy Paxman, and who held a short-term commission in the British Army, and who had attended to Stow public school with ENTITY. (His partner in the alleged crime Denis Zabadoev is a boxer and performs locally.)\n\nBut the newspapers did not know that.\n\nI do not know Thor Halland but I know of him and have exchanged emails. But first here below is the story published by PattayaOne newspaper.\n\nPATTAYA: -- Chonburi Immigration Police announced on Thursday the arrest of a Russian and British National wanted in connection with a case of theft and extortion from March 2015.\n\nPolice Colonel Prapansak, the Superintendent of Chonburi Immigration, based in Jomtien, announced the arrest of Mr. Denis Zabodaev aged 31 from Russia and Mr. Thor Hallan (sic) aged 45, a long-time expat residing in Pattaya.\n\nBoth were arrested based on arrest warrant numbers 250/2558 and 251/2558 dated 19th May 2015 and issued by the Pattaya Provincial Court. They are accused of theft and extortion from Mr. Laurent Thery (Thierry) aged 51 from France who runs an import/export Halal Food Factory at the Egmongkol Village 4 Estate in Soi Kaotalo in East Pattaya.\n\nOn 26th March a group of 4 men are alleged to have entered his factory and removed assets totaling 50,000 Baht in value. Mr. Thery was then escorted to his apartment at the Royal Thai Residence in Soi 7 off the Thepprasit Road in Jomtien where a further 50,000 Baht's worth of assets were taken, including computers and phones. CCTV from the apartment complex was obtained by Police who will submit this to court as part of their evidence against the two arrested men.\\n\nAnd here is the Bangkok Post report. Both newspapers demonstrate the willingness of newspapers in Thailand to publish whatever the police say without question even getting the names wrong.\n\nWhy was this matter handled by immigration police? And why on a charge involving 10,000 baht of goods seized plus 15,000 baht by bank transfer (total about £2,200) was Halland denied bail?\n\nBesides Pattaya police do not as a rule investigate foreign crimes against foreigners.\n\nThat seems a bit unfair because the guy who reported to him was none other than Drew Walter Noyes, of One-Stop-Service-Center and he has been glowing all week about the news. Noyes' is to whom the Frenchman took his case.\n\nDrew Noyes, 59, is of course the businessman who last year convicted of extortion and jailed for 2 years. He is out on appeal on bail. He has only spent one night in detention - and the sums involved are much higher.\n\nHe was accused of attempting to extort the out of Thonglor Clinic initially out of 7 millon baht (£135,000+) later reduced to 2.3 million (£43,000). That was when he was publisher of the 'Pattaya Times' newspaper.\n\nWell the matter was handled by Immigration Police because Thor Halland, and presumably his alleged co-conspirator, did not turn up in court to face charges brought by the Frenchman. Hence a warrant was issued for his arrest.\n\n(It is possible that he did not know about the court cases I guess because Drew Noyes has managed to get the Pattaya Court to court issue writs which the accused do not ever receive and which can even be sent to hotels where the co-accused may have stayed once (Drew Noyes V Andrew Drummond and Alastair Cooper) or writs by public notice (which no foreigners would have a clue about finding). But that is conjecture)\n\nMuch more to the point is who is Thor Halland and what is his relationship with Drew Walter Noyes, the American who announced he had come to Thailand by Royal Proclamation and then set up beer bars in Pattaya?\n\nThor Halland, is a onetime property man, one time army officer, who settled in Pattaya many years ago. He was a big voice at the Pattaya City Expat Club which Drew Noyes claims he started - and he even wrote the Wikipedia entry for Pattaya and gave talks on the history of Thailand and even gave a talk to the Pattaya International Women's Club Club on Buddhism.\n\nHalland is regarded as a bit of a toff even taking part in a local theatre group and of course pub quizzes.\n\nHighly read in 2003 he had been on the winning University Challenge team from Birkbeck College, who were referred to as the 'Birks' because in a previous context they had achieved the lowest possible score.\n\nHalland studied Philosophy at Birkbeck College.\n\nHe was in fact part of the Drew Noyes faction at the Pattaya City Expats Club along with Andre Machielsen and they furiously defended Noyes who was beginning to come under attack from some members.\n\nThey also joined Noyes on an army day out and got the same Royal medals Noyes claims all over social media where Noyes taking to adding to his CV saying he was now trained as a skydiver and marksman.\n\nThey paid for them - 10,000 baht each - and one American participant said he had to pay Noyes 20,000 baht for the army camp day out.\n\nHalland also became a contributing food writer to Drew Noyes' now defunct Pattaya Times.\n\nThat was until members of the expats club discovered the truth.\n\nDrew Noyes was conning members by selling them condos in the Keha Condo scheme (above his office) which he had acquired from the Thai National Housing Authority who were granting subsidised loans.\n\nOf course these units were meant for poorer Thai people. But what the hell. There was money to be made - lots of it. And Noyes inflated the prices and sold them on at twice the price he paid.\n\nThis all turned very ugly and Drew was forced to hand cash back on threat of prosecution and when it came to voting for the club's first President Noyes was out on his ear.\n\nBut the Expat Club members were still not happy with Noyes and Blogger spots started appearing on the net describing Noyes, amongst other things of being a sociopath. What he certainly was not was the 'American lawyer' he claimed to be.\n\nBoth Andre Machielsen and Halland, whom Noyes suspected were behind it all then became the targets of Noyes incandescent rage and desire for revenge. He started blog sites accusing Halland of being a mental case and of Machielsen of being a drugs dealer and wanted by the police (Just as he did with yours truly).\n\nHe ingratiated himself with the judges at Pattaya Court by holding a 'legal seminar' promoted by ThaiVisa.com and dining with judges and having himself photographed with them on Thai Law Day - or Wan Rapee. (He even announced that together with the Chief Judge of Chonburi he was writing a book which would feature the libels of Andrew Drummond after I had started writing about his scams)\n\nThe judges of course were unaware that Noyes had already been exposed in the United States before coming to Thailand in particular by the Wilmington Star in North Carolina where he had turned up offering his realtor services.\n\nThe Star described him as a man of 'myriad lies' and highlighted his property frauds, share scams and even a case of sexual harassment where he is alleged to have demanded oral sex from a junior employee in return for him granting her more hours work. All this in a front and inside page article by Scott Gold, now with the Los Angeles Times, headed 'Trouble Follows Developer'.\n\nNor did they know he had been arrested for larceny and had been jailed and put on 36 months' probation or his court listings for assaults on women\n\nHe threatened to sue Halland and Halland paid 10 baht damages to Noyes on the understanding he would implicate Machielsen as the man who was writing about him. It was getting all very grubby as things generally do where Noyes is involved.\n\nNoyes has been seeking revenge ever since especially since he discovered that Halland was openly speaking out against him in letters to this site.\n\nBut that of course does not explain why Halland should be kicking around with boxer Denis Zabdeav.\n\nCOMMENT: Don't confuse this with an action by the Russian mafia in Pattaya though. But as we have already highlighted, Noyes, and his henchmen David Hanks and Brian Goodie DO have connections to the Russian mafia.\n\nHanks was arrested with a Russian godfather for racketeering and of course Noyes provided visa services to Russian and East European prostitutes to they could ply their trade in Pattaya- at least according to several young women who contacted this site. And that brings us around to Pattaya Immigration Police again."

Read on below to find out what Kutcher's net worth is and how he made much of his money.\n\nAshton Kutcher grew up in Iowa and went to college at the University of Iowa. While in college, he won a modeling contest and subsequently moved to New York to sign with modeling agency Next.\n\nKutcher had a relatively good modeling career in the late 1990s. He got to walk in several fashion weeks and even appeared in Calvin Klein commercials.\n\nHowever, Kutcher did not do modeling work for a long time. After a while, he decided to move to Los Angeles to pursue acting.\n\nIn 1998, Kutcher landed a role on That's 70's Show as Michael Kelso, a good-looking but immature young guy. The show became a huge hit and Kutcher also became a household name. He remained on That's 70's Show for its whole eight-season run, which ended in 2006.\n\nIn 2010, Kutcher co-founded A-Grade Investment to invest in technology start-ups. The firm started out by investing $30 million into companies such as Skype, FourSquare, Path, Uber, and Airbnb. In just six years, they turned the $30 million into $250 million.\n\nKutcher also co-founded another investment firm in 2015 called Sound Ventures. The firm is a successor to A-Grade Investment, and according to medium, Sound Ventures specializes \""in early stage to growth and late-stage venture investments.\""\n\nKutcher's investment work was recognized by other venture capitalists when he became a guest shark on Shark Tank in 2015.\n\nAshton currently has a net worth of $200 million, as reported by Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nIt has been said that Kutcher made around $200,000 and $280,000 per episode.

Richard Branson,0,"I recently read the book Dangerous Hero: Corbyn's Ruthless Plot For Power, by renowned investigative journalist Tom Bower. Bower has also written books on various people such as ENTITY, Rupert Murdoch, Robert Maxwell and Tony Blair, with varying degrees of deserved brutality. He now has turned his attention on the leader of Her Majesty's opposition.\n\nMuch of the book is not quite the trove of astonishing revelations that it might have appeared to be, if only because I had realised quite some time ago what Corbyn is and stands for, and read about his involvement in, and support for, hard-Left causes for quite some time. I knew about his support for Hamas, his attendance at a funeral of a killer of Israeli athletes (he initially lied about it), his outreach to Sinn Fein IRA within days of the Brighton bombing of 1984 (I was a student living in Brighton at the time, and it was when the name \Corbyn\"" first entered my consciousness), his holiday-making in the Soviet satellite states and so on. I knew much of this, and assume that most political junkies who follow UK affairs had a reasonably solid grasp of all this gruesome detail.\n\nWhat is nonetheless striking about this book is the way it shows that Corbyn's Marxism was quite possibly formed in a period when - never fully explained in his own accounts - he left Jamaica (in the late 60s) and had, so Bower speculates, gone to Cuba. Corbyn's hatred of the UK, and the empire it created, is very much at the core of his political credo. Corbyn is incurious in some ways about enterprise - other than loathing it, and has tended to leave the details of how a socialist state will direct our lives to colleagues such as John McDonnell. What really floats Corbyn's boat is his adversialism towards the UK and West as a whole. Any power and person whom he thinks has the ability to hurt the UK and the West as a whole gets his support, no matter how murderous or malevolent.\n\nThis anti-British, anti-Western stance is a coherent strand throughout. It explains Corbyn's cozying up to Iran (and willingness to appear on Iranian TV and get paid for this) - because he hates Israel (a pro-Western, broadly free nation); it explains, even his anti-semitism (Bowen is very clear about this; no sophistry about how Corbyn is anti-Zionist but not anti-semitic); it is the key to his hatred of the US and of course the UK. It shows why he has been a champion of the cause of a united Ireland, preferring to support the IRA, and attend the funerals of IRA operatives, rather than focus on the messier routes of democratic politics in Northern Ireland. And it also shows why he has more recently praised Venezuela, at least until its recent disasters, because that country was seen as being a pain in the bum for the US. To take another Latin American case, Corbyn was happy, it seems, for the Argentinian junta to invade the Falklands Islands, a UK territory, and never mind the democratic wishes of the island's locals.\n\nOne of the most useful parts of the book was its account, told with moments of unintended humour, of Corbyn's time as a Labour Party councillor in North London, and of how he worked to remove real/alleged enemies and take control. Bower also shows that while Corbyn obviously craved the approval and circle of senior hard-Left figures such as Tony Benn, he was no real intellectual himself and did not contribute original ideas. What Corbyn was very effective at - and Bower ruefully admits this - was being an organiser of protest. He also had a sort of rubber-ball quality - he seemed able to take all kinds of abuse and setbacks and keep ploughing on. He was and is also fairly immune to straightforward venality and corruption, one of his few positive traits. (That does not mean his views are less unpleasant, but as far as one can tell Corbyn was not motivated by money in the way that Tony Blair seems to have been.) It also seems that he is quite a red-blooded sort of bloke, but also not very easy to get on with for the long haul: three marriages as of the time of writing. Another nugget: One of his former wives said that she never saw him read a book during the time they were together.\n\nIt is sobering to think that Corbyn has learned nothing from the past half a century in any way that would affect his thinking away from socialism. The many disasters of socialist states have had no impact on his thinking. At all. The end of the Berlin Wall is, one suspects, a grave sadness to him, and people around him, such as media advisor and unashamed Stalinist, Seamus Milne. This fixity of ideological purpose makes me think that socialism really is, for some, a secular religion. The Bower book contains the nugget that John McDonnell, now shadow Chancellor, once thought of going into the priesthood.\n\nNow, a socialist might scoff and say that libertarians can become a bit dogmatic too (that is correct), but there's a big difference: a market-based economy has, through the processes of bankruptcy and profit, a feedback system in which bad, mistaken ideas fail, and good ones succeed. With socialism, by contrast, failure (such as the misallocation of resources in Soviet Russia) is taken to mean that the State must do even more socialism, that \""beatings will continue until morale improves\"", so to speak. The free market is like a sort of constant Karl Popper-style testing of hypotheses (business ideas). Socialism does not have any sort of equivalent process.\n\nWhat to explain how far Corbyn has come despite all this? Bower gives some idea about this. Corbyn is sly and enjoys letting others do the dirty work of knifing colleagues and betraying real/alleged enemies, and likes to appear above it all, and play the part of the scruffy, dotty-but-endearing Leftie with his vegetable patch and penchant for photographing street furniture. It is striking how even the joke tag \""Magic Marxist Grandpa\"" is almost an affectionate term, until you realise what Marxism will do. Corbyn shows you can get away with appalling, mistaken views if you speak softly, are bit of a \""character\"" and have good manners (although he can lose his temper when confronted in some cases). And finally, there is Corbyn's quality of patience. He's been working away, waiting for his chance. In 2015, when the former Labour leader, Ed Milliband stood down, the party's leadership/voting rules allowed a person such as Corbyn to stand. People voted to let his name go on the ballot. It is proof that random events can really make a difference. (Ironically, it rather undermines the Marxist idea that we are propelled deterministically by economic forces and relations of production.)\n\nThe book, however, for all its pace and verve, is unlikely to convert a lot of people away from Corbyn and what he stands for, although I suppose one or two people might be swayed. I do think that the anti-semitism must have rattled a few even more devoted fans, and his dithering over the EU issue is a delight to watch because Brexit is an issue that doesn't fall into any obvious map that Corbyn has in his head.\n\nAn issue with this book is that Bower has no references or footnotes, a fact that Bower justifies by saying that so much of what he was told was off the record, and that he took legal advice to that effect. The problem with no references is that it is easy therefore for some people to attack the veracity of some of his details. Peter Oborne, who like some right-wingers has a sort of madly odd affection for Corbyn, on the grounds that he is \""authenic\"" (I fail to see what is great about being an authentic nasty piece of work), has attacked the book's accuracy. Bower hasn't responded. I remember many years ago, when I wrote pamphlets for libertarian causes, that Brian Micklethwait and other old friends such as the late Chris Tame drummed into me the importance of references and sources, with lots of specific details, in the interests of good scholarship. If a book is going to drive a stake into the heart of Corbyn, I think it would have been more effective had it contained some explicit sources.\n\nDangerous Hero is a gripping read - I went through it very fast - and it is gruesome, even chilling, reading. It is a well-paced, angrily written account of the life of a man who, let's not forget, is still a potential prime minister of this country. As his IRA chums used to say, defenders of freedom have to be eternally vigilant, because for the likes of Corbyn, they need to be lucky just once."

Richard Branson,0,"""The small, standardized satellites known as \""Cubesats\"" have increased access to space -- many launches include caches of Cubesats along with the main payload. Those tiny satellites are all hanging out around Earth, but that could change soon. Virgin Orbit, the rocket-based spinoff of Virgin Galactic, has signed a deal with Polish satellite company SatRevolution to send the first commercial Cubesats to Mars in 2022.\n\nENTITY's Virgin Galactic aims to send people into space for a few minutes at a time using an unusual rocket-powered spaceplane. The company has been testing its designs for years, and it hasn't always gone as planned. Virgin Orbit takes a similarly unusual approach to reach space. The company's LauncherOne rocket won't ignite its engines on the ground. Instead, it will attach to a conventional Boeing 747 airplane that carries it to a high altitude. Releasing the rocket up there reduces fuel consumption and makes it cheaper to reach space.\n\nNASA's InSight lander is currently alone on Mars, but it made the trip to the red planet with company. A pair of Cubesats called Mars Cube One (MarCO A and MarCO B) traveled along with it as a proof of concept that Cubesats could operate on interplanetary missions. NASA lost contact with these satellites (as expected) several weeks after InSight landed, but the success of Mars Cube One has convinced SatRevolution and Virgin Orbit that such spacecraft can contribute to our understanding of other planets.\n\nSatRevolution, which is working with a consortium of Polish universities and companies, hasn't provided precise details on what it hopes to accomplish. Well, other than being able to pat itself on the back about being the first to send commercial Cubesats to Mars. It says that Cubesats could capture photos, measure radiation levels, and more. Presumably, the Cubesats will perform flybys of Mars like Mars Cube One. To enter orbit, they would need powerful engines to reduce speed.\n\nBefore the Cubesats can head for Mars, Virgin Orbit needs to finish work on the LauncherOne system. The 70-foot rocket has been loaded aboard Virgin Orbit's 747 carrier for \""captive carry\"" and drop tests, but it hasn't ignited its engines in the air yet. Virgin Orbit hopes to conduct its first orbital test by the end of 2019."
Richard Branson,0,"""What's a light-year? The same as a regular year, but with fewer calories. Just an example there of the mind-numbing ramblings with which we have had to amuse ourselves, seemingly for decades, while twiddling our thumbs waiting for the world's first spaceport to open for business. How and why is commercial space travel taking so long?\n\nLet's backtrack a little, shall we? The recent interstellar coverage of Emirati astronaut Hazzaa AlMansoori's epic journey revived a burning childhood curiosity: Are we, humble tourists, ever going to space en masse? Since Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon half-a-century ago, speculation has been rife about 'when' not 'if' we will be embarking on our own galaxy quests. TV shows over the years such as the various Star Trek series and Stargate SG-1, not to mention the criminally overlooked Space Precinct, only fuelled imaginations, yet the closest we came to extra-terrestrial excursions was an opportunity to hitch a ride on a Russian rocket for an exorbitant fee at the turn of the millennium (a chance American engineer Dennis Tito embraced in 2001 for the princely sum of $20 million). Then in 2004, much like the evolutionary sequence in 2001: A Space Odyssey, we made 'a giant leap'. Sir Richard Branson, he of Virgin Cola fame (among other endeavours), announced his latest venture -- to build and run a fleet of spaceships carrying guests into orbit for a fraction of the cost.\n\n\""Huzzah,\"" exclaimed astro-enthusiasts who are fond of an anachronistic phrase or two. Nevertheless, here we are, 15 years later and the flourishing industry envisaged way back when 'I Phone' was merely a verb and Janet Jackson's Super Bowl halftime show incident was what constituted a scandal still appears many parsecs in the distance.\n\nIs it though? What's going on? In a nutshell (or should that be tin capsule?) -- blasting a busload of sightseers out of the troposphere is difficult. It involves testing and certifications that don't even exist. They're making it up as they go along. Plus, the accounts, barring a few early ticket sales, only show money going out on research and development. Continual investment with no immediate return can be arduous to acquire. However, here comes the good news. This week, according to CNBC, aircraft manufacturer Boeing has bought a $20 million stake in Virgin Galactic. Further encouragement came from the report with the fact Branson's lot have flown people to space twice aboard their SpaceShipTwo suborbital space plane, VSS Unity, in December 2018 and February this year; plus the company is in \""the final stretch\"" of testing, says Virgin Galactic CEO George Thomas Whitesides and he \""still feels good about going into operation next year.\"" We've heard similar promising noises before, but such high profile bankrolling does raise the spirits for a 2020 lift-off. What do you think? Are we on a course to go 'where no one has gone before'? Will you be first aboard?

The state prisons department is making it the first in the country to comply with the guidelines of a European antitorture watchdog -- considered a benchmark in the humane treatment of prisoners -- to ensure that extraditions are processed quickly.\n\nA separate barrack will be earmarked for , which can lodge at least 25 inmates.\n\nFugitive economic offenders like ENTITY and have fought India's extradition appeal with the claims that prison conditions in the country are appalling and deplorable, and operate in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman treatment.\n\nThe prisons department sent a letter to the state government in the first week of September, stating that to approve extradition requests, foreign courts and governments often insist on an undertaking from the Indian government that the offender will be lodged in a prison that meets the standards prescribed by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT). In some cases, an independent agency is sent to cross-verify assurances made by the Centre when seeking extradition.\n\nThe CPT is a specialised monitoring body of the 47-member Council of Europe, comprising independent and impartial experts such as lawyers, medical doctors and specialists in prison or police matters. It is not part of the European Union, but the latter often refers to the CPT's observations and recommendations when drafting legal texts as well as during communication with member and non-member states.\n\nThe letter referred particularly to India's protracted extradition appeal for Mallya and Modi, who are currently in the UK, \""despite overwhelming evidence against them\"". \""Mehul Choksi, residing in Antigua and Barbuda, is another accused whose extradition is being sought by the Central Bureau of Investigation,\"" it stated.\n\nAs the first step towards compliance with the CTP's standards, a team from the prisons department may soon visit the UK to learn about prison conditions there. The state government has been requested to clear this visit at the earliest.\n\nIn Maharashtra, only barrack 12 in the crowded currently has the facilities to lodge VIP inmates, but it can't take in any more offenders. \""It has tighter security -- an officer and a guard are on duty round the clock -- and its two cells are monitored 24x7 from a control room.

The 2,124-capacity Taloja jail is not as crowded -- as of July, it had 2,227 inmates.\n\nIn September last year, London's Westminster court, which is reviewing Mallya's petition against his extradition, had asked for a \""step by step video\"" showing conditions at Arthur Road jail's barrack 12. After India submitted the video, the court expressed satisfaction with the evidence and said that there were no grounds to believe that he faces any risk at all in the jail."
Vijay Mallya,1,"The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police has issued a preventive alert at all airports across the country against the accused in the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank. The preventive alert has been sent across immigration and security counters of the airports so that the accused involved do not flee the country.\n\nIn the past, several accused in bank frauds have managed to flee the country while very little success has been attained on bringing them back to face the law. Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and ENTITY are some of the fugitives who borrowed huge loans and duped banks using some modus operandi or the other.\n\nOn Monday, as per the complaint of the RBI administrator, EOW registered a case against PMC Bank's Managing Director Joy Thomas, Chairman Wareyam Singh and HDIL Chairman Wadhawan. Several others on the PMC management were also named in the case.\n\nThe complaint was registered by the RBI administrator Jasbir Singh Mattha, who in his complaint against the accused alleged that in the period starting 2008 till August 2019, the loans issued to a particular company by the PMC bank were not paid and had turned into NPA (non-performing asset). But, the information was not disclosed to the RBI by the PMC Bank as per banking norms.\n\nAlso, the PMC Bank officials prepared fake loan accounts and records with lesser amounts and submitted it to the RBI, which led to a loss of Rs 4355.46 crores, the complaint said.\n\nThe primary beneficiary to the losses suffered by the bank was HDIL group of companies and bank officials, in connivance with HDIL officials, were involved in the loans being offered and disbursement despite non-payments on various occasions.\n\nThe loan amount borrowed from the PMC Bank was misused by the debtors for their personal purposes, leading to major losses to the bank.\n\nPMC Bank MD Joy Thomas, in a letter addressed to the chief manager of PMC Bank, confessed to having hidden the fact regarding NPAs by HDIL on loans borrowed from the bank and also regarding forging records and accounts in front of the board and the RBI. Thomas goes on to say in the letter dated September 21, that the cover-up was to protect the reputation of the bank.\n\nOn September 23, RBI officials placed PMC Bank under directions, citing irregularities in lending loans to some companies for six months. The PMC Chairman Wareyam Singh was on the board of HDIL between 2006 and 2015 and had then joined PMC Bank as director was later elected as chairman of the bank.\n\nThe account holders were shocked when they learned about the restrictions as the directions allowed them to only withdraw Rs 1,000 in six months from their accounts. Many were shattered and disturbed leading protests across the state at PMC branches. RBI later increased the withdrawal limit to Rs 10,000.\n\nThe case against PMC Bank officials and HDIL chairman has been registered under sections 409, 420, 465, 471, 120 (B) of IPC.

Vijay Mallya,1,"Mallya had raised questions over the conditions of Indian jails during the extradition trial against him.\n\nThe Maharashtra Police has written to the state government, demanding a team of officials to be sent to study prisons in foreign nations. This exercise is meant to help create prisons as per the global standards in order to build a stronger case against fugitives like ENTITY and Nirav Modi.\n\nAccording to India Today, the Maharashtra Police has already submitted a letter to the government in this regard, and it is likely to be accepted. The police department has sought permission to visit jails in the United Kingdom, other European countries, or Israel to see how economic offenders are kept there.\n\nThe team will include police officials as well as personnel from Jail and Home ministries. The visiting officials will study norms set by European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, commonly called CPT standards, which are followed in European prisons.

Virat Kohli,0,"India's pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and their ace all-rounder Hardik Pandya have apparently been ruled out of Bangladesh-India Test series in November as both of them are set to leave for the UK to consult specialists physicians following their 'back problem,' report Indian media outlets.\n\nNews agency IANS adds:\n\nWhile Bumrah has already been ruled out till the Bangladesh series in November, the team management doesn't wish to take any chance and want to consult the best.\n\nSpeaking to IANS, a senior board functionary confirmed the development and said that Bumrah will be in the UK for a week to consult the doctors and take the necessary steps.\n\n\""Yes, he will be going to the UK in the first week of October and will be accompanied by Ashish Kaushik. They will look to get the best possible opinion in the matter. They will be checking with three doctors and the next plan of action will be decided after that,\"" the functionary said.\n\nEarlier, speaking to IANS, sources in the team management had said that the Bangladesh series is not in the radar for Bumrah as skipper ENTITY and coach Ravi Shastri want him to recover completely and return to action as India also have an eye on the 2020 World T20 in Australia next year and the pacer will be a vital cog in the line-up.\n\n\""You can say that the team is looking at Bumrah's return for the West Indies limited-over series. But the team management is very clear that they want no shortcuts and undergoing a proper rehab and returning fully fit is vital. The Bangladesh series would be too early,\"" the source explained.\n\nThis means that Bumrah will have no role to play in India's campaign in the World Test Championship this year.\n\nWith an eye on the upcoming World T20, India will be majorly playing limited-over cricket this year with the three Tests against South Africa and the two Tests against Bangladesh post the SA series being their only games in the longer format this year.\n\nHardik Pandya is set to leave for UK on Wednesday as he will get his back checked by the same doctor who treated him during India's tour of England in 2018 and the 2019 World Cup. This will be his third visit to the UK specialist as Pandya aggravated his back during the T20I series against South Africa.\n\nSpeaking to IANS, a senior board functionary said that Pandya has been consulting the UK specialist for the back issue that he has been facing and the doctor will now sit down with the all-rounder and discuss if they will go in for a surgery or take medicines to help recover from the back problem.\n\n\""Pandya had tried his best and worked on his fitness after the World Cup. But he aggravated it while playing in the T20I series against South Africa. He is flying off tomorrow and will sit down with the specialist and decide if he needs a surgery or medication will do.\n\n\""The specialist understands him as they have been in touch over the last couple of years. In fact, even when we were playing the World Cup, he paid a visit to the doctor to get his back checked. You have to understand that no athlete at the top level is a 100 per cent. They are always carrying some niggle or the other. The physio is there to help in that. But then, after a point, you need to take a call,\"" the functionary said.\n\nIn fact, he even cited the example of M.S. Dhoni and how he has always slept on the floor as he has a bad back. \""Take Dhoni's example. For the last 12 years, he has been sleeping on the floor and playing non-stop. You try and figure out ways to tackle situations because at the end of the day, nobody wants to be going under the knife,\"" the functionary said.\n\nAsked about Bumrah's situation, the functionary said: \""He is progressing well as his body is on auto-heal mode, but we don't wish to take any chance and that is why he is being sent to the UK for assessment. But things are looking much brighter. In fact, for those unaware, this was his second stress fracture as he healed automatically the first time."

Virat Kohli,0,"10 years, that's the recurring theme in Pakistan cricket these days. A decade is a very long time in any field. Stars blossom and fade away in lesser time periods. With little more concerted effort, this theme can be translated into an ever-lasting, beautiful narrative, controlled by cricket. Without Pakistan, cricket will never be complete. To start with, on Monday, the 'international cricket,' the One-Day Internationals to be precise, returned to Pakistan. That can be read as the first chapter.\n\nLive Scorecard | Cricket News | Photos\n\nLast time the 1992 World Champions hosted an international series was way back in the Noughties, against the same opponents. Though, there was another series in between, in 2015 against Zimbabwe. But not many thought it was worthy of giving much thought, considering obvious reasons. By the way, they won it 2-1, but lost the preceding series, against Sri Lanka 1-2 with the visitors winning the finale at Lahore, where three Twenty20 Internationals will be played between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the next seven days. With so little international cricket happening in Pakistan, it is sometimes necessary to hark back to action-filled days, which will give a sense of continuity.\n\nAnd here's how it has continued, after a ten-year break. The first one got rained off, then Sarfaraz Ahmed & Co. produced a clinical performance, making everyone forget their pathetic World Cup outing. Now they are ready to tame the Lions again. In the second match, Babar Azam became the third-fastest batsman to score 11 ODI centuries, taking just 71 innings, behind South Africans - Hashim Amla (61) and Quinton de Kock (65). He could have won the man of the match award for bettering India captain ENTITY (82) in that particular race, considering the contempt et al. But it went to left-arm pacer Usman Shinwari, who claimed his second five-wicket haul.\n\nFor the visitors, gloom is the word that best defined their tour so far. They arrived in Pakistan on a gloomy day after a gloomy preparation then the gloom turned into despair. 300ish targets are normal these days. But at the first time of asking after whitewashing Bangladesh 3-0 at home, Sri Lankans found themselves in a pitiable situation - 5/28 in 61 balls. Then, as in every other gloomy tale, a silver lining flirted with them. The score became 205 without losing further wicket with a different Jayasuriya and Dasun Shanaka stitching a match-high stand of 177 runs. Then, believe it or not, petulant floodlights conspired against them at the National Stadium. Soon after two stoppages due to darkness, both the set batsmen got out, and it was all over in a jiffy.

Virat Kohli,0,"#Final ODI: Babar Azam celebrated the return of ODI cricket in Pakistan with a superlative ton in the last match. He seems to be in Virat-Kohli like touch in ODIs and the ease with which he paces his innings, gives you the feeling that he has decoded the art of batting in ODIs. Sri Lankans would spend a lot of time discussing about him but that?s not the only concern the visitors have, their top-order was blown away by Usman Shinwari under conditions which are tailor-made for the top-order batsmen. And their fielding was pretty unlike Sri Lanka in the last game. It?s hard to imagine them defeating this Pakistan team but the 177-run partnership between Shehan Jayasuriya and Dasun Shanka will give them some self-belief. More than that, the unpredictability which Pakistan team is renowned for will give them some hope. The biggest disappointment in the last game was the crowd turnout. Hopefully, more people will be in present in the crowd today. Toss and team sheets in a bit.\n\nPreview:\n\nODI cricket in Karachi is synonymous with a storehouse of memorable matches. The drama of Waqar Younis running through West Indies' lower order with reverse swing to power the hosts to a tense win in 1990, or India's nail-biting triumph in 2005 is recounted from one generation to another. So, when ODI cricket returned to Karachi after 10 long years, there was excitement and witnesses of tales of past heroics. To make it a great day for home fans, Pakistan took a 1-0 lead with a comfortable 67-run victory in the second ODI versus Sri Lanka on Monday (September 30).\n\nAfter the first match was washed out due to persistent rain, the home team would have been pleased with their clinical show. Babar Azam continued to compile tall scores and ended up with his 11th ODI century. Meanwhile, Usman Shinwari, who hadn't played an ODI since March, found movement and attacked the stumps to pick up a five-for. Pakistan's batsmen also were able to adapt to the slow nature of the wicket. Azam, in particular, took his game to an elevated level by bisecting gaps at will. Iftikhar Ahmed, who mostly bats at number four for the Punjab Province in List A cricket, also showcased his skills with an aggressive hand lower down the order.\n\nAs the caravan moves over to the final ODI at the same stadium, the hosts still have a few worries. Sarfaraz Ahmed, the Pakistan skipper, hasn't been in good form in the 50-over format. The wicketkeeper-batsman didn't exactly have a good time in the World Cup, finishing with only one fifty and eked out just eight runs while batting in the slog overs in the second ODI versus Sri Lanka. The tourists, meanwhile, looked quite flat on the field. There were a string of misfields, with the stand-in skipper, Lahiru Thirimanne himself making a few errors. To make matters worse, the batting line-up crumbled as Sri Lanka slid to a pitiful 28 for 5 while chasing a sizeable 306.\n\nHowever, there is usually a silver lining in defeat, and that came in the form of the 177-run stand between Shehan Jayasuriya and Dasun Shanaka for the sixth wicket to take the tourists to a score of some respectability. Jayasuriya and Shanaka, who have played only 11 and 21 ODIs respectively, would certainly take enough positives from the game. Just that for Sri Lanka to draw the bilateral rubber 1-1, they need more players to step up and contribute.\n\nWhat: Pakistan vs Sri Lanka, 3rd ODI\n\nWhere: National Stadium, Karachi\n\nWhen: Wednesday, October 2 at 3 pm local\n\nWhat to expect: A rain shower or two is forecast in the morning before clearing up. The track is again expected to be on the slower side with the captain winning the toss set to bat first. The conditions for the second game were also conducive for old ball swing.\n\nTeam news:\n\nPakistan: Even though the likes of Mohammad Hasnain, the tearaway, and Asif Ali, the hard-hitting batsman, are waiting in the wings, the home team would be tempted to go in with the same side that triumphed in the second ODI.\n\nSri Lanka: Meanwhile, the tourists could tinker with the side, bringing in the tall seamer Kasun Rajitha in place of Nuwan Pradeep."
Virat Kohli,0,"Visakhapatnam: Rohit Sharma made a dream start as a Test opener, scoring an unbeaten 115 off 174 balls to take India to a commanding 202 for no loss at tea on day one of the series opener against South Africa here Wednesday.\n\nWhile South African bowlers did trouble the Indian batsmen on a few occasions in the first session, they seemed toothless in the afternoon session where Rohit and Mayank Agarwal (84 not out off 183) scored at a brisk rate.\n\nRohit, who got to his fifty before lunch, shifted gears and was particularly harsh on the spinners.\n\nHe hammered offie Danie Piedt for successive sixes over deep midwicket to get into the nineties before completing his fourth Test ton with a single off debutant spinner Senuran Muthusamy.\n\nThe entire dressing room including skipper ENTITY stood up to laud Rohit's feat. His unconquered innings comprised 12 fours and five sixes.\n\nAt the other end, Agarwal was cruising towards his maiden Test ton. He too looked assured at the crease and played his shots.\n\nEarly into the afternoon session, he brought up his half century with a spectacular six over extra cover off Keshav Maharaj.\n\nClouds gathered over the stadium towards the end of the session and thunderstorms forced the umpires to take the tea break eight minutes before scheduled time.\n\nEarlier, Rohit and Agarwal played out 30 overs in the morning session after safely negotiating the South African pacers Kagiso Rabada and Vernon Philander, taking India to 91 for no loss.\n\nIndia, who had named their playing on the eve of the first Test, opted to bat on a dry surface with skipper Kohli calling his decision a \""no brainer.\""\n\nExpecting the pitch to turn, South Africa picked three spinners in Maharaj, Piedt and Muthusamy, who is more of a batting all-rounder.\n\nAll eyes were expectedly on Rohit whose stop-start Test career has taken a new direction with the management accommodating him at the top of the order.\n\nHe left the first ball he faced before driving Rabada past backward point with minimal feet movement for a four.\n\nHis second scoring shot was also a boundary as he punched Philander towards backward point. The pitch offered very little to the pacers and spinners in the first two hours of play.\n\nWhat worked for Rohit was standing outside the crease when Philander was bowling to negate any little swing that was available.\n\nRabada has the express pace but he did not test the Indian openers as much as Philander.\n\nRohit and Philander's battle in the first hour was absorbing. Philander, who got the better of Rohit in the warm-up game, challenged Rohit by moving the ball both ways in his opening spell of four overs.\n\nAfter a few play and misses, Rohit chose to walk down the pitch before South Africa skipper Faf du Plessis asked wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock to stand up to the stumps.\n\nIndia reached 37 for 0 in 15 overs with Rohit and Agawal looking solid in the middle.\n\nAfter getting the measure of the surface, Rohit went for his strokes like he does in white-ball cricket.\n\nHis first big hit was a typical one as he gently stepped out of the crease to smash Maharaj over long-on. A little later, he played a similar short off Piedt, only this time the ball flew well above the long-on fielder.\n\nRohit completed his 11th Test half-century towards the end of the session but in a not so convincing fashion. He mistimed a sweep but fortunately it was not in the reach of the fielder and went for four."

This information was discovered according to a police complaint lodged by officials, reported NDTV.\n\nThis complaint was filed with the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) on September 30 and later had been seen by Reuters.

PMC,1,"The RBI on Tuesday began its rate-setting huddle amid widespread expectations that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) headed by Governor Shaktikanta Das would slash benchmark interest rate to revive the sagging economy.\n\nThe Governor has already hinted that the benign inflation provides room for further monetary policy easing while space for fiscal space is limited.\n\nThe government has already announced a series of measures including steepest cut in corporate tax, rollback of enhanced surcharge on Foreign Portfolio Investors, among others to jump-start growth which hit a six-year low of 5 per cent during the first quarter of the current fiscal.\n\nThe six-member MPC is scheduled to announce the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy for 2019-20 on Friday, October 4, after a three-day meeting. There is no meeting of the panel due to national holiday on October 2, which marks birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nThe central bank has already slashed the repo rate four times consecutively this year amounting to 110 basis points in aggregate.\n\nAt its last meeting in August, the MPC reduced the benchmark lending rate by an unusual 35 basis points to 5.40 per cent.\n\nThe upcoming MPC meeting comes in the backdrop of the RBI's mandate to banks to link their loan products to an external benchmark, like repo rate, for faster transmission of reduction in policy rates to borrowers, from October 1.\n\nAhead of the meeting, the Das-headed Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) sub-committee took stock of the prevailing macroeconomic situation.\n\nEarlier, the RBI Governor had said the government has little fiscal space, giving hopes that the central bank may provide more monetary stimulus to prop up the economy.\n\nThe government's fiscal space has been squeezed on account of cut in rates of corporate tax as well as lowering of GST rate on various goods. Revenue collection too has been below the Budget estimates.\n\nExperts opine that another rate cut is on the cards as the government's hands are tied and the onus of taking initiatives now rests with the central bank.\n\nShanti Ekambaram, President, Consumer Banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said with inflation still within the RBI's medium-term target of 4 per cent, the MPC has the headroom to cut the repo rate further.\n\n\""However, the recent volatility in crude oil prices and the fiscal measures announced by the government will have an impact on inflation in the medium term and the fiscal deficit. Hence, we expect the MPC to be more measured in its response with a rate cut of 20-25 basis points in the October policy,\"" she said.\n\nAccording to NAREDCO president Niranjan Hiranandani, there is expectation of a further 50 basis points repo rate cut in the backdrop of muted inflation which stands lower than the expected 3.2 per cent.\n\nThe further reduction of repo rate will not only bring down the lending rates but also incentivise investment and boost consumption, he said.\n\nWhile economic activities are showing sings of sluggishness, the policy makers are drawing solace from the fact that retail inflation remains in the comfort zone of the central bank.\n\nRetail inflation inched up to 3.21 per cent in August but remained within the RBI's comfort zone. The RBI has been mandated by the government to ensure that inflation remains below 4 per cent, with deviation of 2 per cent on either side.\n\nExperts and industry feel low inflation provides enough headroom for the RBI to further lower the policy rate, especially when festive season has just started. People make huge purchases during Navratras and Diwali.\n\nWith liquidity concerns in the NBFC sector almost taken care of, the real estate sector too is hopeful that the RBI will go in for the much needed rate cut to boost demand for affordable housing.\n\nAlso Read | Indiabulls hits over five-year low, rattled by merger concerns and probe\n\nAlso Watch | ENTITY Bank crisis: Are cooperative banks being run without checks?"

Narendra Modi,0,"When Martin Luther King Jr. visited the villa in Mumbai, India, where Mohandas Gandhi stayed in the 1920s, he had a special request: He wanted to spend the night in Gandhi's bedroom.\n\nIt was 1959, 11 years after Gandhi's death. The house, called Mani Bhavan, where the Indian leader taught followers to spin their own fabric and where he launched satyagraha -- his movement for truth and nonviolent resistance -- had been converted into a museum. In an austere top-floor room where Gandhi's mattress and shoes still lay, King said he could feel \""vibrations\"" of the Mahatma, or great soul.\n\n\""[King] was booked in a very good hotel. But he said, 'I am not going anywhere else. I am going to stay here, because I am getting vibrations of Gandhi,' \"" recalls curator Usha Thakkar.\n\nSo curators hauled in two cots, and the American civil rights leader and his wife, Coretta Scott King, slept the night next to Gandhi's vacant mattress. Afterward, Martin Luther King told All India Radio that he'd decided to adopt Gandhi's method of civil disobedience as his own.\n\nNow, six decades later, many black Africans are calling Gandhi a racist. #MeToo activists are questioning his sexual practices. Hindu nationalists are rejecting Gandhi's vision of a pluralistic India that is strengthened by diversity.\n\nGandhi is still revered. He helped win India freedom from British colonial rule in 1947. But as the world marks what would be his 150thbirthday on Wednesday, some of his habits and teachings are facing fresh scrutiny.\n\nThere's no way around it: Gandhi was a racist early in his life, says his biographer Ramachandra Guha.\n\n\""Gandhi as a young man went with the ideas of his culture and his time. He thought in his 20s that Europeans are the most civilized. Indians were almost as civilized, and Africans were uncivilized,\"" Guha, 61, told NPR in an interview in May at his home in Bengaluru, India.\n\n\""However, he outgrew his racism quite decisively, and for most of his life as a public figure, he was an anti-racist, talking for an end to discrimination of all kinds,\"" he said.\n\nThat included gender discrimination. Gandhi championed women in politics. But he was also obsessed with his own celibacy. In his late 70s, before he died at 78, he slept naked with his grandniece when she was in her late teens. He said he wanted to test his willpower to abstain from sex.\n\nNowadays, most people would call that abuse. Some question whether the young female was capable of giving consent as a minor to a man who was so revered and so much more powerful than she.\n\nIn 1962, when British filmmaker Richard Attenborough began researching what would become his 1982 Gandhi film, he asked Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, how he should portray his late colleague. Nehru famously replied that Gandhi was \""a great man, but he had his weaknesses, his moods and his failings.\"" He begged Attenborough not to turn Gandhi into a saint. He was \""much too human,\"" Nehru said.\n\nFather of the nation\n\nIn India, Gandhi is nevertheless treated as a saint -- the father of the nation. His birthday, Oct. 2, is a national holiday. Gandhi's face is on India's currency. His portrait hangs in government offices.\n\nPractically every major city in the country has at least one Gandhi memorial. At the garden in New Delhi where he was assassinated in 1948, just months after India's independence from Britain, tourists can stroll the stone walkway where Gandhi took his final steps.\n\n\""When people come here, they get highly emotional. Some of them have tears in their eyes and go back with a heavy heart,\"" says researcher Sailaja Gullapalli, giving NPR a tour. The garden and the house on its premises, now another Gandhi museum, get about 200,000 visitors a year.\n\nOn Gandhi's 150th birthday, events are planned across the globe: a vegetarian food festival in London and a walkathon for peace and tolerance in Dubai. Across India, schools are holding special assemblies and singing the freedom leader's favorite prayer songs. There are trash collection drives and a mass fabric-spinning session at the Mahatma's old Mumbai villa.\n\nBut India is also where the Mahatma may have fallen furthest from the pedestal.\n\nHindu nationalists in power\n\nThe man who assassinated Gandhi, Nathuram Godse, was a follower of Hindutva -- Hindu nationalism. Godse wanted India to be a Hindu country and objected to Gandhi's vision of India as a secular, pluralistic democracy. (India is about 80% Hindu but also has one of the world's largest Muslim populations, making up about 14% of the country, or around 180 million people.)\n\n\""The Hindutva type of ideology considered [Gandhi] to be an enemy because he was talking of secularism and not of Hinduism,\"" says Yogesh Kamdar, honorary secretary of the Mani Bhavan museum and the son of Indian freedom fighters.\n\nGandhi's vision won. When colonial India was partitioned in 1947, Hindu-majority India became a secular democracy, alongside the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\n\nBut Hindu nationalists are now in power in India. Some of them still don't accept Gandhi's vision. Like Godse, they want India to be a Hindu country. Some extremists among them even celebrate Gandhi's murder.\n\nMembers of a far-right Hindu group, the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha, shot and burned Gandhi's effigy on his death anniversary this year. In May, a parliamentary candidate from Prime Minister ENTITY's mainstream Bharatiya Janata Party called Gandhi's assassin, Godse, a \""patriot.\""\n\nThat shocked the country. The candidate, Pragya Thakur, was forced to apologize -- but nevertheless won her election. She is now a member of Parliament representing the central Indian city of Bhopal.\n\nThakur is an outlier though. Most Indian politicians admire Gandhi, and even those who don't have to tread very carefully.\n\n\""Very grudgingly, and maybe as a part of strategy, they have also adopted Gandhi as an icon. They had to!\"" says Kamdar. \""Otherwise it is very difficult to survive politically.\""\n\nModi is headlining events for the 150th anniversary. The Mahatma's signature round spectacles are the logo for Modi's Clean India campaign -- a national sanitation effort inspired by Gandhi.\n\nGandhi's philosophy\n\nOn weekends, crowds throng a park in New Delhi to pay their respects at the spot where Gandhi was cremated, called Raj Ghat. There's a long black marble slab covered in marigolds and topped with an eternal flame. The memorial inspires reverence, and also a few whispered debates about the Mahatma's legacy.\n\n\""It's gone nowadays. It's really gone,\"" tourist Ira Parikh, 44, says of Gandhi's swadeshi movement -- the idea that Indians should spin their own cloth and work in simple local industries. \""Few [people] are following these things anymore. I don't think it's practical.\""\n\nParikh says the historical figure's ideas can seem a bit quaint in booming, globalized India. Her two sons learn about him in school, but one of them says he struggles to see how those lessons apply to his own life.\n\n\""When someone says, 'Oh, he was great,' there's always some criticism,\"" says Harsh Parikh, 17, recounting debates with friends about Gandhi's tactics. \""Like, 'No, he could have got us freedom way before' [if he had been willing to use violence].\""\n\nWhat these teenagers are weighing is at the very heart of Gandhian philosophy: \""His absolute insistence on nonviolence, which young men see as pussyfooted and weak-kneed and -- dare I say -- feminine and hence not macho enough,\"" says Guha, the biographer.\n\nGandhi's restraint can look naive in today's India, confronted with terrorism. Modi has sought to portray himself as a strong pair of hands who isn't afraid to strike at neighboring Pakistan if provoked. (Both countries have nuclear weapons.)\n\n\""Palace of cards\""\n\nAt the other memorial across New Delhi, in the garden where Gandhi was shot dead, a 76-year-old man sits with a spinning wheel. He comes every Friday, he says, because Gandhi was assassinated on a Friday.\n\nA retired civil servant, Musaddilal Gupta escapes modern India for about an hour a week \""as a tribute to him,\"" he says. A few steps from where Gandhi died, Gupta spins his own thread -- as the Mahatma taught.\n\n\""When this becomes cloth and when I wear it, it's a feeling of joy, to produce something yourself,\"" Gupta says. \""His principles are so strong! You may or may not accept it.\""\n\n\""But the day will come when this palace of cards will fall,\"" he says, \""and Gandhian principles will remain."
Narendra Modi,0,"India is to be declared \""open-defecation free\"" by prime minister ENTITY on Wednesday evening, although experts question his bold claim that all 1.3 billion people in the country have access to a toilet.\n\nModi made his \""latrines for all\"" pledge when he first assumed office in 2014 and is hailing the project's success as India celebrates the 150th anniversary of the birth of independence hero Mahatma Gandhi, a sanitation champion.\n\nSince being elected, Modi's government says it has built almost 100 million toilets, winning the leader plaudits abroad, including an award from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation last week.\n\nIn March, the government had said fewer than 50 million people relieved themselves outside, down from 550 million in 2014, with more than 550,000 villages declared open-defecation free.\n\nHowever, experts are sceptical over his claims, citing data from rural as well as urban areas.\n\n\""A lot of latrines have been constructed from 2014 to 2018. Latrine ownership increased from about 35 percent to about 70 percent,\"" said Sangita Vyas from the Research Institute for Compassionate Economics (RICE).\n\n\""That increase did accelerate the reduction of open defecation but in December 2018 we estimated about half of people in the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan still defecated in the open,\"" she told AFP, doubting that the shortfall has been made up since.\n\nMany of the toilets that have been constructed are without a water connection and even when they are connected, cultural barriers stop many Indians from using them, experts say.\n\n'Gandhi's dream'\n\nModi, 69, was set to make the grand announcement in his western home state of Gujarat on Wednesday evening in front of 20,000 village chiefs.\n\nHe was also due to visit the Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat, where Gandhi based himself for many years, and where 10,000 jars of treated human faecal matter were to be handed to guests, the Indian Express daily reported.\n\nThe nutrient-rich matter -- sun-dried, sieved into a tea leaf-like consistency and packed into the glass jars together with seeds -- will then sprout upon watering.\n\nBefore that, Modi early on Wednesday paid his respects to Gandhi, who was assassinated the year after India gained independence from Britain in 1947, at the Raj Ghat memorial in New Delhi.\n\nHe said on Twitter that India was expressing \""gratitude to Mahatma Gandhi for his everlasting contribution to humanity. We pledge to continue working hard to realise his dreams and create a better planet.\""\n\nOther events also took place nationwide including in a hospital room in Pune where Gandhi was operated on for appendicitis in 1924.\n\nAs many as 600 prisoners were also set to be released in an amnesty, media reports said.\n\nLater on Wednesday, a year-long, 14,000-kilometre (8,700-mile) \""global peace\"" march was due to leave Delhi bound for Switzerland and taking in 10 countries."

Fadnavis himself will be addressing as many as 60 rallies across the length and breadth of the state in the upcoming days.\n\nIt should be noted that Fadnavis is the first CM of the state of Maharashtra in about five decades to have completed an entire term and is aiming to get re-elected. The BJP led by him is likely to contest the polls on over 155-162 seats, while the Shiv Sena is expected to contest the polls in other 126 seats."

The house, called Mani Bhavan, where the Indian leader taught followers to spin their own fabric and where he launched satyagraha -- his movement for truth and nonviolent resistance -- had been converted into a museum. In an austere top-floor room where Gandhi's mattress and shoes still lay, King said he could feel \""vibrations\"" of the Mahatma, or great soul.\n\n\""[King] was booked in a very good hotel.

Donald Trump,0,"Everywhere you turn progressives are pushing the idea of diversity. It's in our school curriculum, in every TV show and movie, and now even in corporate commercials. But within the era of Newspeak, what is now called diversity is actual progressive dogmatic orthodoxy. The only permitted diversity is in the narrow, acceptable progressive doctrine. It is acceptable to hold any opinion on the number of human genders if that number is greater than twelve. The current politically acceptable number is one hundred twelve. To say there are only two genders will get you send to re-education camp, or diversity training, and subjected to the two minutes of hate.\n\nThe progressive movement today is a bastardization of what it once was. A good friend who is Dean at a prominent university is one of the first people I know who described himself thirty years ago as a progressive.

Donald Trump,0,"Murder is on the decline in America, according to a new FBI report.\n\nThe nation's top federal law enforcement agency found that homicides fell by 6 percent in 2018. The decline in homicides is part of a 3 percent drop in the violent crime rate, according to the Uniform Crime Report, the FBI's annual tally of crimes reported to local police departments. The 2018 decline follows several years of slight increases in homicide and violent crime, driven largely by spikes in major cities such as Chicago and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe drop may represent a continuation of America's long-running crime decline, or of the aggressive tactics of President ENTITY's Department of Justice. The relatively small magnitude of the decline, especially in light of other evidence, suggests America may have reached a new normal for violent crime rates.\n\nOverall, violent crime rates fell by just under 4 percent, from 383.8 offenses per 100,000 people to 368.9, the report shows. That decline reflects not just the 6 percent reduction in the homicide rate, but also decreases in the robbery and aggravated assault rates. Among violent crimes, only the rate of rapes increased, rising from 41.7 rapes per 100,000 people to 42.6. The property crime rate fell for the 19th consecutive year.\n\nThe drop in the homicide rate, in particular, represents a significant change for the nation.

Donald Trump,0,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - The House Ways and Means Committee received information from a federal employee at the end of July alleging that there was \""possible misconduct\"" and \""inappropriate efforts to influence\"" the Presidential audit program, according to a letter from the committee's chairman.\n\nCommittee Chairman Richard Neal is suing the US Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service to obtain six years of President ENTITY tax returns as well as records from several of his business entities. The Presidential tax audit program, conducted by the IRS, automatically audits every incoming President's taxes and Neal has argued that he wants the records to make sure the Presidential tax audit program is working properly or if necessary make legislative fixes.\n\nTrump and his defenders have argued there is no legislative purpose for the committee to have access to Trump's returns and that Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, is only interested in getting information that could be damaging to the President.\n\nNeal wrote to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about the complaint, and included a version of the letter in an August court document.\n\nNeal said in his letter to Mnuchin that the allegation underscores the need for oversight of the program. The House has argued it needs the information to understand how the Presidential audit program, which is not enshrined in law and is shrouded in mystery, is carried out. Democrats argue that any allegation that the program was carried out differently under Trump could bolster the House's case.\n\n\""On July 29, 2019, the Committee received an unsolicited communication from a Federal employee setting forth credible allegations of 'evidence of possible misconduct'-specifically, potential 'inappropriate efforts to influence' the mandatory audit program,\"" Neal wrote in his letter to Mnuchin dated August 8. \""This is a grave charge that appreciably heightens the Committee's concerns about the absence of appropriate safeguards as part of the mandatory audit program and whether statutory codification of such program or other remedial, legislative measures are warranted.\""\n\nThe allegation, which came in a little-noticed court filing as part of the ongoing fight in court for Trump's tax returns, has come under renewed scrutiny following a separate whistleblower from the intelligence community who issued a complaint charging that the President had used his office \""to solicit interference\"" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election and then that the White House took steps to conceal the efforts.\n\n\""I can't get into the specifics of the whistleblower because that's something Chairman Neal will have to address, but it is clear that the information that we are getting strengthens our concern and our argument that the President may not be subjected to the laws that the IRS is supposed to enforce,\"" said Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Michigan and a member of the House Ways and Means committee, in an interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow on \""Newsroom\"" Tuesday.\n\nThe administration previously told the Committee that no individual would face backlash for carrying out an audit, but Neal wrote in his letter to Mnuchin that \""the allegations received by the Committee cast doubt on this statement and underscore the pressing need for complete and meaningful oversight of the mandatory audit program.\""\n\nTrump has for years repeatedly refused to release his tax returns -- dating back to his days before he was in office and on the campaign trail -- breaking with decades of precedent of presidential candidates from both parties releasing tax returns as well as other personal financial documents."

Pretty much according to the \""Scream\"" outline.\n\nOn Thursday, the Financial Times published an expose of the London property deal at the center of the current Vatican scandal: a building in London's prestigious Chelsea neighborhood that is scheduled to be transformed into luxury flats.\n\nFollowing the paper trail, the UK newspaper discovered that from 2014, the Vatican's Secretariat of State - using private banks and shell companies - bought up a 45 percent stake in the property, costing around $200 million.\n\nAlthough the Vatican has long invested in the London property market - a sure thing in recent decades - the Chelsea deal was hit by the uncertainty of Brexit, leading the Vatican to seek to buy the building outright to recoup its losses. How much it paid in the end is unknown, and work on the project has still not begun.\n\nHowever, not everyone was a loser in the deal. The Financial Times reports that Raffaele Mincione, an Italian former banker who arranged the deal, made over $150 million in profits, not only from selling the building (which he owned at the time), but by charging the Vatican millions of dollars in fees to manage the deal. The newspaper reports that Mincione also sold bonds to the Vatican to raise funds for his unrelated projects.\n\nAt the center of the controversy is now-ENTITY Giovanni Angelo Becciu, who at the time of the deal was serving as the Substitute for General Affairs in the Secretariat of State, a high-ranking position analogous to the pope's chief of staff.\n\nThe Financial Times reports the deal was made under Becciu's supervision and with his approval, and the newspaper questions why he would have agreed to the terms proposed by Mincione.\n\nHe was created a ENTITY, and then made head of the Vatican's saint making office, in June 2018 - just before the Vatican sent an official to London to buy the Chelsea property outright.\n\nBut the Financial Times report seems to only be the pre-credits taster for Vatileaks III -- L'Espresso has announced it has received the Vatican magistrate's documentation on the case, which it will be publishing on Sunday.\n\nIn a preview published Thursday, the magazine said Vatican prosecutors identified \""serious indications of embezzlement, fraud, abuse of office, money laundering,\"" and other financial crimes, with another report noting \""very serious crimes such as embezzlement, corruption and abetting.\""\n\nThe Italian magazine says Becciu is not the only one under the microscope: It claims his successor and current Substitute, Venezuelan Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra, is also under scrutiny.\n\nThe L'Espresso report also promises to shine a light on the tens of millions of dollars of fees paid to Mincione and other financiers who advise the Secretariat of State on its investments, many of them of a dubious nature.\n\nOf course, in the background of the story is the fact that most of the financial reforms of the Vatican - many instituted because of the issues brought to light in the previous Vatileaks scandals - have stalled. The Secretariat for the Economy - already cut down a bit even before its head, ENTITY George Pell, went to Australia to unsuccessfully fight historic charges of child sex abuse - has been without a new boss for over two years. The Vatican's first-ever auditor general, Libero Milone, was fired in 2017, accused by Becciu of spying on his superiors. He, too, hasn't been replaced.\n\nThis is all just the first act Vatileaks III: On Monday, a new book is coming out promising to expose the full extent of Vatican financial malpractice.\n\nIts title is Universal Judgement, and its author is none other than Gianluigi Nuzzi.\n\nAccording to the \""Scream\"" theory, anything can happen in the third film of a trilogy, so there's no telling how Vatileaks III will play out - but for any Vatican official who thinks that weathering this storm will bring an end to the drama, there's bad news.\n\nScream 3 didn't end the trilogy: Not only was there a Scream 4, eventually they made a television series. The Vatican is hoping that their franchise doesn't follow the same formula."
AL CARDINAL Investments,0,"\Say it nicer.\"" No words better sum up the news coverage of Hunter Biden. That instruction from him to ABC News reporter Amy Robach came after she noted that he was \""in and out of rehab\"" several times for dependency on drugs ranging from cocaine to crack. In fact, the media has been \""saying it nicer\"" for weeks, telling readers and viewers there is \""no finding of wrongdoing\"" by Joe BidenJoe BidenWarren defends, Buttigieg attacks in debate that shrank the field Five takeaways from the Democratic debate in Ohio New study: Full-scale 'Medicare for All' costs trillion over 10 years MORE's son while avoiding any substantive discussion of his controversial business dealings.\n\nDuring the ABC News interview, Hunter Biden moved between muted apologies and indignant denials about alleged efforts to cash in on his father's position. The interview was galling for those critical of this common form of corruption. For three decades, I have written about the practice of giving lucrative jobs and contracts to the spouses and children of powerful politicians as a way of gaining influence in Washington.\n\nHunter Biden's deals are textbook examples of how political families become rich from public service. Nevertheless, many in the media continue to repeat Joe Biden's position that \""no one has asserted my son did a single thing wrong.\"" That, of course, is untrue. Even if Hunter Biden's deals did not amount to crimes, they were wrong. They have always been wrong, but both parties have always protected these deals as a dirty little secret.\n\nHunter seemed to struggle to find his identity in explaining his deals. He was asked why he accompanied his father on an official trip to China in 2013, shortly before he signed a deal with the Bank of China to manage as much as $1.5 billion in investments. \""I have traveled everywhere with my dad,\"" he replied. The problem is that he was 43 years old at the time. He was not some oversized lap child.\n\nBut after admitting that he probably was given such lucrative deals because of his dad, he then suggested the opposite. Pressed about his credentials to be a director of a Ukrainian energy company, he said, \""I was vice chairman of the board of Amtrak for five years. I was the chairman of the board of the United Nations World Food Program. I was a lawyer for Boies Schiller Flexner, one of the most prestigious law firms in the world.\""\n\nIndeed, he was given all of those positions, but they raise the same concerns over whether he earned them. Hunter Biden has the prototypical resume of the progeny of the powerful in Washington. He seemed to land jobs far beyond his experience or proven skills. Most law school graduates work for six years just to make junior partner in a firm. Yet, directly out of law school in 1996, he was given a lucrative position with MBNA America, a bank holding company that was not only a campaign contributor to his father but a business actively lobbying for lending changes in Congress. His father, then a powerful senator in Congress, supported changes that benefited the company.\n\nAnd, within a couple years of graduating, Hunter Biden had amazingly ascended to the position of executive vice president. He then was given a position in the Commerce Department before he became a high paid lobbyist. In 2006, President Bush made Hunter Biden a member of the board of directors of Amtrak; no one seriously argued at the time that his resume even remotely qualified him for that position, any more than his assuming the board chairmanship of the U.N. World Food Program.\n\nAt the time, Democratic Senator Tom Carper of Delaware said Hunter Biden was qualified in being put on the board of Amtrak because \""Hunter Biden has spent a lot of time on Amtrak trains.\"" He later was given a position with the law firm of Boies Schiller Flexner while he was establishing an investment firm. Frankly, his resume is filled with high-paying positions but few known accomplishments to justify them.\n\nIn a key exchange, ABC's Robach asked about Hunter Biden going with his father on an official trip to China. Shortly after that trip on Air Force II, Biden signed a deal with Chinese businessman Jonathan Li and BHR Partners to invest as much as $1.5 billion in Chinese capital, including funding from the government-supported Bank of China. Robach correctly noted that President TrumpDonald John TrumpWarren defends, Buttigieg attacks in debate that shrank the field Five takeaways from the Democratic debate in Ohio Democrats debate in Ohio: Who came out on top? MORE is completely wrong in claiming that Biden walked away with $1.5 billion or made millions from the deal. Indeed, Biden insisted he has not made a dime on the deal.\n\nRobach, however, then moved on without addressing the obvious point: Hunter Biden hoped to get a percentage of a business that was seeking $1.5 billion. He simply failed in the effort. Saying that you failed to make a ton of money hardly gives you the ethical high ground by default. Hunter also brushed over the fact that, on the official visit, he had his father take a photo with Li, his business partner. He insisted it was all a wonderful coincidence of a \""friend\"" staying at the same hotel. Nor was he pressed on why, if his deal made no money for years, he just got around to resigning this month.\n\nHunter did admit that his deal with Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian energy company, may have shown \""poor judgment\"" -- but not because it was an obvious effort at influence peddling. Nor because he took $50,000 a month from one of Ukraine's most corrupt figures. Or because he got the deal when his father controlled potentially billions in U.S. loans and aid to Ukraine. No, he said, it was because \""I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That is where I made the mistake.\""\n\nIn other words, he broke the ENTITY rule of the progeny of the powerful: Never allow your personal enrichments to become public controversies. Ultimately, the real impact of this controversy turns on any responsibility of Joe Biden. In his interview, Hunter Biden insisted: \""I didn't have any discussions with my father before or after I joined the board as it related to it, other than that brief exchange that we had.\""\n\nRobach repeated that denial while ignoring the obvious contraction in Joe Biden's earlier categorical denial of any knowledge of his son's dealings. This is where the spin moves from nice to nonsense. The point of the original question to Joe Biden was whether he knew his son was doing business in Ukraine when the vice president dangled more than $1 billion in loans in front of the Ukrainian government. The senior Biden categorically denied any knowledge: \""I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\""\n\nThe Washington Post adopted this spin in its dubious \""fact check\"" in which it acknowledged that Hunter did tell his father about the dealings -- but, since Joe Biden just told his son to be \""careful,\"" the Post concluded \""that's not much of a discussion.\"" That is not the point, however. The point is that Joe Biden knew of a glaring conflict in what anyone would recognize as an effort at influence peddling.\n\nIn response to all of this, Joe Biden has declared: \""I can tell you now, if I am your president -- next president -- I'm going to build on the squeaky clean, transparent environment that we had in the Obama-Biden White House.\"" That is a rather odd statement since his son's controversial deals in Ukraine and China occurred during that administration, as did controversial payments to the Clintons and their foundation from foreign interests. That is not exactly the model many of us have in mind. In the end, it is hard to say much of this \""nicer\"" but the questions still need to be asked."
AL CARDINAL Investments,0,"The pope fired the head of his security detail and called in a mafia prosecutor to get to the bottom of secret London apartments, and what happened to money in his charity fund.\n\nROME-A few hours before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with his Vatican counterpart Pietro Parolin in Rome in early October, the Swiss Guard gendarmes raided a key office in Parolin's department.\n\nThey were acting on orders from \up high,\"" and cleaned out the offices of the Holy See's Financial Information Authority (AIF), which is essentially meant to be the watchdog agency set up to keep an eye out for any illicit activities at the Vatican Bank, which has been embroiled in dozens of scandals over the years. The gendarmes carted away computers, documents, and as many secret hard drives as they could find. Then they left and sealed the office.\n\nThe investigators were looking into what may seem like just the latest scandal within the Vatican's beleaguered financial system. But this time it touched Pope Francis personally with allegations that money meant for his beloved charities for the poor was actually going into pricey London property and seedy apartments alleged to be used for sinful activities.\n\nFive people, including AIF director Tommaso Di Ruzza, were banned from entering the Vatican's fortified walls while the investigation tied to the raid was carried out. A wanted poster -- featuring photos of the five people who worked in the office and meant for Swiss Guards' eyes only to know who not to let in -- was inevitably leaked to the press.\n\nPope Francis, to put it mildly, was pissed off that the wanted poster was leaked and the reputations of those on it -- who may not be guilty of anything -- sullied. A Vatican statement condemned the outing of those on the wanted poster as \""prejudicial to the dignity of the people involved.\"" The pope turned to his security chief Domenico Giani to find out exactly who leaked the photo. On Monday, his detective work still fruitless, Giani resigned.\n\nIn his official letter of explanation, he blamed his inability to smoke out whoever leaked the photos. \""I felt shame for what happened and for the suffering of these people,\"" he wrote, according to the letter sent to Vatican accredited journalists. \""Having always said I was ready to sacrifice my life to defend the Pope's, in the same spirit I made the decision to resign.\""\n\nMany now wonder if there is more to Giani's resignation, just as details of the AIF raid are starting to sound something like the explosive scandal in the 1980s tied to American Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, mobsters, Masons, and murder. That scandal is also loosely related to the disappearance of Italian teen Emanuela Orlandi, who some believe was tasked with delivering a message from Marcinkus to someone he was collaborating with or to Orlandi's father -- it has never been clear -- and then killed to stop her from testifying. In the Marcinkus scandal, Roberto Calvi, the head of Italy's largest private bank before it collapsed, which was tied to Marcinkus' crafty accounting, ended up hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London with a pocket full of bricks and cash in various currencies.\n\nThis latest scandal also leads to the U.K., but so far at least, no one has been killed. The Italian newsmagazine L'Espresso uncovered a trail that leads to a former warehouse for Harrods on Sloane Ave. in London, which the Vatican controls through British Grolux Investments Ltd. -- which records show is run by the Vatican's Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See (APSA). Apparently, around $400 million that was earmarked for the pope's charity fundraiser Peter's Pence -- named for Peter, the Catholic Church's original pope tapped by Jesus -- went to pay off the mortgage of private apartments in the warehouse.\n\nInvestigative documents unearthed by L'Espresso say the property now houses about 100 apartments, some of which are frequented by priests and other clergy as a sort of lurid London getaway. There have been reports in the Italian press of gay brothels where priests meet up with young men, and on rarer occasions, young women, as well as other unseemly activities taking place on the premises, but apart from going door-to-door, it is impossible to verify. Rome is filled with gay saunas frequented by priests that operate in the shadow of St. Peter's Basilica, so it would surprise few if the clergy got up to the same thing when they traveled abroad.\n\nJust days after his gendarmes raided the AIF offices, Francis assigned anti-Mafia prosecutor Giuseppe Pignatone to head the Vatican court assigned to get to the bottom of the Vatican Bank's alleged charity theft. Previous wrongdoings have been investigated internally. Tapping an outsider like Pignatone marks a change in strategy and sends a clear message that the pontiff doesn't exactly trust the usual gatekeepers. Among Pignatone's many accomplishments in his storied career fighting organized crime is helping pull back the curtain on Rome's own mafia that involved a one-eyed gangster and 40 thieves. Whether the pope believes there is a link between the Roman mafia and the Vatican Bank has not been made clear. The first case Pignatone will preside over is the trial of Angelo Caloia, the former Vatican Bank president who is accused of embezzling millions off Vatican property deals.\n\nThe Vatican Bank, officially known as the Institute for Religious Works or IOR, has been sketchy for years. In 2013, the European Central Bank closed down its credit card capabilities, meaning everyone from tour groups slogging through the Vatican Museums to nuns trying to buy rosaries had to pay cash on Vatican property. In 2014, Francis created the first ever Secretariat for the Economy to try to unravel the mess. But the first head of that department was ENTITY George Pell, now appealing a child sex abuse conviction in Australia. Pell had announced the discovery of hundreds of millions of dollars that were not accounted for when he first took the job. He has not yet been replaced and doesn't look like he will return any time soon. It is little wonder that Francis has been left with no choice but to handle things first-hand if he ever hopes to clean up the Vatican's dirty money problems."
AL CARDINAL Investments,0,"VATICAN CITY (RNS) -- Pope Francis' \guardian angel\"" handed in his wings on Monday. Domenico Giani, the head of the Vatican police force, submitted his resignation amid the latest leaks and scandals surrounding the Catholic institution's finances.\n\n\""In order to assure the proper serenity to the ongoing investigation,\"" the statement Monday (Oct. 14) by the Vatican reads, \""and although the Commander bears no personal responsibility in the unfolding of the events, Domenico Giani has tendered his resignation to the Holy Father out of love for the Church and faithfulness to Peter's Successor.\""\n\nThe statement acknowledges that the perpetrator of the latest leak \""remains unknown,\"" even though it was distributed only among the Vatican police force, the Gendarmerie, and the Swiss Guards. The statement also says that Francis recognizes Giani's \""unquestionable faithfulness and loyalty,\"" which guaranteed \""a lasting atmosphere of ease and security around the Holy Father.\""\n\nAccording to local media outlets, the reason behind Giani's dismissal is due to the latest wave of leaks surrounding foreign investments by the Vatican Secretariat of State. A document obtained by Italian news magazine l'Espresso on Oct. 2 and signed by the former police head showed pictures of five Vatican employees barred from entering the Catholic city-state.\n\nThe pictures of the people in question, two of whom are employed in high-profile institutions in the Vatican (the Vatican anti-money laundering organization AIF and the Secretariat of State), resembled mugshots even though the document made no mention of the nature of the allegations against them.\n\nRELATED: Making sense of the Vatican's looming financial scandal\n\n\""An inquiry was launched by the Holy Father,\"" said Vatican spokesmen Matteo Bruni to local media this weekend, \""on the illicit distribution of a document intended for internal use by the security forces of the Holy See.\""\n\nBruni said that \""the gravity\"" of this leak is comparable, in the words of Pope Francis, \""to a mortal sin, because it is damaging to the dignity of the people and of the principle of presumption of innocence.\""\n\nRumors that Francis was looking to assign the head of the Vatican Gendarmerie to another position have been circulating for months. But a closer look at the 20-year tenure of the \""comandante\"" raises questions as to why he was allowed to continue in his position for so long.\n\nIn 1999, Giani became the deputy of Camillo Cibin, former Vatican police chief, and tackled a woman attempting to attack then-Pope Benedict XVI during Christmas celebrations in 2008 and again in 2009. Giani became inspector general of the Gendarmerie Corps in June 2006 and the personal bodyguard to Pope Francis and his predecessor.\n\nGiani has been a fixture at papal audiences and apostolic visits for two decades, a time that included some of the most perilous moments in the Catholic Church. The Vatileaks scandals in 2012 and 2015 shed light on the administration of Vatican finances by the Institute for Religious Works, also known as the Vatican bank. Both these scandals occurred during Giani's tenure and he led the investigations on the cases.\n\nIn an interview in Italian released on l'Osservatore Romano on Monday, Giani said he recognized that the recent release of the document \""certainly trampled on the dignity\"" of the people concerned and that he himself \""felt shame for what happened.\""\n\n\""I tried to carry it out with self-denial and professionalism but feeling serenely like a 'useless servant' who has done his little part to the end,\"" he told the Vatican media.\n\n\""For this reason, having always said and testified my readiness to sacrifice my life to defend that of the pope, with this same spirit I have made the decision to hand in my resignation so as not to damage in anyway the image and activity of the Holy Father,\"" he said.\n\nGiani oversaw numerous reform efforts by three popes to bring order, transparency and accountability into the Vatican finances. He also coordinated the Vatican Fire Department and was a member of the Financial Security Committee created by Pope Francis in 2013 to prevent money laundering, the financing of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nGiani's role in promoting Francis' financial reform was put into question in 2017, when the then-auditor general at the Vatican, layman Libero Milone, was forced to resign after being charged with alleged double-dipping on expenses amounting to $33,000 and espionage. All charges against Milone were dropped, but the former financial inspector claimed in interviews that Giani forced him to resign under duress.\n\nThe former police head, who has a background in the Italian secret service, was also embroiled in a 2013 scandal surrounding the arrest on money laundering charges of Italian Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, former auditor at the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See, the Vatican's financial powerhouse that controls both its investment portfolio and its real estate holdings.\n\nMedia outlets also questioned the funding of Giani's expensive work on his apartment near the Vatican as confirmed by several Italian news outlets and sources near the Vatican. The complex profile that emerges is hard to place within Pope Francis' often-stalled financial reform efforts.\n\nThere has been no announcement as to what position Giani will continue to occupy within the Vatican, if any, and in the context of reports of a looming financial scandal in the Vatican -- a possible new Vatileaks -- there are questions of whether the commander's resignation will be the last one we'll see in the coming months.\n\n\""Unfortunately, within the Vatican, the sense of loyalty and fealty to the institutions is falling short,\"" said Italian ENTITY Angelo Becciu, former deputy secretary of state who was tapped to head the Vatican Congregation for Saints' Causes by Pope Francis, in a recent interview with Italian TV network Mediaset.\n\nBecciu's name has been linked to investments of Vatican finances in London real estate and in his remarks he spoke of the necessity of \""receiving the pope's appeal to be a united community."

OFAC is also designating five companies determined to be owned or controlled by ENTITY, and one company owned or controlled by Ajing. OFAC designated these individuals and entities pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13818, which builds upon and implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and targets perpetrators of serious human rights abuse and corruption.\n\n'These South Sudanese elites and corrupt government officials have drained state coffers and usurped the country's resources with impunity.

Following OFAC's designation of Benjamin Bol Mel in December 2017, the senior South Sudanese official began to use a bank account in the name of one of ENTITY's companies to store his personal funds in an attempt to avoid the effects of potential sanctions designations. Further, in early 2019, the South Sudanese government made millions of dollars in payments to a company owned by ENTITY; while the official reason was for the payment for food, the money instead went to senior South Sudanese government officials. Other South Sudanese government officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the massive corruption in the South Sudanese government, noting that although large amounts of money were paid to ENTITY for supplies and provisions, government forces never seemed to be adequately supplied.\n\nSeparately, a company partially owned by ENTITY has been publicly implicated in the importation of amphibious armored vehicles into South Sudan that gave the Government of South Sudan the ability to extend offensives that included violent attacks on innocent civilians.\n\nFive companies owned or controlled by ENTITY were also designated today: ENTITY General Trading Limited, ENTITY General Trading LLC, ENTITY, ENTITY Petroleum Company limited, and NILETEL.\n\nENTITY is being designated for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery.\n\nKUR AJING ATER\n\nAjing is a South Sudanese businessman who has bribed key officials in the Government of South Sudan in order to maintain influence and access to the South Sudanese oil market.

In late 2018, the South Sudanese government made a large cash payment to Ajing. While the official reason was for the payment of food, the money instead went directly to a senior South Sudanese government official. In addition, Ajing has been obligated large amounts of oil by the Government of South Sudan, and has given money and vehicles to government officials in return. Ajing has claimed to have paid senior officials millions of dollars and has cooperated with the request of a senior official to route oil payments in cash rather than through official bank accounts. Further, Ajing was the recipient of a multi-year contract to purchase food for the South Sudanese military, and in return, paid a percentage of the contract back to a senior South Sudanese government official. According to public media reports, Ajing received millions of dollars in contracts for the South Sudanese military, including one contract that alone exceeds the total amount budgeted for the military's goods and services for the year by a factor of ten.\n\nAjing is being designated for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, an entity that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery.

AL CARDINAL Investments,0,"VATICAN CITY (RNS) -- Last week, the Vatican released a mysterious statement acknowledging a raid by Vatican police on the offices of its Secretariat of State and of its financial watchdog agency, saying it was carried out by judicial order by the Vatican tribunal and with permission from unspecified \""superiors.\""\n\nThe Secretariat of State is the most powerful department in the Vatican bureaucracy. The Financial Information Authority, or AIF, was created in 2010 by then-Pope Benedict XVI to combat money laundering following the Vatileaks banking scandal.\n\nThe communique stated that Vatican police \""acquired documents and electronic devices\"" in the raid, presumably having to do with the secretariat's financial dealings, following charges presented last summer by the Institute for Religious Works, commonly known as the Vatican bank, and the office of the Revisor General, which is responsible for investigating corruption.\n\nThe Vatican has never publicly mentioned the charges, however, and last week's brief statement didn't explain the reason for the raid. Requests for clarification to the Vatican Press Office went unanswered.\n\nThe raid seems to be the latest shoe to drop in the Catholic Church's ongoing attempt to reform the Vatican's financial arm, an effort that has suffered setbacks of late. The three departments Francis created to champion the reform, the Secretariat for the Economy, the office of the Auditor General and the Council for the Economy, have been decapitated or have shown themselves to be ineffective.\n\nIn 2014, Francis named Australian ENTITY George Pell prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, who set about cleaning up the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See, the financial center at the Vatican. But a year later, Pell became embroiled in charges of sexual abuse of two choristers in Australia; he is currently serving a six-year prison sentence. No substitute has been appointed by Francis to take his place.\n\nLibero Milone, selected by Francis to be the first auditor general, was unceremoniously kicked out of the Vatican in 2017 by the gendarmerie before he was able to finish his work for alleged double-dipping on expenses amounting to $33,000. All charges against him have since been dropped, and Milone, who had accused a former papal chief of staff, now ENTITY Giovanni Angelo Becciu, of financial malfeasance, has said his ouster was politically motivated.\n\nMeanwhile, little has been heard from the Council for the Economy, as its head, ENTITY Reinhard Marx, grapples with tensions with the bishops in his native Germany. On Sept. 20, the council had an extraordinary meeting with representatives from various Vatican departments, allegedly for the purpose of reining in the Vatican budget deficit of over $76 million, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nFrancis hasn't given up. Last week, two days after the raid, he named a former lawyer for the city of Rome, Giuseppe Pignatone, as president of the Vatican tribunal.\n\nPignatone is well known for his commitment to fighting syndicated crime in the Italian capital, a choice that has led some local media to suspect that the financial scandal has taken a complex turn.\n\nIf last week's one-paragraph explanation of the raid only seemed to invited speculation, the Roman media's rumor machine was happy to oblige. Journalists clamored to reach their sources and paced the halls seeking clerics and laypeople to explain this new Vatican riddle.\n\nItalian daily \""L'Espresso\"" got there first. On Wednesday (Oct. 3) the paper published an image of a document issued by the head of the Vatican police, Domenico Giani, showing pictures of five people, four lay and one religious, all of whom were said to be \""cautiously suspended from service.\"" It is not clear why the Vatican did not share the document with the press, as it was handed out widely to Vatican employees.\n\nIn the Oct. 3 article, L'Espresso's Vatican reporter, Emiliano Fittipaldi, explained that the current scandal revolves around investments made by Becciu and Monsignor Alberto Perlasca, who oversaw the secretariat's financial investments until he was abruptly removed by Francis this summer.\n\nStarting in 2011, according to Fittipaldi, the two prelates made investments with two Luxembourg-based companies using money that may have been derived from donations by the faithful. The investments are said to concern a real estate property in London.\n\nPerlasca's name appears in the document published in L'Espresso, as does that of Monsignor Mauro Carlino, who oversees the Office of Information and Documentation of the Vatican Secretariat of State. His position was previously held by Carlo Maria Polvani, nephew of the papal accuser and former Vatican representative to the United States, Carlo Maria Viganò.\n\nAlso named were Tommaso Di Ruzza, second in command to Financial Information Authority President René Brülhart, Vincenzo Mauriello, of the Secretariat of State's protocol department, and Fabrizio Tirabassi, who oversaw the Secretariat of State's financial investments after Perlasca's departure.\n\nFinally, there was Caterina Sansone, an administrative assistant at the Secretariat of State who answered to Tirabassi.\n\nAll of them are barred from entering the Vatican, with the exception of Carlino, who resides in the Domus Sanctae Martae, a hotel that is also the pope's current residence.\n\nBut what these people are accused of -- if anything -- is still unknown, and speculation in the Italian press has shed no light on how any alleged misdeeds are related to their higher ups, if at all. One story this week had Becciu being told by Pope Francis that he is no longer allowed to leave the Vatican.\n\n\""How funny!\"" the veteran ENTITY tweeted in answer. \""Just yesterday the pope wished me safe travels for the flight that tomorrow will take me to Brazil!\"""
AL CARDINAL Investments,0,"VATICAN CITY -- A police raid on offices in the Vatican Secretariat of State, the suspension of five Vatican officials, and the appointment of a leading Italian anti-mafia magistrate as head of the Vatican's criminal tribunal have sparked intense speculation about the extent of financial corruption in the Holy See.\n\nVatican prosecutors seized documents, computers, telephones and passports and blocked bank accounts in Tuesday's raid on the administrative section of the Vatican Secretariat of State, the Church's central governing body.\n\nThe Vatican's Financial Information Authority (AIF), which is the Vatican's anti-money-laundering watchdog, was also raided.\n\nA Vatican statement on Tuesday said the promoter of justice of Vatican City Court, Gian Piero Milano, and Alessandro Diddi, adjunct promoter of justice, ordered the search after complaints in early summer from the Institute for Religious Works (IOR) -- commonly called the Vatican Bank -- and the Office of the Auditor General about financial transactions \carried out over time.\""\n\nAccording to Italian media reports, those transactions revolve around expensive property deals, primarily a 2013 multimillion-dollar real estate transaction in London's prestigious Mayfair district, which is said to have taken significant losses.\n\nThe documents seized on Tuesday reportedly relate to the years 2011 to 2018, the period when ENTITY Angelo Becciu, now the prefect for the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, was sostituto, the official responsible for the administrative affairs of the Secretariat of State.\n\nThe Italian magazine L'Espresso reported that Tuesday's action led to the suspension of five officials: Msgr. Mauro Carlino, head of documentation at the Secretariat of State, and four lay officials: Tommaso Di Ruzza, the director and No. 2 official at the AIF, Fabrizio Tirabassi, who manages financial investments in the Secretariat of State, and Vincenzo Mauriello and Caterina Sansone, administrators in the same dicastery. Di Ruzza did not respond to a Register request for comment.\n\nThe raid and suspension show the reforms begun by Benedict XVI and continued by Francis \""really work\"" and that new laws for Vatican City State \""are being applied,\"" the Vatican said in an unsigned editorial in L'Osservatore Romano, also published at the Vatican News website.\n\n\""The painful events made public this week are not a sign the system has failed,\"" it continued, \""but rather show the system has \""developed antibodies capable of reacting\"" and that the process of reforming Vatican finances is \""well underway.\""\n\nBut in the same editorial, the Vatican chastised the media for subjecting the five suspended officials to \""pillory,\"" as \""any possible responsibility on their part is still to be proven.\"" It said a Vatican investigation will determine how that information was leaked, but omitted to mention that the names were distributed internally to all Vatican staff.\n\nTuesday's events were also followed this week by the appointment on Thursday by Pope Francis of one of Italy's leading anti-mafia prosecutors as president of the Vatican's criminal tribunal.\n\nPignatone's reputation as a leading Italian chief prosecutor, who has handled major investigations into the Cosa Nostra and 'Ndrangheta organized crime gangs in Sicily and Calabria, points to the extent of the financial corruption needing investigation in the Vatican.\n\nHe replaces Giuseppe Dalla Torre, who oversaw two \""Vatileaks\"" trials, one involving the leaking of documents by Pope Benedict XVI's former butler and the second relating to a priest and lay official working in Vatican finances. Dalla Torre was also involved in the prosecution of the former president of the Bambino Gesu, the Vatican's children's hospital, that also has been embroiled in a web of corruption allegations, including assertions that the U.S.-based Papal Foundation was improperly induced to provide funds to bail out the troubled institution.\n\nThe Register was told that the main target of this week's raid was not primarily the five suspended officials, nor the current leadership in the Secretariat of State, but rather others who have since left the dicastery and whose past actions continue to be subject to scrutiny.\n\n\""This raid was not against the current sostituto, Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra, who is striving to perform a clean-up of the mess he has inherited in the general affairs section administrative offices, but, rather, his predecessor, ENTITY Becciu, and his administrative right-hand man, Msgr. Alberto Perlasca,\"" an informed source told the Register.\n\nIn 2009, then-secretary of state ENTITY Tarcisio Bertone appointed Msgr. Perlasca head of the administrative office of the Secretariat of State -- an influential position that included handling all financial transactions passing through the Secretariat of State. ENTITY Bertone appointed ENTITY Becciu as sostituto in 2011.\n\nPope Francis, well acquainted with Msgr. Perlasca since he served in the nunciature in Buenos Aires from 2006 to 2008, retained him as head of the administrative office until July this year, when he appointed him promoter of justice at the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, the Church's highest court.\n\nTirabassi was an assistant to Msgr. Perlasca, and Msgr. Carlino, who had only been in the post of head of documentation since July, was for many years the personal secretary of ENTITY Becciu.\n\nThe Register source said Archbishop Peña Parra has been making progress on putting the finances in order and that the suspension of Msgr. Carlino was to \""move him away\"" from the current sostituto, \""to distance him from highly confidential material.\""\n\nAlthough not directly and publicly accused of wrongdoing, ENTITY Becciu has been indirectly connected with the sudden dismissal in 2017 of the Vatican's first auditor general, Libero Milone.\n\nMilone maintained his innocence, telling the media at the time that \""a small group of powers\"" were trying to defame his reputation and that they were afraid of what financial accounts and other details he might show to the Pope and ENTITY Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state.\n\nENTITY Becciu said at the time that Milone \""went against all the rules and was spying on the private lives of his superiors and staff, including me.\"" Milone insisted it was the other way around, and last year the Vatican dropped all charges against him.\n\nThe Register asked ENTITY Becciu Oct. 4 if he wished to comment on this week's raid and whether he knew of the ill-advised London real estate deal at the center of the raid, but at the time of writing he was reportedly on his way to Brazil and has yet to reply.\n\nThe investigations into the Secretariat of State are reportedly connected with the prosecution of Angelo Caloja, a former Vatican Bank president accused of embezzlement.\n\nInternal sources also believe there are connections with financial misconduct reported in the Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See (APSA), the dicastery which handles the Vatican's real estate, several of which are in prime areas of London, and financial assets.\n\nIn July, the Register reported on a similar mishandling of London real estate investments by APSA, as well as cyphered accounts in Switzerland connected to the same dicastery.\n\nVatican investigations into these areas, notably by ENTITY George Pell, then prefect of the Secretary for the Economy, and Milone, led to a series of obstacles emerging, most significantly the abrupt ending in 2017 of the first external audit of the Vatican.\n\nA few months later, Milone was dismissed, and ENTITY Pell was forced to leave the Vatican to defend himself in Australia against clerical sex-abuse charges, which he vehemently denied."

OFAC is also designating five companies determined to be owned or controlled by ENTITY, and one company owned or controlled by Ajing. OFAC designated these individuals and entities pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13818, which builds upon and implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and targets perpetrators of serious human rights abuse and corruption.\n\n'These South Sudanese elites and corrupt government officials have drained state coffers and usurped the country's resources with impunity. ENTITY and Ajing leverage their businesses and political connections to engage in corruption at great expense to the South Sudanese people,' said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. 'The South Sudanese government must take urgent measures to increase transparency and enforce accountability against those involved in systemic corruption.

Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC or otherwise exempt, OFAC's regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. In addition, any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a U.S. person, wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited by E.O. 13818 if performed by a U.S. person or within the United States would be prohibited.\n\nASHRAF SEED AHMED ENTITY\n\nSudanese businessman ENTITY has been used by a senior South Sudanese government official as an intermediary to deposit and hold a large amount of funds in a country outside of South Sudan. Following OFAC's designation of Benjamin Bol Mel in December 2017, the senior South Sudanese official began to use a bank account in the name of one of ENTITY's companies to store his personal funds in an attempt to avoid the effects of potential sanctions designations. Further, in early 2019, the South Sudanese government made millions of dollars in payments to a company owned by ENTITY; while the official reason was for the payment for food, the money instead went to senior South Sudanese government officials. Other South Sudanese government officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the massive corruption in the South Sudanese government, noting that although large amounts of money were paid to ENTITY for supplies and provisions, government forces never seemed to be adequately supplied.\n\nSeparately, a company partially owned by ENTITY has been publicly implicated in the importation of amphibious armored vehicles into South Sudan that gave the Government of South Sudan the ability to extend offensives that included violent attacks on innocent civilians.\n\nFive companies owned or controlled by ENTITY were also designated today: ENTITY, ENTITY LLC, Al Cardinal Investments Co.

Ajing used these bribes to both curry favor with a senior gatekeeper within the Government of South Sudan and to ensure the silence and compliance of a key government officials. In late 2018, the South Sudanese government made a large cash payment to Ajing. While the official reason was for the payment of food, the money instead went directly to a senior South Sudanese government official. In addition, Ajing has been obligated large amounts of oil by the Government of South Sudan, and has given money and vehicles to government officials in return. Ajing has claimed to have paid senior officials millions of dollars and has cooperated with the request of a senior official to route oil payments in cash rather than through official bank accounts. Further, Ajing was the recipient of a multi-year contract to purchase food for the South Sudanese military, and in return, paid a percentage of the contract back to a senior South Sudanese government official.

Iran,0,"India: Robbers board LPG tanker at Kakinada Anchorage\n\n23 September\n\nFour robbers boarded an LPG tanker at Kakinada Anchorage using a hook attached to a rope at 2325 hrs local time. Alert crew noticed the robbers and raised the alarm. The robbers reportedly escaped on a boat with ship's stores after hearing the alarm. The incident was reported to local authorities.\n\nPGI Analysis: Robberies are intermittently reported at Kakinada Anchorage, particularly overnight when thieves take advantage of low visibility. Although some robbers are reported to be armed, instances of violence are rare, indicating thieves are predominantly armed for self-protection or intimidation.\n\nSouth East Asia\n\nIndonesia: Robbers board tanker berthed at Dermaga Kencana terminal\n\n19 September\n\nTwo robbers boarded a tanker berthed at Dermaga Kencana terminal, Balikpapan at about 0100 hrs local time. Alert crew noticed the robbers and raised the alarm. Upon hearing the alarm, the robbers escaped without stealing anything.\n\nMalaysia: Abu Sayyaf kidnap three Indonesian fishermen off Sabah\n\n23 September\n\nSeven assailants in two pump boats wearing camouflage uniforms and masks approached two fishing vessels at approximately 1200 hrs local time, around 6.3 nm north of Pulau Tambisan, Sabah. The assailants, armed with M16 rifles, an RPG launcher and pistols, boarded the fishing vessels, held the crew at gunpoint and took their phones and IDs. The assailants kidnapped three Indonesian crew members from a Malaysian fishing vessel and headed to Tawi-Tawi Islands. It is likely the assailants were part of the kidnap-for-ransom detachment of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG). Malaysian and Philippine authorities increased their maritime patrols and intensified their military operations in an effort to rescue the kidnapped crew members. The attack took place in broad daylight, which is rare in the area as most kidnappings occur at night.\n\nPhilippines: Suspected robber attempts to board tanker in Mabini Anchorage\n\n24 September\n\nDuty crew onboard an anchored product tanker noticed a person attempting to open the anchor hawse pipe cover at 0100 hrs local time in Mabini Anchorage. The crew raised the alarm and mustered. The incident was reported to the local agent. No further details were immediately available.\n\nPGI Analysis: Robbers often target transiting and anchored and berthed vessels across Southeast Asia. Most robberies are opportunistic, but assailants have previously used force to extract their demands. Coordinated patrols by Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore along with increased security on vessels have led to a decrease in piracy in recent years.\n\nAn unspecified number of pirates reportedly stormed two passenger boats off the Nigerian coast on Bonny waterway. The boats were reportedly moving towards Bonny Island, the base of Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas, when the attack occurred. No further details were immediately available. Pirates often kidnap crew for ransom off Nigeria's coast.\n\nPGI Analysis: Pirate attacks off Nigeria are common and can occur up to 150 nm off the coast, demonstrating pirates' extensive geographical range of operation. Pirates are often armed and violent and there is precedent for attackers to persist when under attack from armed security teams until they have been injured or killed.\n\nAlbania: Authorities seize 137 kg of cocaine at Durres port\n\n27 September\n\nAuthorities seized 137 kg of cocaine at Durres port from a ship travelling from Ecuador.

Iran,1,"Following the brutal killing of Saudi dissident and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, one year ago, the Saudi government became something of a toxic commodity in American politics. Several high-profile lobbying and public relations firms dropped the Saudis as a client. Think tanks, including the Brookings Institution, severed ties with the Saudi government. Businesses pulled out of a major conference in Riyadh shortly after Khashoggi's death.\n\nAs the U.S. intelligence community, and the United Nations, were determining that Saudi Arabia was culpable in the killing, members of Congress demanded accountability. Democrats led the charge on a series of bills that would have halted U.S. arms sales to the kingdom and ended U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition's disastrous war in Yemen. Republicans were outraged too. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who claimed on \Fox & Friends\"" to have once been Saudi Arabia's \""biggest defender on the floor of the United States Senate,\"" announced shortly after Khashoggi's death that Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, \""has got to go.\"" The crown prince denies a role in Khashoggi's death; the U.N. sees credible evidence warranting further investigation.\n\nDespite the backlash directed at the kingdom, the Saudis haven't faced serious consequences for the slaying of Khashoggi or its slaughter of civilians in Yemen. That is thanks in large part to one man -- President Trump. He has loudly and emphatically defended Saudi Arabia at every opportunity. According to a July House Oversight committee report, he recently considered giving Riyadh nuclear technology without appropriate safeguards to prevent nuclear proliferation, in part at the behest of the chair of his inaugural committee, Thomas J. Barrack Jr. He has also tweeted at least a fleeting willingness to go to war with ENTITY on Saudi Arabia's behalf following the attacks on Saudi oil fields, something the American public overwhelmingly doesn't support.\n\nTrump's principal argument for siding with the Saudis has to do with the alleged economic benefits of U.S. arms sales to the kingdom. It all began during his May 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia, when he touted a purported $110-billion arms deal that would mean \""jobs, jobs, jobs\"" for Americans. The deal itself, according to the Washington Post \""Fact Checker,\"" was considerably smaller than the administration claimed, with much of it composed of sales already approved under the Obama administration or speculative offers that would happen years from now, if ever. And a report from our organization, the Center for International Policy, found the president's claims of U.S. jobs tied to Saudi arms deals were greatly exaggerated -- 10 to 20 times the actual number.\n\nThe facts, however, have not prevented Trump from vetoing a series of congressional measures aimed at ending U.S. military support and arms sales to the region.\n\nWhile Trump appears to be the commander-in-chief of Saudi Arabia's public relations efforts in the U.S., he's far from alone. Even with several firms abandoning the influence machine the Saudi's had assembled before Khashoggi's killing, the Saudi lobby is still represented in the U.S. by more than 20 \""K Street\"" firms, according to the Department of Justice . This includes influential operators such as Squire Patton Boggs and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck -- whom the Saudis paid over $1 million on Oct. 4, 2018, just two days after Khashoggi was killed at the Saudi consulate -- and the McKeon Group, whose namesake, former Rep. Howard \""Buck\"" McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), was once the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also dramatically increased funding to many of the lobbying and public relations firms that stayed with them post-Khashoggi. In fact, one firm -- Qorvis Communications, the Saudis' longtime public relations gurus in America -- received nearly $18 million from the kingdom in just the first three months after Khashoggi's death, more than most countries spend on all of their lobbying activities for an entire year. Washington lobbyists acting as agents of Saudi Arabia have also continued to give lavishly to House and Senate campaigns, in some cases on the same day they met with members of Congress or their staffs to discuss the kingdom.\n\nAll of this has served a critical function for the Saudi regime: maintaining enough support in Congress to ensure Trump's vetoes aren't overridden, which keeps the U.S. government from punishing the Saudis for Khashoggi's death.\n\nPresident Trump's protection of Saudi Arabia is at best a temporary shield. Veterans, peace and human rights groups, and other interest groups have been pushing Congress to block U.S. military support for the kingdom by invoking provisions of the War Powers Resolution and making amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act. Human rights organizations also have pushed beneficiaries of Mohammed bin Salman's private charity -- among them the New York Public Library and the United Nations -- to abandon their connection to the foundation, which the crown prince uses as a propaganda platform.\n\nYet, one year after Khashoggi's killing, and 4 ½ years into the brutal Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, Congress and the president have yet to hold Saudi Arabia accountable. That cannot be allowed to stand. On the anniversary of Khashoggi's murder, we owe it to him to stand up to the Saudi lobby and the president, and once and for all punish the Saudi government for what it has done."
Iran,1,"North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile on Wednesday - possibly from a submarine - just days ahead of the expected resumption of nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea after a seven-month hiatus.\n\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff says the missile was fired from waters off the peninsula's east coast near the port city of Wonsan, and traveled about 280 miles to the east before landing in the Sea of Japan.\n\nSouth Korea's National Security Council standing committee held a meeting after the test and voiced its \strong concern.\""\n\nThis would appear to be the most powerful weapon North Korea has tested since a February summit in Vietnam between President Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un. That meeting ended without a denuclearization agreement.\n\nThe test came just hours after North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui was quoted by state media as saying that working-level denuclearization talks would begin with a day of preparatory meetings on Friday, before getting underway on Saturday. Choe did not mention a possible venue for the talks.\n\nWhile Trump has downplayed Pyongyang's series of missile and rocket launches since then, today's test prompted speculation that talks could be delayed.\n\nNorth Korea has issued an ultimatum, threatening to abandon negotiations for good if the U.S. does not show a more flexible strategy and come to the table with concessions by year's end.\n\nTrump has indicated he is willing to adopt a \""new method\"" in talks, and last month fired his national security adviser John Bolton, the administration's chief opponent of partial denuclearization deals with both North Korea and ENTITY.\n\nThe projectile fired today is believed to belong to North Korea's Pukkuksong or North Star class of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), believed first tested with solid fuel in August, 2016.\n\nSouth Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo told a parliamentary committee that the Pukkuksong class is capable of flying distances up to around 910 miles, but this time the missile was launched in a 565-mile high arc, shortening its horizontal trajectory.\n\nSolid-fuel SLBMs can be launched more quickly than liquid-fueled missiles and the underwater launch platform makes them harder to detect and target. North Korea is not known to be able to launch them from a submarine yet, but has used submersible barges for tests.\n\nThe Pukkuksong class of missiles is intended to be capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.\n\nJapanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said a missile fell into Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone, off the western prefecture of Shimane.\n\nJapan's Kyodo News Agency quotes Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as saying: \""Such a ballistic missile launch is in breach of U.N. Security Council resolutions and we strongly protest and condemn it.\""\n\nHighlighting internal divisions plaguing the U.S. sponsored system of military alliances in Asia, Kyodo reports that South Korea requested intelligence from Japan about the launch through an intelligence-sharing pact which Seoul is quitting, amid a trade war.\n\nIn Italy, a State Dept. spokeswoman traveling with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, \""We call on the DPRK [North Korea] to refrain from provocations, abide by their obligations under U.N. Security Council resolutions, and remain engaged in substantive and sustained negotiations to do their part to ensure peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and achieve denuclearization.\""\n\nA potent bargaining chip for the North\n\nSince May, Kim Jong Un's public appearances, in which he typically gives instructions or \""field guidance\"" to his subordinates, have largely focused on North Korea's military capabilities and weapons production.\n\nHe has personally overseen several missile launches. Kim appeared to give a boost to his country's SLBM program in July when he visited a new submarine being built at a shipyard. He has also promoted officials in charge of military industries to the top of the North Korean political hierarchy.\n\nAnalysts believe that these visits indicate Kim's distress at returning from Hanoi in February without a deal, when he believed one was in reach. They're also thought to show his ambivalence about a future agreement, and his determination to deal with the U.S. and South Korea from a position of strength.\n\nStronger military capabilities could strengthen Pyongyang's hand in negotiations with the U.S. by constituting a threat held in reserve, or an asset to be bargained away, for the right price.\n\nNorth Korea's missile launch \""also appears to take into consideration multiple factors, including our military's demonstration of its latest military assets yesterday,\"" Defense Minister Jeong Kyong-doo told lawmakers.\n\nYesterday was South Korea's Armed Forces Day, and it put on display for the first time several F-35 fighter jets recently acquired from the U.S.\n\nThe F-35s represent a conundrum for U.S. allies in Asia. Their purchase helps to mollify the Trump administration, which wants South Korea and Japan to contribute more to their defense costs. But it infuriates North Korea, which is working to develop missiles to counter the F-35s and the bases from which they fly."
Iran,1,"The Trump administration has not grasped there is a global race to dominate the clean energy industry.\n\nThe United States has a unique geopolitical position and a global energy system based on an accelerated transition to renewables could either compromise or strengthen the nation, depending on its choices.\n\nIn another installment in our series of renewable energy and geopolitics interviews, Indra Overland - head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute for International Affairs - explained, as other countries become energy more self-sufficient or rely on imports from near neighbors, they will have less dependence on international oil and gas trade security guarantees provided by the U.S.\n\nIf the States jettisons fossil fuels, said Overland, it will lose a major geopolitical advantage. \People tend to forget that the United States is a very major fossil fuels producer in its own right,\"" said the analyst. \""The main chance for the United States to retain its global dominance in the energy sector would be through maintaining its lead on innovation and intellectual property related to clean energy technologies.\""\n\nOverland believes the U.S. is not maximizing its advantage in that area despite the strength of American universities, innovation and venture capital.\n\nThe turn away from clean energy\n\nThe Trump administration has reduced support for renewables for various reasons, according to Overland. \""The oil lobby at the business level has deep historical roots and is immensely strong in the United States,\"" he said. \""In addition, regions with oil, gas or coal extraction have large groups of working class people who feel threatened by [the] energy transition.\""\n\nThe nation also has a unique dependence on the car, Overland pointed out, however there are strong arguments in favor of clean energy in the United States.\n\nThe American political system hands outright power to one side or the other and Trump and the Republican Party have their hands on the wheel at present, despite receiving less than half the votes cast in the 2016 election. \""That may change in the future and there may also be change internally among the Republicans, many of whose young voters are becoming more preoccupied with climate change,\"" said Overland.\n\nThe professor described Trump's attitude to renewables as more negative than ambiguous. \""But on the other hand I think that attitude is not very deep felt,\"" he added, explaining the president and his party have to engage with interest groups who may be persuaded to come onside. The academic gave the example of the divisive issue of abortion, claiming many of the most strident anti-abortion voices in the Republican Party may simply be playing politics. \""They do this because there are large voter groups - including many Catholic women whom they otherwise would have little chance to attract - whom they hope to win over this way,\"" he said.\n\nIf young voters are concerned about climate change, suggested Overland, Republican Party attitudes could change on the issue.\n\nDependence on the Middle East\n\nLess dependence on fossil fuels would mean less dependence on oil imports from the Middle East but the region would remain strategically important to the U.S., particularly Egypt and the Suez Canal.\n\nIsrael would remain an important ally, said Overland, adding: \""Logically, apart from those two points, U.S. interest in the Middle East should decline, as it would have much less interest in propping up Saudi Arabia, influencing Iraq or invading ENTITY if the oil is no longer needed. However, one's answer to this question depends on how one interprets the world today. Many people believe that the United States invaded Iraq to get control over oil. However, what in practice ensued was that the invasion of Iraq destabilized the region and removed oil from the world market, sending oil prices sky high.\"" The academic pointed out the period after the invasion of Iraq saw some of the biggest profits ever banked by companies in history - accrued by American oil companies.\n\n\""Did the U.S. really invade Iraq to get hold of oil, or to get rid of it? Is it sanctioning and threatening ENTITY to protect Israel or to keep ENTITYian oil off international markets and keep oil prices high? Does the United States really care about democracy and human rights in the Middle East?\"" Overland asked.\n\nThe answers to those questions, Overland said, determine what sort of future relationship to anticipate between the U.S. and the Middle East. \""The motivations of states - which consist of millions of citizens and tens of thousands of organizations and interest groups - are hard to parse and the answers to such questions therefore remain elusive,\"" he said.\n\nTrade wars and solar\n\nAsked whether the tariffs applied to Chinese PV imports to the U.S. have a geopolitical context, Overland said the current American leadership does not understand there is a global race to gain preeminence in clean energy technology. \""I think they are not about promoting [the] U.S. PV industry but rather about the general trade war and about hobbling the development of the PV industry globally,\"" Overland stated. \""However, such actions often have unforeseen consequences and while the Chinese have made an incredible contribution to the development of the global PV sector, a slightly more globally balanced sector might be better in the long run.\n\nThe professor had previously told pv magazine: \""If Trump's trade war is not successful in either breaking down the Chinese or bringing them to heel, their dominance may be very long lasting. China has an immense discipline and vigor and now that it has rediscovered itself after the Maoist years it may keep going for a long time, also in solar power.\""\n\nNew international relations\n\nAs discussed in previous pv magazine interviews, more renewables may push nations towards energy self-sufficiency or greater integration with the energy markets of other countries. Overland believes the former more likely for the United States. \""In the case of Canada, Mexico and the U.S., I don't think transition to renewable energy and electrification necessarily will lead to more integrated transboundary electricity grids,\"" Overland said. While the small nations of Europe will have to cooperate to decarbonize, the U.S. could go it alone.\n\nOne thing is certain, Overland said, more renewables and a reduced need for oil and gas could be used as leverage against Russia and other petrostates. The rise of renewables will clearly weaken states such as Libya, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. On the other hand, the U.S. is also a major fossil fuel power, so it may lose some of its clout.\n\n\""The U.S. may still have supremacy but it would not be quite as important as today - though it would still be important for other reasons,\"" he concluded.\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n""""MUMBAI/DHAKA (Reuters) - From Kathmandu to Colombo, it's a kitchen nightmare: Onion prices have gone crazy.\n\nThat's because India, the world's biggest seller of the Asian diet staple, has banned exports after extended Monsoon downpours delayed harvests and supplies shriveled.

And there won't be any meaningful drop in prices before summer-sown crops start to hit the market, said Ajit Shah, president of the Mumbai-based Onion Exporters' Association.\n\nThat's not expected until mid-November, meaning the export ban isn't going away in the near term.\n\n\""India could resume exports once prices drop, but it will take time,\"" said Shah. \""Until India resumes exports, supplies will remain limited in Asia.\""\n\nFor now, consumers like Kathmandu shopper Pokharel are having to change habits across Asia.\n\n\""I went to buy 5 kilogrammes of onions for our five-member family but ended up buying only 3 kilogrammes due to higher prices,\"" said Afroza Mimi, a Dhaka housewife on a shopping expedition the day after India imposed the export ban.\n\n\""They (traders) are selling old stock nearly at double the price. This is crazy.\"""
Iran,0,"GENEVA -- A plan for talks presented to the United States and ENTITY by French President Emmanuel Macron is broadly acceptable to the Islamic Republic, President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday during a cabinet meeting that was broadcast live.\n\nHe said some wording needed to be changed in the plan, which outlines that ENTITY will not pursue nuclear weapons and will help the security of the region and its waterways, while Washington will remove all sanctions.

Central Bank Of Iran,0,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Facing escalating mass protests, the government of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri approved Monday a package of economic reforms and a 2020 budget without new taxes, hoping to appease people in the streets. Protests swelled in the hours after the announcement, however, as many demonstrators scorned the package as \empty promises.\""\n\nHundreds of thousands of people have flooded public squares across the country in the largest protests in over 15 years, unifying an often-divided public in their revolt against status-quo leaders who have ruled for three decades and brought the economy to the brink of disaster.\n\nSparked by proposed new taxes, the protests have shaken the country and top leaders, who are scrambling to come up with concessions to appease the public.\n\nFollowing a nearly five-hour Cabinet meeting, Hariri announced a series of economic and financial reforms which he described as a \""coup,\"" saying no government in Lebanon's history has taken such radical steps before.\n\n\""The decisions that we made today might not fulfil your goals, but for certain it achieves what I have been seeking for two years,\"" Hariri told the protesters.\n\n\""These decisions are not in exchange for anything. I am not going to ask you to stop protesting and stop expressing your anger. This is a decision that you take,\"" he added.\n\nFollowing his speech at the presidential palace, thousands of people gathered outside his office in downtown Beirut chanting: \""The people want to bring down the regime,\"" and \""Revolution, revolution!\""\n\nThe number of protesters swelled following the Cabinet announcement amid intense skepticism that the reforms amounted to anything serious. They included many young men and women as well as whole families, with children waving the national red and white flag with a cedar tree in the center.\n\nLayan Ajineh, who came to the protest with her two sons, ages 16 and 12, said that politicians \""have not been able to adopt reforms in 30 years, so how did they come up with them in three days?\""\n\n\""This is a joke. Do they think we are fools?\"" said the 40-year-old housewife, who said she's worried about her sons' future in a country where unemployment stands at more than 30%.\n\n\""The people want the government to resign. People see that this government cannot be given another chance,\"" she said.\n\nThe protests have paralyzed the country for five days, with schools, universities, banks and other business shuttered. The protests are building on long-simmering anger at a ruling class that has divvied up power among themselves and amassed wealth for decades but has done little to fix a crumbling economy and dilapidated infrastructure.\n\nIt was not clear how the situation would move forward, especially when the main political parties have all taken the position that the government should not resign. Those include the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah, the President Michel Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement, Hariri's Future Movement and Parliament speaker Nabih Berri's Amal group. In Lebanon, the president is a Maronite Christian, the parliament speaker a Shiite while the prime minister is a Sunni. Cabinet and parliament seats are equally divided between Christians and Muslims.\n\nIt was not clear if the government will take a decision later to break the protests by force in what could lead to a violent crackdown. Hariri urged the army not to intervene with the protesters.\n\n\""If this mood prevails and protests continue at the current pace and scale, the country may be in for a prolonged period of unrest,\"" wrote Heiko Wimmen, of the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. He added that no alternative political leadership or real opposition to the ruling parties exists.\n\nHariri said that the Cabinet approved the 2020 budget Monday with a deficit of 0.63 percent with no new taxes. The reforms include cutting in half the salaries of top officials including ministers and members of parliament, overhauling the electricity sector, working to scrapping the ministry of information and other public institutions and downsizing others as part of cost-cutting measures.\n\nHariri, when asked why people should believe the government is serious this time, said: \""We should gain this confidence since people will not give it to us. If I were in their place in the street, I would not give confidence.\""\n\nHe praised the protesters, saying: \""What you've done has broken all barriers and shook all political parties.\""\n\nHe added that the country's ENTITY and the banking sector, which are flush with cash, will help in reducing the deficit by about $3.4 billion in 2020. The government will also study the privatization of the telecoms sector.\n\nThe banking sector was criticized by many of the protesters, who blamed it for charging the state high interest rates as it carries much of the $85 billion public debt that stands at 150% of the gross domestic product. Some senior politicians are either owners or major shareholders in private banks, and Hariri said taxes will be increased on financial institutions.\n\nThe government will also distribute millions of dollars to families living in poverty and will also give $160 million as housing loans in an attempt to revive the struggling construction sector. Hariri said a law will be drafted to restore money that was usurped as a result of widespread corruption in the country.\n\nLater Monday, President Michel Aoun signed the budget, which will be sent to parliament for discussion and approval.\n\nEarlier, protesters closed major roads around Lebanon ahead of the emergency Cabinet meeting. Demonstrators also placed barriers across major intersections in Beirut as well as other cities and towns across the country.\n\nThese have been the largest protests since the so-called Cedar Revolution in 2005, when Lebanon witnessed a mass uprising against Syria's occupation of the country after Damascus was blamed for the assassination of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri by a massive car bomb.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Fadi Tawil in Beirut and Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report."
Central Bank Of Iran,1,"Nazanin Tabatabaee/WANAA man walks past the ENTITY, Tehran, Iran, Aug. 1, 2019.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Al-Monitor, the governor of Iran's ENTITY, Abdulnaser Hemmati, said he has been able to strengthen the Iranian rial by 40% since the onset of new US sanctions in 2018 that led to the currency's free fall.\n\nCommenting on INSTEX, a financial mechanism set up by Britain, France and Germany to facilitate Iranian trade in light of US sanctions, the ENTITY chief voiced his pessimism, stating, \I have come to the conclusion that the issue is not with INSTEX and its mechanism. The issue is that the Europeans seem to need US approval for their plans.\""\n\nAsked about the destiny of a $15 billion credit line proposal from the French, he answered that \""it depends on the Europeans and the United States to work it out.\""\n\nThe following is a transcript of Al-Monitor's interview with Hemmati, who was named as ENTITY governor in July 2018, coinciding with some of the worst days faced by the Iranian economy after the reimposition of US sanctions. It has been edited slightly for clarity.\n\nAl-Monitor: Following the re-imposition of US sanctions, Iran's rial plunged unprecedentedly, with one dollar currently being traded at about 20,000 rials. Some also attributed the rial's plunge to mismanagement. What role did sanctions play in the devaluation, and what can be attributed to mismanagement?\n\nHemmati: In my view, the exchange rate depreciation was mostly rooted in the expectations surrounding US sanctions. That being said, the restrictions imposed on the market during the unification of the [official and open-market] rates at 42,000 rials for one US dollar, which happened around the same time as the renewal of US unilateral sanctions and [Washington's] withdrawal from the JCPOA, also played a role. These two things, among other factors, led the exchange rate to depreciate. I can add to these factors the spillovers of sanction shocks, [US President Donald] Trump's relentless war of words about cutting Iran's oil exports to zero, and the US' unilateral attempts to cut off our banking system from the rest of the world. Added to all of this, a number of US-backed media outlets were actively running misleading reports about the future of Iran's economy, claiming that the exchange rate would free fall to 300,000 or 400,000 rials [to the dollar].\n\nOn the technical front, we had some issues too. We were lacking technical and software capabilities to monitor foreign exchange transactions for a period of time when the foreign exchange bureaus were shut down, and it took us almost two months to restore this key part of the market. We also lacked an integrated software system that would connect the banks and foreign exchange bureaus, preventing us from effectively monitoring the system and circumventing speculations. With the gradual weakening of the ENTITY supervision on [point of sale] terminals and banking transactions, everyone could transfer any amount using a debit card and a point of sale terminal, not only in Tehran but in Herat, Afghanistan; Sulaimaniyah, Iraq; Istanbul, Turkey; and Canada. This was unacceptable, and we mostly put an end to these practices.\n\nAl-Monitor: At the time of the currency's fall, there were some unofficial reports in Iran about the role of the United Arab Emirates in rial depreciation, as it was whispered in political circles that Abu Dhabi had closed down Iran's exchange stores. Do you think the UAE played a role in the rial's depreciation?\n\nHemmati: I also heard about these rumors. Some were also claiming that Saudi Arabia intervened in the foreign exchange markets in Sulaimaniyah and Herat. These were mere rumors, but the fact was that the UAE did, in fact, put restrictions on private Iranian foreign exchange bureaus as well as Iranian accounts in UAE banks. However, I have recently heard that some of those restrictions have been lifted, which is something that we, as neighbors, expect our neighbors to do.\n\nAl-Monitor: The rial's plunge and liquidity growth have sent inflation soaring. What steps are being taken to address this?\n\nHemmati: In the past few decades, the average growth of liquidity was around 20-23% [annually]. Therefore, the current liquidity growth of 23-24% is not a new issue. In my view, the key factor behind inflation was the exchange rate depreciation, which pushed up the prices of imported goods, including basic commodities and durable goods. Rising inflation continued until March 2019. Since then, we have seen that inflation is cooling off, which is evident in recent monthly inflation rates. Once we successfully curbed exchange rate depreciations, we were able to rein in inflationary pressures. As you well know, at the height of the recent sanctions, one US dollar was traded at around 20,000 rials. Today, it is about 11,400 rials, which translates into an almost 40% appreciation. We will continue to see further easing of inflation in the coming months. I must add that we are planning to apply a tool to manage liquidity, namely through open market operations. This is something that most ENTITYs do, and we will also use it to the full extent.\n\nAl-Monitor: Is there a gradual process in place to unify the black market and official exchange rates?\n\nHemmati: What you are talking about is the process to integrate the \""cash\"" market with the rest of the [foreign exchange] market. This is already underway and will soon be completed. Now, we have two regulated systems: the NIMA system, which covers bank drafts and large transactions, and the cash market, which will converge with the larger foreign exchange market.\n\nAl-Monitor: People on the street are complaining about the dire state of the economy, and many have been forced to leave Tehran to live in suburbs as a result of the current economic situation. Moreover, there are many people who have emigrated or transferred their money to other countries such as Turkey and Georgia. What is your opinion on this matter? What is the solution to remedy these problems?\n\nHemmati: We have always said that Trump's unlawful action to renew unilateral sanctions has severely affected the most vulnerable and the poor. Should these sanction pressures continue, the poor would be the most harmed. However, the government is attempting to help them through protective measures. With the decline in oil revenues, the government budget is under pressure, but the government is committed to protecting the most vulnerable segments of society.\n\nOn the issue of capital outflow, I must say that cheap foreign exchange was a form of subsidy for those who wanted to move their assets abroad. I understand that when the exchange rate was about 37,000 rials, some people purchased real estate in Canada and were able to cover their mortgage payments with their domestic deposit interests; this is not possible anymore. In fact, we used to offer subsidies to people who purchased real estate in the United States, Canada, Georgia and Turkey. The adjustment of the exchange rate helped decelerate the process substantially.\n\nAl-Monitor: Is the ENTITY worried about the collapse of some of the private banks in Iran? If yes, what are you doing to prevent such events?\n\nHemmati: We are not worried, but we are vigilant. We know that some banks have difficulties in their balance sheets, but we are monitoring them and providing support in case they need it. With the new powers granted to the ENTITY, the troubled banks and credit unions will be effectively supervised and managed. We have a long-term program for banking system reforms.\n\nAl-Monitor: Has this happened yet?\n\nHemmati: Yes, we have taken over three credit unions and started the reforms.\n\nAl-Monitor: A few banks belonging to the military organizations were recently merged. Were they also on the verge of collapse?\n\nHemmati: Some of those banks even had a positive performance, but they were merged following the order of the Supreme Leader that the armed forces must withdraw from the banking sector. The process is going well and will be completed in the near future.\n\nAl-Monitor: EU officials have repeatedly spoken about transactions being done based on INSTEX, the special purpose vehicle launched by the Europeans in January to facilitate non-USD transactions that won't break US sanctions. What is the current status of INSTEX and have any transactions been made through it?\n\nHemmati: To not give the Europeans any pretext [for stalling this process], we established a corresponding company, named a managing director and pledged its required capital, even sooner than the Europeans. Only after a long delay of four months, the Europeans were ready and a $4 million transaction was made through INSTEX, by which we purchased medical equipment for one of the provinces. After that, no transaction has been performed. The Europeans always claim that it should first begin the work by goods that are not subject to sanctions, but INSTEX was launched exactly to facilitate transactions of sanctioned goods. Therefore, I am not sure that INSTEX will be an extraordinary and special vehicle for Iran.\n\nAl-Monitor: Why were no transactions made after the first one?\n\nHemmati: Because they didn't deposit any money into INSTEX. We told the Europeans that they should establish a credit line based on a pre-purchase agreement or make an outright purchase of our oil. Nonetheless, it seems that the United States has not allowed them, and the Europeans claim that, still, the United States is not letting them do so. My feeling is that the Europeans lack determination to act independently.\n\nAl-Monitor: So you mean you are not optimistic about INSTEX?\n\nHemmati: I have come to the conclusion that the issue is not with INSTEX and its mechanism. The issue is that the Europeans seem to need US approval for their plans. They have failed to find any solution to this problem. That is why I see no point to remain optimistic.\n\nAl-Monitor: Is there any news about the French $15 billion credit line, or has it reached a dead end?\n\nHemmati: France has put so much effort into this, and we had told them that we would accept it on the condition that they pre-purchased our oil. We want to export our oil, and if they do not want to purchase our oil, then I do not see any use for this. I must also add that $15 billion is not much compared to what we have been able to provide to our importers, which has totaled $20 billion since early April 2019. They wanted to take a step and prove that they were able to buy oil within the JCPOA framework; but despite their efforts, it turned out that the United States has not allowed them yet.\n\nAl-Monitor: You mean that the French proposal is gone with the wind?\n\nHemmati: It depends on the Europeans and the United States to work it out. Throughout the negotiations, they were saying that they would go on if the United States approved it, and the United States declared that it would not agree with it.\n\nAl-Monitor: Is it true that even the French ENTITY was not willing to guarantee the credit line?\n\nHemmati: No, all the issues were discussed between the representatives of the Iranian ENTITY and French, German and British officials. However, they simply made everything subject to US approval.\n\nAl-Monitor: Is the door still open for negotiations to save the JCPOA?\n\nHemmati: The president of the Islamic Republic of Iran announced that if Iran were to negotiate with the United States within the framework of JCPOA and P5 + 1, the US sanctions should be lifted.\n\nAl-Monitor: On the issue of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which has extended Iran's deadline a few times, is it true that Russian and Chinese banks have warned Iran that they will not accept to have any financial transaction with Tehran if FATF puts Iran on the blacklist again?\n\nHemmati: Joining the FATF is one of the requirements of international banking transactions. So it is natural that all the banks would require compliance with FATF regulations."

Central Bank Of Iran,0,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Lebanon's Cabinet approved sweeping reforms on Monday, hoping to appease the thousands of protesters that have taken to the streets for the last five days to demand the government step down.\n\nPrime Minister Saad Hariri described the measures as a \financial coup,\"" saying no government in Lebanon's history has taken such steps before.\n\nAs Hariri's speech was aired live on all local TV stations, thousands of protesters who had gathered in central Beirut chanted: \""The people want to bring down the regime.\""\n\nHundreds of thousands participated in marches Sunday in Beirut and other cities nationwide. The massive protests have turned into a widening revolt against the country's sectarian status quo and the entire political elite. The outrage over the government's mismanagement of a deepening economic crisis and proposed new taxes has unified Lebanon's often fractious society.\n\nHariri had given his government -- an unwieldy national coalition of nine largely sectarian parties -- a deadline that expires Monday evening to come up with convincing solutions to the economic crisis.\n\nAfter a nearly five-hour emergency government meeting, Hariri told reporters that the Cabinet approved the 2020 budget with a deficit of 0.6 percent with no new taxes.\n\n\""The decisions that we made today might not fulfil your goals but for sure it achieves what I have been seeking for two years,\"" Hariri said. \""These decisions are not for exchange. I am not going to ask you to stop protesting and stop expressing your anger. This is a decision that you take.\""\n\n\""Frankly speaking, your protest is what made us to take these decisions that you witnessed today,\"" Hariri said. He added that \""what you did has broken all barriers and shook all political parties.\""\n\nHariri said that the salaries of top officials, including legislators and members of parliament, will be cut in half as part of an economic reform package. He added that the country's ENTITY and the banking sector, which are flush with cash, will help in reducing the deficit by about $3.4 billion in 2020.\n\nThe banking sector was criticized by many of the protesters, who blamed it for charging the state high interest rates as it carries much of the $85 billion public debt that stands at 150% of the gross domestic product. Some senior politicians are either owners or major shareholders in private banks and Hariri said taxes will be increased on financial institutions.\n\nThe Cabinet also approved abolishing several state institutions including the Ministry of Information and cutting the budget of other state agencies such as the one in charge of development and construction by 70%.\n\nThe government will also distribute millions of dollars to families living in poverty and will also give $160 million as housing loans in an attempt to try revive the struggling construction sector.\n\nHariri said that a law will be drafted to restore money that were usurped as a result of widespread corruption in the country.\n\nLater Monday, President Michel Aoun signed the budget, which will be sent to parliament for discussion and approval.\n\nEarlier, protesters closed major roads around Lebanon ahead of the emergency Cabinet meeting.\n\nDemonstrators placed barriers across major intersections in Beirut as well as other cities and towns across the country. Schools, universities, banks and government institutions remain shuttered as the country is gripped by the largest protests since the so-called Cedar Revolution in 2005.\n\nAmid the unrest, Lebanese troops were deployed on the main road to the palace to clear the way for Hariri and government ministers to reach Baabda.\n\nMany protesters say they don't trust any plan by the current government. They've called on the 30-member Cabinet to resign and be replaced by a smaller one made up of technocrats instead of members of political factions.\n\nThe protests are building on long-simmering anger at a ruling class that has divvied up power among themselves and amassed wealth for decades but has done little to fix a crumbling economy and dilapidated infrastructure.\n\n\""I am with the reforms. I am against the destruction of Lebanon,\"" said Rabih Zghaib a protester in Beirut. \""Lebanon has been badly damaged by the politicians for 30 years. Today their thrones are shaking.\""\n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif expressed hope that Lebanon's government and political parties pay \""attention to people's demands,\"" the semi-official Fars news agency reported.\n\nIt was the first remarks by an Iranian official about the protests in Lebanon.\n\nIran enjoys wide influence in Lebanon through the militant Hezbollah organization, which is armed and funded by Tehran.

Hizballah,1,"Brian H. Hook, Special Representative for Iran and Senior Policy Advisor to the Secretary of State\n\nChairman Risch, Ranking Member Menendez, distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify today, and thank you for devoting a hearing to discuss America's foreign policy to Iran.\n\nThis Administration has implemented an unprecedented pressure campaign with two primary objectives: First, to deprive the Iranian regime of the money it needs to support its destabilizing activities. Second, to bring Iran to the negotiating table to conclude a comprehensive deal, as outlined by Secretary Pompeo in May 2018.\n\nPresident Trump and Secretary Pompeo have expressed very clearly the United States' willingness to negotiate with Iran, and we are willing to meet with the Iranians without preconditions. No one should be uncertain about our desire for peace or our readiness to normalize relations should we reach a comprehensive deal. We have put the possibility of a much brighter future on the table for the Iranian people, and we mean it.\n\nThe comprehensive deal we seek with the Iranian regime should address four key areas: its nuclear program, its ballistic missile development and proliferation, its support to terrorist groups and proxies, and its arbitrary detention of U.S. citizens including Bob Levinson, Siamak Namazi, Xiyue Wang, and others.\n\nA year and a half ago, Secretary Pompeo laid out 12 points that expanded further on the kind of deal we are seeking with Iran. The requirements Secretary Pompeo laid out reflect the scope of Iran's malign behavior. It also reflects the longstanding global consensus as enshrined in multiple Security Council resolutions since Iran's nuclear violations were first addressed by the Council in 2006.\n\nBefore we exited the deal, re-imposed sanctions, and accelerated our pressure, Iran was increasing the scope of its malign activity. The Islamic Republic was strengthened by the resources and legitimacy provided by the nuclear deal. Under the deal, Iran was continuing to expand its missile testing and proliferation. We now have newly declassified information related to Iran's missile program that I can share today:\n\nBeyond continued advancements to its missile program, Iran was also deepening its engagement in regional conflicts.\n\nFurthermore, under the deal, Iran was given a clear pathway to import and export dangerous arms. Two days from now, on October 18th, we will be exactly one year away from the expiration of the UN arms embargo on Iran. Because of the Iran nuclear deal, countries like Russia and China will be able to sell conventional weapons to Iran. The Iranian regime will also be free to sell weapons to anyone. This will trigger a new arms race in the Middle East.\n\nThe moment Iran is allowed to buy advanced drones, missiles, tanks, and jets, it will do so. This will be a win for its proxies across the region, who will use such arms to then attack other nations on Iran's behalf. The United Nations Security Council needs to renew the arms embargo on Iran before it expires. We have made this a priority.\n\nUnder the Iran deal, the travel ban on 23 Iranian terrorists, including Qassem Soleimani, expires the same day as the arms embargo.\n\nConstraints on Iran will continue to unravel under the deal.\n\nOur Iran strategy is aimed at reversing these trends. Today, by nearly every measure, the regime and its proxies are weaker than when our pressure began and we are well on our way to restoring the strong international standards that had long guided the world's policy on Iran.\n\nShia militant groups in Syria have stated to the New York Times that Iran no longer has enough money to pay them as much as they have in the past. ENTITY and Hamas have enacted unprecedented austerity plans due to a lack of funding from Iran. In March, ENTITY's leader Hassan Nasrallah went on TV and said ENTITY needed public support to sustain its operations.\n\nWe are also making it harder for Iran to expand its own military capabilities. Beginning in 2014, Iran's military budget increased every year through to 2017, when it hit nearly $14 billion. However, from 2017 to 2018, when our pressure went into effect, we saw a reduction in military spending of nearly 10 percent. Iran's 2019 budget, which was released in March, called for even steeper cuts, including a 28 percent cut to their defense budget and a 17 percent cut for IRGC funding.\n\nThe IRGC's cyber command is now low on cash, and the IRGC has told Iraq's Shia militia groups that they should start looking for new sources of revenue. Now, because of our sanctions, Iran will be unable to even fully fund this skinny budget for 2019.\n\nIran's economy contracted by about 5 percent last year and this year will shrink by more than 10 percent. We estimate it could contract by as much as 14 percent, sending Iran into a deep depression. Iran is now tapping unconventional sources -- like privatizing state assets and drawing on its sovereign wealth fund -- to make up for the shortfall. Iran is being forced to choose between printing more money or delaying spending on infrastructure development, salaries, and benefits.\n\nIran has a choice: it can act like a country, or it can act like a cause. Iran must change its behavior and act like a normal nation or it will watch its economy crumble.\n\nOur policy is at its core an economic and diplomatic one. We are relying on economic pressure and the might of American diplomacy to raise the costs on Iran and force meaningful behavior change.\n\nIran, however, has responded to this policy with violence. In recent months, Iran has launched a series of attacks in a panicked bid to intimidate the world into halting our pressure. Iran was responsible for the attacks at the Port of Fujairah, the assault on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, and the attack on Saudi oil facilities at Abqaiq.\n\nIran should meet diplomacy with diplomacy, not with terror, bloodshed, and extortion. Our diplomacy does not entitle Iran to undertake violence against any nation or to threaten maritime security.\n\nThis Administration does not seek armed conflict with Iran. We have been equally clear to the regime that we will defend our citizens, forces, and interests, including against attacks by Iran or its proxies.\n\nWe stand with our partners and allies to safeguard global commerce and regional stability, and have taken appropriate steps to enhance the regional defense architecture. Our aim is to deter conflict and support our partners.\n\nThe Islamic Republic is also engaging in its longstanding practice of nuclear extortion. Iran's message to the international community is clear: if you do not allow us to conduct our normal level of terror, then we will behave even more badly until you do. It has long used its nuclear program in this way and for this reason. The world ought to recognize this extortion when it sees it.\n\nIran's recent accelerations of its uranium enrichment reminds us of the deficiencies of the Iran nuclear deal. Iran's nuclear threats are made possible by a plan that left Iran's nuclear capabilities largely intact and that seems to have encouraged Iran to dream of the day when key limits on its nuclear program would evaporate, allowing it to prepare for rapid breakout.\n\nI should also emphasize, Mr. Chairman, that the problems presented by Iran's provocative threats to begin building up its stocks of nuclear material - and the actions it is already taking to expand its uranium enrichment centrifuge research and development, and to produce more heavy water - are problems that the world would have faced anyway, in a few years' time, under the terms of the JCPOA itself.\n\nHad we stuck to the JCPOA until those dangerous Iranian provocations were actually permitted by the JCPOA, we would be less prepared to meet the threats Iran presents. In that intervening period, Iran would have continued on the trajectory it was on until the United States' re- imposition of sanctions pressures: amassing revenue from abroad because the deal encouraged business with Iran, while funneling maximum effort and money into missile development, missile proliferation, support for terrorism, and regional destabilization. The Iran we would have faced then would be much more formidable than the Iran we face today.\n\nWe must learn from past mistakes and demand comprehensive and permanent restrictions on Iran's activities in any new deal.\n\nWe can look to a recent tragedy to show nations can pressure Iran to change. When Sahar Khodayari, an Iranian woman, died from self- immolation after she was sentenced to prison simply for attending a soccer match in Tehran. Together with international outrage and condemnation, FIFA challenged the regime's policy of prohibiting women from attending matches. As a result of international pressure, Iran agreed to permit women to a match last week, even though the authorities kept the women segregated in a separate section.\n\nWhen the world comes together to push back against Iran, we see change in its behavior. This administration will do its part, and we are succeeding in having others join us. Late last month, France Germany, and the United Kingdom called for Iran to accept negotiations on its nuclear program, ballistic missiles, and regional activity. The E3 now agree with us that a new deal is needed. Secretary Pompeo and I have made clear to our allies and partners that we will continue to stand with them against Iran's violence.\n\nLooking forward, our pressure will continue to deny Iran access to the revenue streams it needs to destabilize the Middle East. As we raise the costs of Iran's expansionism and foreclose the possibility of prolonging the status quo, Iran will continue to find its violence will only earn it isolation and censure.\n\nWe seek a comprehensive deal that sets our two peoples on a new trajectory toward a far more peaceful and stable relationship. We remember that the longest suffering victims of the Iranian regime are the Iranian people. The last 40 years of Iran's history are a sad tale of corruption and the oppression of a once-vibrant people. The United States stands with the Iranian people in their deep desire that the next 40 years of Iran's history will not be stained by repression and fear of the clerics' cruelty. We wish nothing more for the Iranian people a future with by a truly representative government and friendship with the American people.\n\nChairman Risch, Ranking Member Menendez, and other Members of the Committee, I thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you. I welcome the opportunity to answer your questions."
Hizballah,1,"Faced with a bankrupt economy due to international sanctions over its illicit WMD and terrorist activities, Iran's regime faces a stark choice: Either it can stop wasting the nation's precious wealth on its regional aggressions or it can raise funds by increasing taxes and reducing services for an already impoverished nation. The regime has chosen the latter.\n\nThe mullahs' regional warmongering is coming at the cost of starvation and destitution for millions of Iranian citizens. But this is not a sustainable policy. Sooner or later, the nationwide protests over government corruption and overdue wages are bound to turn into an uprising for regime change.\n\nOn October 7, the regime's parliament held a session behind closed doors to discuss further decrease of subsidiaries on goods, particularly on fuel.\n\nOn October 8, the government announced a decrease of fuel rations from 30 liters to 20 liters for all citizens. Iranian society and Iran's economy are greatly dependent on fuel in order to function.\n\nFearing that sudden and complete removal of the state subsidiaries would result in an uprising, the regime is reducing them in stages. The regime has previously experienced huge protests over corruption and economic mismanagement.\n\nAlthough state subsidiaries are often meager sums, their reduction affects the lives of ordinary Iranians who count every single rial.\n\nAccording to the state-run Titr-e-Bartar news agency, the poverty line in Iran for a family of four persons is 80 million rials (around $500 US).\n\nDeputy Parliament Speaker Abdolreza Mesri on October 6 said: \Today, inflation is at 40%, and the poor have nothing to eat. Not a single rial has been added to the 1.6 million rial income of a family.\""\n\n\""Their income today is the same as last year: 1.6 million rials for a family of one and 5 million rials for a family of five, or 34,400 rials per day.\""\n\nMesri pointed out that the current cost of small-size bottled water is 15,000 rials. \""So with the income, we're giving people, they can drink one bottle in the morning, one at lunchtime and half a bottle at night.\""\n\n\""How can they cover housing, clothing, transportation, food, education, medical expenses and sanitation with 34,400 rials?\""\n\n\""And even that is being deprived of them. Where is all the money from the budget being spent?\""\n\nThe Iranian regime is aware that further pressure on the population could trigger a social uprising but since it is unwilling to stop wasting funds on regional wars and enriching the mullahs and Revolutionary Guards, it is forced to go down this path.\n\nRegime funds terrorism instead of resolving social-economic crises\n\nThe U.S. State Department in a report, \""OUTLAW REGIME: A CHRONICLE OF IRAN'S DESTRUCTIVE ACTIVITIES,\"" revealed that between 2012 and 2018 the regime ruling Iran has \""spent over $16 billion proppings up the Assad regime and supporting its other partners and proxies in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.\""\n\n\""Lebanese ENTITY is Iran's most powerful terrorist partner. In the past several years, it has demonstrated its far-reaching terrorist and military capabilities. Iran's annual financial backing to Lebanese ENTITY - a staggering $700 million per year - accounts for the overwhelming majority of the group's annual budget. Iran also provides up to $100 million annually in combined support to Palestinian terrorist groups, including Hamas, PIJ, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command,\"" the report added.\n\nWhile the regime uses the Iranian nation's wealth to pursue its terrorist agenda, the majority of Iranian people are living under the poverty line, and as the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) recently reported, the people are forced to sell their organs to cover their living expenses.\n\nAny incentive packages to the Iranian regime by European governments would only enable it to fund further terrorist attacks and enlarge its ballistic missile arsenal.\n\nIran's people, who are the primary victims of the regime, support international sanctions against their oppressors. They know that all money the regime receives from abroad is used to prolong its illegitimate rule. Since the U.S. reinstated sanctions on the regime last year, there has not been a single popular protest in Iran denouncing international sanctions. Instead, there have been thousands of protests, large and small, against the regime's corruption, economic mismanagement and suppression - many of which have ended with calls for regime change."
Hizballah,1,"It is note-worthy that Saab's nine-count indictment includes felonies under the Immigration and Nationality Act, for engaging in immigration fraud, including naturalization fraud in that he is alleged to have lied about his involvement with Hezbollah when he applied for naturalization and subsequently became a United States citizen.\n\nHe's a naturalized U.S. citizen admitted lawfully nearly 20 years ago\n\nBy: Michael Cutler\n\nA \sleeper\"" is an alien who, in one way or another, manages to enter the United States, either legally or illegally, and then maintains a low profile, hiding in plain sight until he/she is called into action to carry out terror attacks or support terror attacks in the United States.\n\nOften sleeper agents may also conduct surveillance, amass supplies or otherwise engage in preparatory functions for future deadly terror attacks.\n\nOn September 19, 2019 the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York issued a press release entitled, \""Manhattan U.S. Attorney Announces Indictment Of New Jersey Man For Terrorist Activities On Behalf Of ENTITY's Islamic Jihad Organization.\"" The subtitle of that press release provides more disturbing information. Alexei Saab Allegedly Was Trained by ENTITY's External Terrorist Operations Component in Bomb-Making and Conducted Intelligence-Gathering in New York City and Washington, D.C., and Elsewhere in Support of ENTITY's Attack-Planning Efforts.\n\nThe Department of Justice also issued a press release on September 19, 2019 about this case.\n\nIt is note-worthy that Saab's nine-count indictment includes felonies under the Immigration and Nationality Act, for engaging in immigration fraud, including naturalization fraud in that he is alleged to have lied about his involvement with Hezbollah when he applied for naturalization and subsequently became a United States citizen. Saab is also alleged to have entered into a fraud marriage for the purpose of providing another alien terrorist co-conspirator with U.S. citizenship in furtherance of their terrorist goals. U.S. citizenship provides the \""keys to the kingdom.\""\n\nThe official report, 9/11 and Terrorist Travel included these two excerpts about the clear nexus between immigration fraud and terrorism:\n\nOnce terrorists had entered the United States, their next challenge was to find a way to remain here. Their primary method was immigration fraud. For example, Yousef and Ajaj concocted bogus political asylum stories when they arrived in the United States. Mahmoud Abouhalima, involved in both the World Trade Center and landmarks plots, received temporary residence under the Seasonal Agricultural Workers (SAW) program, after falsely claiming that he picked beans in Florida.\n\n* * *\n\nTerrorists in the 1990s, as well as the September 11 hijackers, needed to find a way to stay in or embed themselves in the United States if their operational plans were to come to fruition. As already discussed, this could be accomplished legally by marrying an American citizen, achieving temporary worker status, or applying for asylum after entering. In many cases, the act of filing for an immigration benefit sufficed to permit the alien to remain in the country until the petition was adjudicated. Terrorists were free to conduct surveillance, coordinate operations, obtain and receive funding, go to school and learn English, make contacts in the United States, acquire necessary materials, and execute an attack.\n\nIn point of fact, several years ago I wrote an extensive article about the nexus between immigration fraud and terrorism. My article was entitled, Immigration Fraud: Lies That Kill-9/11 Commission identified immigration fraud as a key embedding tactic of terrorists.\n\nBefore we delve further into this case we must connect some very important dots. Today the United States is attempting to thwart Iran's efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. Iran is the world's most prolific and dangerous state sponsor of terrorism. Hezbollah is a terrorist organization that is funded and directed by Iran.\n\nAwhile back I wrote a commentary about a Congressional hearing that focused on the threats posed by sleeper cells to the United States. My piece, Congressional Hearing: Iranian Sleeper Cells Threaten U.S. provided information disclosed at the hearing and also included a link to The Washington Free Beacon report about the hearing under the unambiguous headline, Iranian-Backed 'Sleeper Cell' Militants Hibernating in U.S., Positioned for Attack.\n\nNow that we have put the case of the defendant in the case, Alexei Saab, a/k/a \""Ali Hassan Saab,\"" a/k/a \""Alex Saab,\"" a/k/a \""Rachid,\"" into proper context in terms of the broader issue of the national security / public safety threats posed by Hezbollah and other terrorist sleeper agents operating inside the United States, we need to go back and take a closer look at facts and allegation provided in the federal Criminal Complaint and Criminal Indictment as provided in the above-noted press releases.\n\nTo begin with, according to the allegations, Saab joined Hezbollah in 1996 and legally entered the United States nearly 20 years ago, in 2000. There was no mention as to the visa he used to enter the United States but it was disclosed that he applied for U.S. citizenship in 2005 and was subsequently naturalized in 2008.\n\nIn 2005 he traveled to Turkey to receive training in weapons, explosives and surveillance techniques and to be debriefed by his handlers about the results of his surveillance of potential terror targets in New York City, Washington, DC and elsewhere and that during one of his trips outside the United States he tried, unsuccessfully, at Hezbollah's direction, to kill a man they believed to be an Israeli intelligence agent.\n\nFor nearly 20 years this sleeper agent lived quietly among his neighbors in New Jersey. How-ever, his ultimate goal was to participate in a deadly terror attack to slaughter many victims.\n\nIf not for the work of the law enforcement officers who ultimately, through information provided by an informant, it is entirely possible that he would have gone on to carry out a deadly attack.\n\nSaab is only the latest of many alien sleepers who have been discovered and arrested.\n\nFor example, on June 8, 2017 the Department of Justice issued a press release, Two Men Arrested for Terrorist Activities on Behalf of ENTITY's Islamic Jihad Organization.\n\nHowever, how many more terrorists are still living among us, waiting for their instructions calling upon them to carry out deadly terror attacks?\n\nGlobalists and immigration anarchists vilify ICE agents and insist that it is unfair to arrest aliens who have no serious criminal histories.\n\nAs a rule, sleeper agents do not have criminal histories. This is a significant part of their methodology. It has been said that a good spy is someone who would not attract the attention of a waiter or waitress at a \""greasy spoon diner.\""\n\nThe same can be said of an effective sleeper agent. In point of fact, that waiter or waitress might well be a spy or a terrorist.\n\nThe threats are real, yet the leaders of the Democratic Party insist that we throw open our borders and stop enforcing our immigration laws. Sanctuary cities shield some truly dangerous aliens.\n\nThe second largest contingent of federal agents who are assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) are immigration law enforcement officers because, as we see in this case, alien terrorists invariably violate our immigration laws.\n\nThe best way of uncovering immigration fraud is not to pass more laws but to hire more agents who can conduct those vital investigations. Political leaders from both political parties have advocated a massive program to legalize unknown millions of illegal aliens in the United States.\n\nThere would be no way to interview those illegal aliens, let alone conduct field investigations. Such a program would irrevocably undermine national security and constitute an act of national suicide."
Hizballah,1,"Washington, DC (STL.News) - The US Department of State released the following statement:\n\n(Via interpreter) Good morning, and welcome to this joint press conference. We'll be having some brief statements by Minister Di Maio and followed by Secretary Pompeo, and then we'll be taking two questions from the Italian press and two from the U.S. press.\n\n(In English.) (Inaudible) brief statements, and then we'll take questions by two Italian journalists first, and then by two U.S. journalists. Minister Di Maio.\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER DI MAIO: (Via interpreter) Thank you, Giovanni. Thank you, everybody, for being here. A very warm welcome to Mr. Secretary of State Pompeo. Thank you very much for being here. Welcome to Villa Madama. Thank you for your visit, and thank you for having chosen to travel to Abruzzo following these institutional meetings. Thank you for deciding to go for the first time to the town your ancestors came from.\n\nI am very happy to have had this opportunity to meet. And as I reiterated to Secretary Pompeo, Italy is an ally of the United States. We are part of the Atlantic alliance, and we wish to be protagonists within the Atlantic alliance. We want to be protagonists within NATO. We want to be protagonists and stimulating our age-old alliance towards new challenges, new diplomatic challenges - challenges which, of course, have to do with our country's stability, growth, and economic and social growth.\n\nIt was a real pleasure for me to be able to discuss some important issues with you, issues which are at the very core of our concerns, of course; issues such as the crisis in the Mediterranean, with a special focus on Libya. We talked about the stability of Libya, which is an essential dossier as far as we're concerned. And it isn't just linked to our concerns of migration. It's also linked to our concerns with a possible terrorist risk. You all know that Libya is very close to Italy. Its territorial waters are waters in which sometimes our fishing boats go into, and therefore it is a region which is very close to us, to Sicily, to our borders. And I think it will be - it'll be very important to be able to meet at the Berlin conference. That's a conference we're already working on. And the role of the United States will be very important in the work we can do together as a way of stimulating all of the players involved in Libya to move towards a ceasefire without fostering any kind of tension, without any kind of escalation. In fact, we wish to work towards a de-escalation of things.\n\nAnd as I was mentioning to Secretary Pompeo, I am also very much concerned about the topic of tariffs. We're concerned because we have a number of companies in Italy which survive thanks to their exports. They're the ones which export the very best in wine and agri-food, and in handmade products. That's what our companies live off of.\n\nAnd as I was explaining to Secretary Pompeo, in the past we used to export our industrial plants, whereas nowadays we want to focus on exporting our products while keeping our plants here and our jobs here. That's very important. In a moment in time in which the European economy's slowing down, our companies need to have certainties. And of course, one such certainty is our relationship with the U.S. It is a fundamental relationship. It isn't just one based on trade; it is one based on friendship, on our economies. And sometimes it's a relationship in which our products are destined to the U.S.\n\nAnd of course, we as a government will do whatever we can to try to defend made-in-Italy products and our exports globally. We want to defend our products of excellence, and we want to do everything we can so that we can increase our export capacity without reducing it. We want to make sure that our companies can export even more, because they do so much for our economy. And I'm referring to our entrepreneurs in the north, central, and southern Italy, and on our islands.\n\nAnd as a way of concluding before I leave the floor to the Secretary of State, Mr. Pompeo, obviously, currently we wish to deal with all of the international challenges within the framework of our Atlantic alliance, and we wish to deal with these challenges with the very best of the diplomatic spirit that have always - has always characterized us. Any solution to a crisis has to be diplomatic, it has to be peaceful, and that is something we will always work on together so that we can continue to bring about economic and social growth in our respective countries.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you, Foreign Minister Di Maio. Grazie. You have been a most gracious host. I had wonderful meetings with President Mattarella and Prime Minister Conte yesterday, truly excellent hospitality in the finest Italian tradition. I look forward to showing your president Italian-American hospitality when he comes to Washington in just a couple of weeks.\n\nThe - we're both smiling because the deep and abiding ties between the United States and Italy are very personal for me. As the foreign minister said, I'm one of 20 million Americans who proudly claim Italian heritage, and the first one ever to serve as Secretary of State. Tomorrow I'll get a chance to go visit my ancestral home in Abruzzo, and I'm looking forward to meeting all my cousins. (Laughter.) And I hear the food is worth meeting as well.\n\nWe had an excellent discussion today about the close cooperation that lies ahead for the United States and the new Italian Government. That cooperation will be well served by President Trump's already strong relationship with President Mattarella and Prime Minister Conte. But our true bonds come from the central shared value set, a commitment to the same principles of democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human dignity.\n\nI was pleased to affirm America's commitment in particular to religious freedom earlier this morning at a conference that was held at the Vatican. Our principles together have produced a security partnership that has helped underpin peace and stability in the West for decades. We're very grateful for what Italy has done and its active leadership in Libya and in North Africa, as well as in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I'm also grateful that 30,000 men and women of the United States military, DOD civilians, and their family members can call Italy their temporary home. You are wonderful hosts for them, and we appreciate that.\n\nI know too that we can do more together. We should keep using the U.S.-Italy Strategic Dialogue to find ways to improve stability on Europe's southern frontier and grow our security cooperation in the Mediterranean. And we should continue to stand united against Iranian aggression. European nations have begun to wake up to the fact that Iran is the aggressor, not the aggrieved, and the fact is also clear from Italy's decision not to renew Mahan Air's access to Italy, and we're very grateful for that.\n\nI've asked for Italy's support too, and we talked about today the necessary task of confronting Nicolas Maduro for his repression and the socialist mismanagement that has taken place in Venezuela. EU sanctions should be enforced against Russia until such time that the situation changes materially.\n\nAnd finally, Italy is a friend and a sovereign nation with a right to make its own choices, but as I have done in Budapest and Bangkok, I urge my Italian friends to see how China uses its economic power to cultivate political influence and erode sovereignty. I raise concerns about China's zero-sum predatory approach to trade and investment, and what it could mean throughout Europe and Africa and the world at large. These are complicated issues with no easy answers, but my obligation is to speak the truth about these threats, a set of common threats which will continue to create confidence in our two peoples, that our partnership between our two countries will remain strong and enduring.\n\nMODERATOR: (Via interpreter) We'll begin with the Italian journalist, Francesca Sforza, La Stampa.\n\nQUESTION: (Via interpreter) Minister Di Maio, Secretary Pompeo, as far as the Berlin conference on Libya is concerned, and given the violence by the - by General Haftar's troops in - over the past few hours and days, how does the U.S. intend to support Italy's approach when it comes to ending the violence and to promote a ceasefire? With which interlocutors do you intend to work with, and how?\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: So we had extensive discussions today - we had them with President Mattarella and Prime Minister Conte as well - about Libya. Our mission set is very similar. We recognize that the first and most important thing we need to do is take down the level of violence, achieve a ceasefire, to convince all the relevant parties that are on the ground there, as well as those that have been supporting them from the outside, that a political solution is the only one that provides any real opportunity to create an outcome in Libya that is remotely adequate for Italy, but most importantly, for the people of Libya as well.\n\nSo our mission set, alongside our Italian partners, is to convince all of the relevant parties that the political process must move forward. And I'm hopeful that, whether it's the Berlin conference or some of the other work that's going to take place over the coming weeks, that we can achieve that outcome.\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER DI MAIO: (Via interpreter) This topic was obviously one which was discussed during all the talks we had last week in New York during the UNGA. And we agree on the principle that in order for there to be a ceasefire, there should be no countries which stimulate this conflict on the one side and on the other. And the moral suasion that a country like Italy can have is very important on some of the players involved in the conflict, be they Libyan players or non-Libyan players. But of course, the role, the moral suasion that a world power like the U.S. can exercise is just as important.\n\nAnd we believe that the Berlin conference, if prepared adequately, and by involving the players in the conflict as much as possible, we feel that this can lead to a further step forward. Of course, the step forward has to lead to a ceasefire, and has to lead towards a political process that can lead to the stabilization of Libya.\n\nMODERATOR: (Via interpreter) Vincenzo Nigro, la Repubblica.\n\nQUESTION: (Via interpreter) Good morning. I'd like to ask both of you to discuss the Iran issue in greater detail.\n\nSecretary Pompeo, do you think that returning to a negotiation, be it a direct or indirect negotiation - we all read about the alleged phone call between President Trump and President Rouhani at the UN. But does the Department of State favor a renewal in talks? And is it willing to reduce this maximum sanctions policy against Iran?\n\nAnd then I'd also like to ask Minister Di Maio: In your introductory speech, you said that Italy continues to prefer a diplomatic and political discussion to most serious crises in the world. And as far as the Mediterranean is concerned, of course, the most serious crisis is the Iranian one. Secretary Pompeo also mentioned Mahan Air, an Iranian airline company. I didn't understand if Italy will be willing to sanction that airline, too.\n\nAnd one final remark: Today, I think, is - marks the anniversary of the killing of the Saudi journalist, Mr. Khashoggi. Do you think that that murder will have an influence on the way in which our governments looks towards the main players in the Middle Eastern region?\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER DI MAIO: (Via interpreter) Let me start answering by saying that it's obvious, it's clear that we agree on the fact that as far as the Italian Government is concerned, but more generally speaking, the approach to any crisis has to be one which tends towards a de-escalation of things. Of course, that doesn't mean being neutral towards a region in which certain tensions exist, and Italy is concerned about these tensions.\n\nAs far as the Mahan Air dossier is concerned, in the next few days, I imagine the authorities which deal with air routes will be delivering (inaudible) decisions.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Our policy has been consistent for the now two and a half years of the Trump administration. The Islamic Republic of Iran is the world's largest state sponsor of terror and the primary destabilizing force throughout the Middle East. Our strategy has been to deny them the wealth and resources that they have used for 40 years now to conduct assassination campaigns right here in Europe; to engage with militias all around the world; to disrupt and gain political influence; to conduct terror campaigns around the world, and, as we've seen in the last half-dozen months, take European ships off the water in the Straits of Hormuz; to conducting attacks into Saudi Arabia; taking over 5 percent of the world's energy supply off the market. This is the Iran that the world confronts, and the United States and Iran confront it - excuse me, the United States and Italy confront it together.\n\nOur theory is working. ENTITY has fewer resources today than it did before. The Iranian leadership is having to make difficult decisions about resource allocation inside of their own country. And we remain hopeful that there will be an opportunity to discuss with the Iranians the path forward. We - President Trump has said repeatedly we are working every day to deter, with the maritime initiative that we have in the Strait of Hormuz, to de-escalate and to create opportunities for diplomacy. That's the approach that we have taken. It's the one that we'll continue to take.\n\nQUESTION: Hi, thank you. Mr. Secretary, sorry, this is going to be the second time in a week I have to ask you about something that's going on in Washington while we're not in Washington. This relates to the Ukraine situation and what's going on on the Hill.\n\nFirst of all, is it correct that you were on the phone call that President Trump had with President Zelensky on July 25th? And if so, are the accounts that we have all seen of it, including the transcript or partial transcript released by the White House, accurate and complete? And if you were on the call, did you hear anything on that in the conversation that raised a red flag, anything inappropriate or anything that gave you any concerns?\n\nAnd then secondly, you told - you said last week that you - as far as you knew, everyone at the State Department had acted appropriately in regards to Ukraine, including yourself. And so I'm - is that still the case? Is that still your belief? If it is, why object to the demand for deposition from the House committees on the Hill? And then do you have any concerns at all about what the State Department inspector general is going to be briefing to Hill staffers later today? Thank you very much.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Thanks, Matt. I'll try to answer questions four through seven first, and then one through three after that.\n\nBack to first principles. Your - the predicate of your final question about objecting to what the folks on Capitol Hill have asked is fundamentally not true. What we objected to was the demands that were put that are - deeply violate fundamental principles of separation of powers. They contacted State Department employees directly, told them not to contact legal counsel at the State Department. That's been reported to us. They said that the State Department wouldn't be able to be present. There are important constitutional prerogatives that the Executive Branch has to be present so that we can protect the important information so our partners, countries like Italy, have - can have confidence that the information that they provide to the State Department will continue to be protected.\n\nAnd so the response that I've provided to them was one that acknowledged that we will of course do our constitutional duty to cooperate with this co-equal branch, but we are going to do so in a way that is consistent with the fundamental values of the American system, and we won't tolerate folks on Capitol Hill bullying, intimidating State Department employees. That's unacceptable and it's not something that I'm going to permit to happen.\n\nAs for was I on the phone call? I was on the phone call. The phone call was in the context of - now, I guess I've been the Secretary of State for coming on a year and a half - I know precisely what the American policy is with respect to Ukraine. It's been remarkably consistent, and we will continue to try to drive those set of outcomes. It's what our team, including Ambassador Volker, we're focused on - was taking down the threat that Russia poses there in Ukraine. It was about helping the Ukrainians to get graft out and corruption outside of their government, and to help now this new government in the Ukraine build a successful, thriving economy. It's what the State Department officials that I've had the privilege to lead have been engaged in, and it's what we will continue to do, even while all this noise is going on.\n\nMS ORTAGUS: Okay. Chris O'Dea, National Review.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you both for being here. I'd like to, I guess, address the question to both of you. You can kind of take it in whichever order, whoever wants to kind of go first. Primarily oriented towards, I guess, what is conveniently termed kind of the Belt and Road these days, but in a - on a somewhat broader basis, not just with Huawei, but does the U.S. have any specific plans in terms of how to counter China's investment in these major critical infrastructure assets? And I ask that here because it seems like there is a very wide degree of those assets that are financed or operated in Italy by Chinese companies, and particularly in Port San Vito, obviously, and Trieste under the new BRI memorandum that was signed - bridges, roads, and highways as well.\n\nSo it seems like a great deal of Italy's economic infrastructure is kind of moving in a direction of sort of Chinese influence and the, I guess, underlying point is those types of things tend to require the Chinese companies to work very closely with Italian Government and financial institutions and get more deeply embedded in the way decisions are made and the way budget and resources are allocated.\n\nMS ORTAGUS: Okay. Thanks, Chris. Thanks.\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER DI MAIO: (Via interpreter) Well, I'm happy to answer, and of course, thank you very much for your question. In recent days, we have absorbed all of the department for foreign trade into the ministry for foreign affairs. I said this at the beginning, and I want to reiterate this in the presence of Secretary Pompeo: We are allies of the United States, and we share their concerns on certain strategic infrastructure, such as 5G for instance. And the concerns our allies have, and the information and the concerns of our authorities have led to new legislation here in Italy, making us one of the most advanced countries in terms of 5G security compared to the rest of Europe.\n\nWe have created a new golden power as far as 5G is concerned. We have recently approved a new decree which has immediately come into force, allowing us to define the cybersecurity framework as far as our country is concerned. And at the same time, we also have a committee which we have set up which will be assessing the accurate functioning of all of the systems being installed within our strategic infrastructure.\n\nNow, I want to say this because I want to make a clear distinction between our commercial MOUs, our trade MOUs, from our political concerns and our concerns vis-a-vis strategic infrastructure. And hopefully in the future we will be able to increasingly strengthen the relations and the agreements between the U.S. and Italy to secure our strategic infrastructure. We have no intention of signing trade agreements that can endanger our state's sovereignty. We are very careful whenever we sign trade agreements. We make sure that we include any possible guarantee so that European legislation is complied with, and so that the European principles are complied with, the principles with which we regulate our trade relations with other non-EU countries.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: I'd just add - we talked about this quite a bit, both yesterday and today - when China or Chinese companies show up and are prepared to compete on a fair, reciprocal basis, Italian companies, American companies will compete and will be incredibly successful. And we brook no ill towards those opportunities. It's when the Chinese Communist Party shows up under the guise of a commercial endeavor with an aim to really make an investment that is aimed - a political outcome, to gain political influence, to gain political power, or to threaten the nation's national security.\n\nThose are the things that every sovereign nation must protect against, and it's the kind of projects that I'm confident that I know the Italians will evaluate carefully and every European country will. They want to protect their people. They want to protect their citizens' data going across their systems from the Chinese Communist Party having access to that information. These are a set of shared threats, shared concerns not only with the United States and Italy, but the United States and all European nations.\n\nWhat President Trump has asked on the trade front is simply that China compete on a fair, reciprocal basis, that we get a set of trade agreements that permit that, that we get protections for basic private property rights, we can prevent China from stealing intellectual property. We don't - we no more want them to steal Italian intellectual property than we do American intellectual property. And I'm very confident that our two countries will work closely together to get those same set of outcomes that I know every Italian citizen and every American citizen wants as well. Thanks.\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER DI MAIO: Thank you very much.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. It was great to be with you."

Hizballah,1,"President Mauricio Macri of Argentina (left) became the first Latin American leader to designate Hezbollah a terrorist organization in July. Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benitez (right) became the second a few weeks later.\n\nThe counterterrorism conversation in Latin America is changing. On July 16, the Macri government of Argentina made history by becoming the first country in Latin America to officially designate Hezbollah a terrorist organization.\n\nLess than one month later, on August 9, the Paraguayan government followed suit and also officially recognized Hezbollah as a terror organization. Now, at least two other countries in the region are seriously considering issuing the same counterterrorism designation in the near future.\n\nRegardless of how long it takes, the proverbial train has left the station in Latin America and regional governments are waking up to the fact that Hezbollah is a terror threat in the Western hemisphere.\n\nLatin America is waking up to the fact that Hezbollah is a terror threat in the Western hemisphere.\n\nIt is important to note that these policy shifts do not happen in a vacuum. Regional counterterrorism cooperation is catalyzed by conversations that take place behind the scenes about Iran and Hezbollah's malign influence in the region. I have been fortunate enough to take part in some of these conversations, and here are the top five takeaways:\n\n1. Financial intelligence and oversight are paramount.\n\nDuring the recent Hezbollah terror designation in Argentina, the role of its financial intelligence unit was imperative in shaping internal government perspectives on Hezbollah and establishing the legal mechanisms for making the formal designation.\n\nMariano Federici, the head of Argentina's Financial Intelligence Unit\n\nOne year prior to the formal designation, the Financial Intelligence Unit of Argentina (Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera or UIF-AR by its Spanish acronym), led by Mariano Federici, froze the assets of 14 individuals belonging to the Barakat Clan, a powerful Lebanese crime family with ties to Hezbollah. One of the conduits for these Hezbollah money launderers was a casino in the city of Iguazú on the Argentine side of the Tri-Border Area (TBA). The UIF press release stated that \clan members allegedly collected money at the casino in Iguazú for fake prizes totaling more than $10 million, without declaring the funds when crossing the border.\"" This Argentine action on July 11, 2018 was more than symbolic: it was a legal precedent to prove that Hezbollah's financiers and facilitators are still active in Argentina.\n\nThis successful financial intelligence operation, coordinated with the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), was the first government action taken by President Mauricio Macri against Hezbollah. One year later, on July 16, 2019, President Macri signed Executive Decree 489, officially creating the \""Public Registry of Persons and Entities linked to Terrorism and its Financing\"" or RePET, by its Spanish acronym. The registry has been filled with more than 1,000 entries, many of them members, facilitators, or financiers of Hezbollah.\n\nIn the U.S. the Treasury Department, through its Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, led by Assistant Secretary Marshall Billingslea, has made historic advances, sanctioning more than 50 Hezbollah-related persons or entities since 2017 as part of a larger effort at dismantling Hezbollah's global financial network. The synchronization of these efforts by the U.S. and Argentina is a model for understanding how FIUs are a valuable tool to help regional governments build cases against Hezbollah in Latin America.\n\n2. Countering the convergence of crime and terror is critical.\n\nWhile Latin America may be relatively new to the intricacies involved in combatting Islamist terrorism, the region is certainly not new to countering transnational organized crime (CTOC). In most countries in Latin America, in fact, CTOC is among their top national security priorities. That is why, when the Department of Justice (DOJ), on October 15, 2018, designated Hezbollah as one of the world's top five transnational criminal organizations, many Latin American governments turned their attention to Hezbollah's illicit networks.\n\nLatin American governments are focusing more attention on Hezbollah's transnational criminal networks.\n\nThe relatively new Hezbollah Financing Narcoterrorism Team (HFNT) at the U.S. Department of Justice, led by Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Cronan, is doing critical work coordinating Hezbollah-related prosecutions across the country, and assisting foreign prosecutors in Latin America through training opportunities and workshops.\n\nOne of these training opportunities took place a month before Argentina designated Hezbollah as a terror organization, on June 12, 2019, when the U.S. and Argentina teamed up for a two-day workshop on Hezbollah. Law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and financial practitioners from six countries in South America traveled to Buenos Aires to discuss various techniques to constrain and counter Hezbollah's illicit activities. These efforts are led in Argentina by Security Minister Patricia Bullrich, who has also partnered with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in examining the convergence of crime and terror.\n\nThe National Defense University (NDU) has provided the intellectual horsepower on the topic and has already published two books on it. On July 15-16, 2019, the week of the 25th commemoration of Iran's bombing of the Jewish community center, AMIA, in Argentina, NDU's regional center, the William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies, partnered with Minister Bullrich and her team at the Argentine Ministry of Security for a workshop on the convergence of crime and terror, in which Hezbollah's role in Latin America was discussed at length. The approach of discussing Hezbollah as equal parts of crime and terror, allows the U.S. and Latin America to gain a full picture of the organization's transnational threat.\n\n3. Regional forums on counterterrorism cooperation are key.\n\nFor the past two years in Latin America, the Trump administration has been spearheading counterterrorism conferences, workshops, and events that allow the governments of the region to interact with one another and share their best practices on countering Hezbollah's crime and terror networks.\n\nDelegates of the First Hemispheric Counterterrorism Ministerial Conference assemble in Washington, DC, on December 11, 2018.\n\nA series of ministerial counterterrorism conferences have proven to be among the most prominent in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe first ministerial conference on counterterrorism in many years took place on December 11, 2018, when senior officials from 13 countries in Latin America came to Washington D.C. to work together to address regional gaps to counter terrorist threats. As U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan said at the time:\n\n[T]ransnational terrorism poses an immediate threat to us here in the Western Hemisphere. Although the perceived center of gravity seems far away, groups like ISIS, al-Qa'ida, and Lebanese ENTITY operate where they can find recruits, raise support, operate unchecked, and pursue their terrorist agendas.\n\nLater in his speech, Deputy Secretary Sullivan called on our regional partners to do more as \""our safety depends on working with all of you [in Latin America] on security as we continue to improve our own.\""\n\nDeputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan\n\nHis call was answered at the Second Hemispheric Counterterrorism Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires, on July 19, 2019, when an additional five countries joined the event, and Brazil moved from being an observer to a member. At the Second Ministerial Conference, 18 regional governments signed a joint communiqué on counterterrorism cooperation, acknowledging, and expressing concern for, Hezbollah's regional presence. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended to show solidarity with Argentina's terror designation of Hezbollah and encourage other regional governments also to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. Colombia will host the third ministerial counterterrorism conference, scheduled to take place in Bogota in mid-January 2020.\n\nIt did not take long for the impact of these summits to prompt Argentina's neighbors. Just a few weeks after it, on August 9, 2019, Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benitez signed Executive Decree 2307, officially recognizing Hezbollah as a terrorist organization in Paraguay, and accentuating the Lebanese terror group's presence in the Tri-Border Area (TBA). Later that month, on August 22, 2019, regional officials traveled to the TBA for the inaugural inter-agency Trinational Security Conference in Foz do Iguaço, Brazil. All of the senior actors involved in designating Hezbollah a terror group in Argentina and Paraguay took part in it, as did important security officials from Brazil's Ministry of Justice and Federal Police, thereby placing additional impetus on Brazil also to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.\n\n4. Congressman and Parliamentarians shape the narrative.\n\nMany regional forums helped shape the narrative and increased cooperation in countering terrorism in Latin America, prior to the official ministerial conferences. Among the most significant was the Parliamentary Intelligence Security Forum (PISF), organized by Robert Pittenger, a former Congressman from North Carolina. Congressman Pittenger has been organizing the PISF for several years; he held the first regional forum in Buenos Aires on November 21, 2016, with the UIF and the National Congress of Argentina. It was at this 2016 forum, almost three years ago, that initial conversations took place about the need to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization in Argentina.\n\nThe author of this article, Joseph M. Humire, speaks at the Parliamentary Intelligence Security Forum in Asuncion, Paraguay, on January 14, 2019.\n\nFast forward a few years, and a more recent regional PISF was in Asuncion, Paraguay, on January 14, 2019; it was this event that prompted Paraguay's recent terror designation of Hezbollah. Above all, the parliamentarians who attended these forums worked diligently to help fellow legislators in their countries understand the legal vacuum in Latin America regarding international terrorism.\n\nThis was certainly true for Argentine Congressman Luis Petri, the head of the National Security Commission in the Argentine Congress, who worked closely with Macri's government to find the political and legal path toward designating Hezbollah a terror organization. Prior to the designation, Congressman Petri carefully communicated the Macri government's efforts with regional and extra-regional allies, and after the designation, amplified the news in Brazil, Paraguay, and the United States.\n\nCongressman Petri also took part in the initial PISF in 2016, the ministerial in Buenos Aires in 2019, and recently presented at the Trinational Security Conference in Foz do Iguaço, Brazil, as well as an event organized by the Center for a Secure Free Society (SFS) at the U.S. Senate. His efforts have been vital in shaping the narrative as to why the terror designation of Hezbollah is important for Latin America.\n\n5. Public awareness and education are needed to ensure that the designations are sustainable.\n\nArgentine President Macri's leadership and political will have succeeded in establishing tremendous momentum for other Latin American governments to think critically about Hezbollah, as evidenced in President Abdo's recognition of the Lebanese terror group in Paraguay last month.\n\nAdditional designations may be coming from President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil (left) and President Ivan Duque of Colombia.\n\nAt this moment, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, and President Ivan Duque of Colombia, are working potentially to designate Hezbollah in their own countries for what it is -- a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nWhat happens, however, when political winds shift, and new politicians come to power in Latin America who may have less political will to tackle this problem?\n\nThat is why it is incredibly important to raise the public's awareness and educate Latin Americans on the nature of Hezbollah's crime and terror networks. Several efforts have been made for several years by like-minded non-governmental organizations and think tanks, such as the Gatestone Institute, Middle East Forum, Fuente Latina, Foundation for Defense of Democracies, American Foreign Policy Council, and many more, that have been at the forefront of catalyzing a region-wide conversation on the issue. I also have worked diligently alongside these organizations and with my own, the Center for a Secure Free Society (SFS), to educate Latin American leaders and the public on the transnational terror threat that Hezbollah poses to their countries, but far more needs to be done.\n\nMalcolm Hoenlein, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, emphasized this point in a moving speech at a recent SFS event on Capitol Hill when he reminded us that \""while Jews are often the first victims [of Hezbollah attacks] we are never the last...\"" The AMIA attack may have taken place 25 years ago, it may be perceived as simply an attack on Jewish-Argentines, not the country of Argentina. But this is wrong. The AMIA attack serves to remind us that the threat is close to home, and recent Hezbollah-related cases in Peru and Paraguay show that their terror actions in Latin America are far from over.\n\nThe time is long overdue for Latin America to catch up to the world in counterterrorism cooperation against Hezbollah.\n\nThe recent designations in Argentina and Paraguay of Hezbollah as a terrorist group are just the beginning. A window is open for other Latin American countries to follow in their footsteps and now, thanks to Argentina, we have a roadmap for how to do it. 2019 is critical because as political winds often shift in Latin America, the momentum throughout the region must not be stopped.\n\nThe time is long overdue for Latin America to catch up to the world in counterterrorism cooperation to stop Hezbollah from taking root and spreading its influence in our hemisphere.\n\nJoseph M. Humire is the executive director of the Center for a Secure Free Society (SFS), a fellow at the Middle East Forum, and a distinguished senior fellow at the Gatestone Institute."
Hizballah,1,"Yves here. This article presents Iran as having a grand strategy that is presently winning. The piece quotes recent statements from some of Iran's top officials and house organs. But an open question is how much of this is aspirational.\n\nThe reason for wondering whether the author has overstated his case is his depiction of the famed Houthi attack on Saudi oil facilities as \Iran-sponsored\"" is conjecture. As David pointed in out comments on Links yesterday:\n\nEscobar makes the same mistake that other commentators have made when he quotes the Merkel/Macron /Johnson statement on the attacks. Far from suggesting that Iran was 'definitively ' responsible for the attacks, the statement just says that the only 'plausible' interpretation is that Iran 'bears responsibility' for them. It doesn't suggest that Iran has sole responsibility, and it doesn't suggest the attacks came from Iran or were carried out by the Iranians. Statements like this are drafted with exquisite care, and if the three nations had evidence of direct Iranian involvement they would have said something different. Decoded, the statement says essentially ' we are pretty sure that the Iranians were involved in some way, but we are not sure how and we need to find out more.' The statement may merely allege that the Iranians agreed to the attacks, or even encouraged them. It may also mean that Iran gave the Houthis technical assistance or training. So in practice Escobar's source (who talks only about missiles, interestingly, not drones) isn't necessarily contradicting the European statement.\n\nBy Yossef Bodansky, the Director of Research at the International Strategic Studies Association (ISSA) and Senior Editor of Defense & Foreign Affairs publications (including the Global Information System: GIS) He was, for more than a decade, the Director of the US House of Representatives Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare. Originally published OilPrice\n\nThere was little doubt by late September 2019 that Iran's clerical leadership was truly in command of the dynamic of the transformation of the Persian Gulf region.\n\nThe crux of the Iranian regional strategy - including the Iran-sponsored rôle of the Houthi pre-dawned unmanned aerial vehicle strikes on Saudi Arabian oil facilities on September 14, 2019 - became increasingly clear as the shock of those strikes began to be absorbed.\n\nTehran was playing a masterful game, delicately balancing between its publicized confrontation with the US in the Persian Gulf and its real quest for a regional power status.\n\nThe Iran-proxy strike on Saudi Arabia and the ensuing threats to the US served both as a demonstration of the impotence of Saudi Arabia and its guardians, and as a diversion of attention away from the crucial and successful Iranian surge westward to the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Iranian declaratory threats of escalation remained focused on the Persian Gulf and particularly on warning the US against intervention. The Houthi strike reiterated anew the inherent vulnerability of Saudi Arabia, as well as its inability and unwillingness to act unilaterally against Iran. Tehran has long insisted that the US is reluctant to act against Iran, and every passing day reinforces the veracity of the Iranian message.\n\nHence, Tehran argues, all regional states and entities should take notice of the inherent power of Iran and Iran's proxies, as well as of the absence of US protection. Iran urges these states and entities to use the Houthi strike as an excuse to bring the current crisis to an end under conditions favorable to Iran.\n\nIranian Pres. Hassan Rouhani introduced the concept in the cabinet meeting of September 18, 2019. He explained that the Houthi strike was \""a warning to the enemies to end war and conflicts in the region\"". There was, he indicated, an urgent imperative to exploit and capitalize on the current shock. \""Enemies of the region should take lesson from this warning and should be after extinguishing the fire of war in the region to let the people live in freedom and welfare,\"" Rouhani said.\n\nIn a major speech delivered on September 22, 2019, Rouhani elaborated on the theme and now urged all the Persian Gulf states to reconcile with Iran and reject US intervention. Iran was ready to \""extend the hand of friendship and fraternity to all of its neighboring states\"" in the current \""critical and historic\"" juncture. \""In this regard, we are even ready to forgive their past mistakes, because today we are faced with conditions in which the enemies of the region, particularly the US, the arrogance and the Zionism, are seeking to exploit the gap, rift, and division among the regional countries,\"" Rouhani said.\n\nTime was of essence because \""enemies of Islam and the region seek to make the most out of our division\"". \""The presence of foreign forces can be dangerous for the region, international waters, as well as the security of shipping lines and energy, but [Iran's] path is to create unity and coordination with regional countries.\""\n\nRouhani questioned the sincerity of the US claim to be pursuing regional peace. \""If they [the Americans] are telling the truth, they'd better not turn the region into a stage of arms race,\"" he said, \""if they are after [establishing] security, they'd better get out of the region.\"" He further reminded the US of Iran's steadfast stand during the debilitating war with Iraq. Rouhani concluded that \""today's enemies of the country [should] think twice before deciding any attack on our soil and imposing another war on our nation. They don't have the courage to make a move against Iran's great armed forces and nation and will never find that courage.\""\n\nAs before, Tehran relied on ENTITY Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah to deliver the more explicit and threatening message.\n\nIn a sermon on September 20, 2019, Nasrallah analyzed the situation in the Persian Gulf. He noted that the world reaction to the Houthi strike \""clearly showed how expensive is oil once compared to blood. Saudi warplanes continue to kill Yemeni children, but no concrete action is taken (to stop the onslaught).\"" He stressed the futility of Riyadh's policies. \""Saudi Arabia is highly advised to stop the war on Yemen instead of seeking to purchase advanced air defense missile systems. All costly weapons purchased from the United States cannot protect you from drone attacks.\""\n\nHe warned Riyadh of US duplicity, explaining that \""Trump has commenced a new process of milking the Saudi kingdom. Trump is desperately seeking for a bilateral meeting with his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani.\"" Nasrallah emphasized the futility of confronting Iran and its allies. \""Continuing the war against Yemen with no [political] solution is pointless. You are starting to pay the price,\"" Nasrallah warned the Saudis. \""One strike knocked out half the oil production, and another strike, you can imagine what it will do,\"" he taunted.\n\n\""Don't bet on a war against Iran because they will destroy you. Your house is made of glass and your economy is made of glass. Like the glass cities in the UAE. ... You have already begun to pay the price of the war against Yemen.\"" Saudi Arabia \""should think well, as a war with Iran will mean their destruction.\"" Nasrallah concluded by reiterating the regional ramifications of the Houthi strike. \""This attack shows the strength of the Axis of Resistance,\"" Nasrallah said.\n\nIn a September 22, 2019, interview with Al-Alam TV, Nasrallah raised the ante by insisting that ENTITY had its own reasons for confronting the House of al-Sa'ud. He explained that the \""ruling regime of Saudi Arabia has got very old and is spending the last stages of its lifetime\"". Riyadh should not complain about its plight because this is a natural outcome of its long-term policies. \""In fact, Saudi Arabia was the initiator of hostility against Iran, and its problem with Iran was the same problem it had with other Arab countries, namely, [over] supporting the Palestinian issue and regional resistance movements,\"" Nasrallah said.\n\nGiven this background, Nasrallah said, \""this is not a proxy war and we believe that Saudi Arabia is hostile to [the] Lebanese resistance forces, regardless of Iran's position, so our problem with Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with Iran\"".\n\nThe next day, September 23, 2019, Iran's Press TV also published an interview with Nasrallah. He repeated his observation that \""the al-Sa'ud regime may be in the final stages of its life, and the incumbent rulers are expediting the regime's demise through their policies. ... [The] al-Sa'ud regime is old and may be in the final stages of its life because of natural reasons like its cruel measures over the past 100 years and the systematic corruption in the regime, suppression of people, and totalitarianism of its rules.\"" Nasrallah pointed to the growing anti-Saudi sentiments throughout the Arab World. \""We currently see for the first time that 'Death to al-Sa'ud' slogan is being chanted in several Arab countries, and we see political and popular powers and governments that take explicit stances toward al-Sa'ud and its interference in the region.\""\n\nHe reiterated Tehran's long-term grievances against Riyadh. \""Saudi Arabia started its hostility toward Iran after the victory of the Islamic Revolution [in 1979] and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, which supported the issues of Arab and Islamic countries.\"" Hence, Saudi Arabia should not be surprised by Iran's determination to triumph in the Persian Gulf region to the detriment of Saudi interests.\n\nOn September 23, 2019, Kayhan published an interview with Sheikh Nabil Qaouq, the Deputy Chairman of the ENTITY's Executive Council. He noted that the Houthi \""operation against the Saudi oil facilities ushered in a new era in the region, which [is] not favorable to the US and its regional client states\"". Consequently, \""Saudi Arabia is in despair, because it has spent hundreds of billions of dollars to purchase weapons and gain US support, but all to no avail.\"" Meanwhile, \""the US Administration is now embarrassed and distraught\"".\n\nQaouq further noted that \""the occupying regime of Israel\"" is also \""alarmed by the severity and accuracy\"" of the Houthi strikes, and is now \""fearing similar strikes on Zionist targets\"". This Israeli dread, Qaouq explained, had an overarching adverse impact on the US posture in the region given Israel's importance.\n\n\""The US axis in the region is retreating now as it admits its defeats in Iraq, Yemen, Syria, the besieged Gaza Strip, and Lebanon, and also against Iran.\"" With the pro-Iran regional camp rising, the US and its proxies \""receive new defeats every day, while the Axis of Resistance continues to add to its achievements and victories\"". Qaouq focused on the plight of Saudi Arabia. \""Saudi Arabia now faces two prospects, either humiliation or defeat. ... If the Saudi regime stays longer in Yemen, it will be humiliated. And if it pulls its forces out of Yemen, there will be a heavy defeat for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi Army, and the Arab Kingdom's status in the region,\"" Qaouq said. Under such circumstances, he concluded, there was no alternative but to accept the new regional posture: that of the ascent of Iran and the Shi'ite allies.\n\nMeanwhile, Tehran started to introduce stronger and more explicit aspects of the evolving Iranian grand strategy.\n\nOn September 20, 2019, the authoritative Ayatollah Ahmad Alamolhoda, a protégé of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, discussed Iran's new regional posture in a Friday Sermon. He stressed the Iranian regional dominance because \""Iran is the resistance in the region\"". Iran was, he said, no longer limited to a \""geographical location\"" because all of Iran's proxies throughout the region were \""all Iran\"" now.\n\n\""Iran, today, is not only Iran and not limited to a geographical location. Iraq's Hashd al-Shaabi, Lebanon's ENTITY, Yemen's AnsarAllah, Syria's National Defense Forces, Palestine's Islamic Jihad and the Hamas are all Iran,\"" Alamolhoda stated. \""Do you even know where Iran is? Isn't [the] south of Lebanon Iran? Isn't ENTITY Iran? The drones sent by the Yemenis that caused such damage to Saudi Arabia: wasn't that Iran? You say that (these drones) came from the north and not from the south. South or north, what difference does it make? Iran is both to your south and to your north. Today there is an alert Muslim in every part of this region, (and any place) where a fighting movement exists is Iran and its Imam is Iran and its leader is Iran.\""\n\nAlso on September 20, Maj.-Gen. Yahya Rahim Safavi, the top military aide to Khamene'i, delivered a sermon in Tehran to a select group of senior officials and officers. He analyzed Iran's emerging regional and global posture. \""With the grace of God and thanks to the vigilance and patience of the great Iranian nation and the unforgettable sacrifices of 200,000 martyrs ... the Iranian nation has become an invincible regional power in West Asia,\"" Safavi said.\n\n\""The Islamic Republic has turned into a major and invincible power in West Asia and if the Americans are planning any plots in the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea or the Indian Ocean, Iran will not leave them unanswered. ... If the Americans think of any plots against Iran, the Islamic Republic's will respond from an area extending from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean,\"" he warned. \""Any anti-Iranian move will overturn the region.\""\n\nSafavi explained that one of the key factors facilitating the ascent of Iran was the ongoing global transformation along the principles pursued by the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Russia. Consequently, he stressed, \""[the] US' policies in West Asia and its hegemony are defeated as the world is moving towards multilateralism\"".\n\nThese emerging circumstances enabled Iran to expect conducive regional dynamics while seeking a favorable regional posture. \""Our policy is to create lasting peace and security in the region and (seek) the withdrawal of foreign forces, and we hope that our trans-regional enemies would know that Iran does not intend to invade (other countries) or expand its territory,\"" Safavi said. As for more remote nemeses like Israel, Safavi reminded them of the assertion by ENTITY Leader Nasrallah that \""any move against Tehran will throw the whole region in a great turmoi\"".\n\nOther senior officers elaborated on these themes over the next few days. On September 21, 2019, IRGC Commander Maj.-Gen. Hossein Salami addressed a select group in Tehran. He assured them that Iran was \""ready for any type of scenario\"" the US and its allies might contrive. Iran was preparing to fight the war on enemy territory. \""Our readiness for giving response to any aggression is definitely assured. Now, whoever wishes to turn its land into a battleground is free to start it. But we will never allow the war be dragged into our land,\"" Salami stated.\n\nHe stressed Iran's commitment to a decisive victory. \""We will stand till the end because the response to a limited strike will not be limited. We will pursue any aggressor. We are after punishment and we will continue until the full destruction of any aggressor. ... We are result-oriented and good at follow-up. We have proven it. We won't spare any secure place [for our enemies]. So be careful and don't make a strategic mistake,\"" he advised Iran's enemies.\n\nAlso on September 21, IRGC Deputy Commander Rear Adm. Ali Fadavi emphasized the new stature of Iran: \""Today defending the values of [the] Islamic Revolution does not know any geographical boundaries and many people want to sacrifice their lives in the path of truth.\"" The next day, September 22, Iranian Navy Commander Rear Adm. Hossein Khanzadi also warned Iran's enemies of the dire consequences of attacking Iran. \""In case of any miscalculation and aggression by the enemy, [the] Army's Navy, along with other armed forces of the country, will give the most crushing reaction in the shortest time possible,\"" he claimed. \""Today, the Islamic Republic of Iran's defense power is at its highest possible level and [the] forces of [the] Army and [the] IRGC are ready to defend [the] marine borders of the country.\""\n\nKhanzadi belittled the threat posed by the US and its allies. \""No one should worry at all about the theatrical and fake coalitions that they form under the pretext of regional security. This region's security is established by the Islamic Republic of Iran and the regional states' naval forces.\""\n\nAddressing the Iranian Parliament on September 24, 2019, Iranian Armed Forces Chief of Staff Maj.-Gen. Mohammad Bagheri articulated Iran's Persian Gulf strategy.\n\nHe differentiated between efforts to reconcile with the regional Arab states and the possibility of a major war with the US to the detriment of the US' local allies. Tehran saw no difference between economic sanctions and the use of force.\n\n\""Today, enemies, who are fearful of a war with Iran, have taken the path of economic terrorism,\"" Baqeri said. The only viable issues were the specter of escalation and the Iranian response. \""We have repeatedly told our enemies that we will stand strong against acts of aggression and the same response that was given to the intruding (US) drone, and intruding UK fleet and ship will be given to any other aggressor. [The] result of aggression against Iran will be destruction and captivity,\"" Bagheri asserted.\n\nBagheri contrasted the Iranian resolve to defeat any US and allied forces with what the Iranian clerical leadership claims was the absence of animosity toward any of Iran's neighbors.\n\nIran was convinced that \""Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which are leading conspiracies against [Iran] in the region, are Islamic countries and have lost their path. They should return to the path of Islam and come closer to Iran. That is when we will have a secure and prospering region.\""\n\nThis would surely happen once the Arabs states pulled away from the US influence and became true to their Islamic selves. Bagheri offered military cooperation to the Arab and Muslim worlds as part of mutual security arrangements and agreements. \""(Now that) we have an independent defense industry in Iran today, these (military advances) belong to the Muslim world and everyone should know that regional security is provided by the cooperation of regional countries,\"" Bagheri stated. Tehran was eager to bring the Persian Gulf crisis to an amicable solution, which must include the banishment of the US and its Western allies, so that Tehran could focus better on the implementation of Iran's regional surge.\n\nFor Tehran, the Persian Gulf is but a component in Iran's true regional strategy and aspirations as articulated by Khamene'i on September 11, 2019. On September 22, 2019, the powerful Speaker of the Parliament, Ali Larijani, put everything in context, combining the Persian Gulf strategy with the surge to the Mediterranean strategy. Larijani stated that the formation by the US of \""a coalition to create so-called security in the Strait of Hormuz\"" was \""a new means for plundering the region\"".\n\nIran would not permit this to continue. \""The security of the Strait of Hormuz finds meaning with the security of other international waterways. Iran won't let the Persian Gulf become a playground for adventurism. Iran believes that this measure [the US-led coalition] is the start of an operation to destroy regional security,\"" Larijani said. Tehran was urging the Arab states across the Persian Gulf to adopt a mutual security regime which would replace the US. \""The regional countries, themselves, are capable of establishing security and the Islamic Iran's Armed Forces do not allow the Persian Gulf to be played with [as a tool] to create insecurity in the region.\""\n\nHowever, Larijani emphasized that the primary source of threats to Iran and its allies was not the US operations in the Persian Gulf but rather the US-Israeli cooperation in Syria and Iraq. The US objective was \""to prepare [the] domination of the occupying regime in Tel Aviv over regional states\"". A major instrument in this conspiracy were the US-sponsored jihadist forces in Syria and Iraq which operated against Iran and its local proxies.\n\n\""America is now helping terrorists and this is not a secret to us. But they should know that Iranian forces gave a heavy blow to terrorists in the region. Terrorists endangered the lives of Muslims. But the West should know that terrorist groups like ISIL will one day fly at them.\""\n\nUltimately, however, Iran considered Israel to be the main threat to Iran's regional interests. \""Tel Aviv is acting as the main enemy of the countries of the Middle East,\"" Larijani said. \""The Islamic Republic of Iran is a friend and brother of all regional countries while the Zionist regime is a major enemy of Muslims.\"" This determined Iran's security priorities. \""We know that our main duty today is to defend the oppressed Palestinian nation\"": that is, to fight Israel.\n\nLarijani concluded by highlighting Iran's achievements to-date.\n\n\""Our armed forces are stronger than ever. Security of Islamic Iran and the region is provided by our forces which are great assets for the region. When Iraq and Syria had been plagued by terrorism, it was our armed forces which defeated them. Despite the authority and power that the Iranian military has, Iran has never invaded a country in the past 40 years.\"" Larijani repeated Tehran's urging for the entire Arab World to build new relations of friendship, cooperation, and confidence with Iran.\n\n\""We emphasize that Islamic and Arab countries are our brothers and we wish to have good ties, in areas of culture and economy, with our neighbors.\"" The mutual challenge was in evicting all \""foreign entities\"" from the region, starting with the US and Israel. \""It is necessary to use [all] our energy power to counter outsiders and Zionists,\"" Larijani asserted.\n\nThe possibility that Israel would support the US operations in the Persian Gulf raised the urgency of confronting Israel to a higher level. On September 21, 2019, the Commander of the Iranian Army Maj.-Gen. Sayyed Abdolrahim Mousavi stressed the point. \""The Persian Gulf is our home and we will not allow a regime like the Israeli regime to enter our home.\"" He warned that \""any wrong move by Tel Aviv will even shorten its life.\"" Ayatollah Ahmad Alamolhoda warned that any attempt to \""trespass [Iran's] border\"" would lead to \""Israel becoming dust in half a day.\""\n\nHowever, as repeatedly stressed by Khamene'i, the top Iranian priority was to sustaining and strengthening the \""Axis of the Resistance\"" and particularly the on-land access to the Mediterranean it provided. The struggle over this access, rather than the Persian Gulf, was the most explosive clash point.\n\nIranian and Shi'ite officials have reiterated that Israel was the primary concern in this context. This was because it was Israel which was actually challenging the consolidation of the on-land access to the Mediterranean through repeated bombings and raids. And, as reiterated by Safavi, Nasrallah, and many other leaders, any move against Tehran and/or its vital interests \""will throw the whole region into a great turmoil\"".\n\nWith tensions rising quickly, the Hashd al-Shaabi immediately started to implement the concrete resolutions reached during the secret visit to Baghdad of Qods Force Commander Maj.-Gen. Qassem Soleimani on September 16, 2019. Two days later, on September 18, Hashd al-Shaabilaunched Operation The Will of Victory under the command of Col. Qassem Masliyah of the Qods Force.\n\nThe objective of the operation was to have sizeable units of Hashd al-Shaabi seize Iraq's borders with Saudi Arabia and Jordan, on top of the Iraqi border with Syria which it already controlled. In key points along both borders, Hashd al-Shaabi was to build staging facilities for surges by Shi'ite forces against Riyadh from the north and Jerusalem from the east. The actual seizure of the entire border with Saudi Arabia and Jordan was completed on September 21, 2019. Hashd al-Shaabi deployed several thousand mechanized troops with artillery and support units. The local Iraqi units withdrew peacefully.\n\nMeanwhile, the IRGC [Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps] started to transfer dozens of ballistic missiles to Hashd al-Shaabi. Initially, these missiles would be deployed in Diyala province. To reduce their vulnerability to Israeli strikes, the missiles were dispersed among numerous bases and concealed sites. These missiles were intended to both replace the losses caused by the recent Israeli bombings and to increase the arsenals in accordance with the contingency plans for the forthcoming surge and escalation by the Axis of the Resistance.\n\nThe Iranians also started delivering supplies for the newly announced air force of Hashd al-Shaabi. The first weapons delivered were \""anti-drone weapons\"" and a wide variety of anti-aircraft guns.\n\nOfficial Baghdad was not oblivious to both Operation The Will of Victory and the massive resupply effort.\n\nHence, on September 22, 2019, Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi announced a new \""restructuring initiative\"" for Hashd al-Shaabi which would expedite and smooth their \""ongoing integration into the Iraqi Army\"". Abdul-Mahdi appointed Falah al-Fayyad of Hashd al-Shaabi to be in charge of implementing these steps. Baghdad's rhetoric notwithstanding, the real objective of the new initiative was to provide fig-leaf legitimization for the surge of Hashd al-Shaabi, the dramatic changes along Iraq's borders, and the Iran-controlled war preparations.\n\nPolitically, Tehran continued focusing on stocking anti-US sentiments in order to compel the US out of the greater Middle East.\n\nThe September 14, 2019, Houthi strike on the Saudi oil installations was a major contribution to this effort.\n\nHowever, the focus remained on the surge of Iran and its Axis of Resistance to the Mediterranean, and the struggle with Israel to make this happen. The two foci of Iranian operations are intertwined, however.\n\nIran seems convinced that once the US withdrew from the greater Middle East then Israel would no longer enjoy a free hand to strike with impunity against Iranian and Iran-proxy targets throughout the region. Until then, Iran would keep consolidating the Shi'ite Crescent and escalating the push westward despite Israel's strikes. At the same time, Iran simultaneously intensifying the challenges to the US where it hurt: striking the US' Persian Gulf protectorates and their hydrocarbon infrastructure.\n\nIf this dual track approach failed to deliver the anticipated results quickly, Tehran would escalate further, ordering Iran's proxies to strike US forces and vital interests throughout the greater Middle East.\n\nIran has indicated that it was adamant on winning, and that it was ready to pay whatever price it would take. And presently, Iran's strategy is succeeding."

Alibaba Group,0,"NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Monday that his organization backs embattled Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey's right to speak his mind on the Hong Kong protest issue, without endorsing what he said.\n\nSpeaking to Kyodo News in Tokyo ahead of a preseason game between the Rockets and Toronto Raptors in Saitama on Tuesday, Silver acknowledged the damage Morey's tweet in support of the Hong Kong protest movement had caused the NBA's brand in China.\n\n(Adam Silver)\n\n\There is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear,\"" he said. \""There have already been fairly dramatic consequences from that tweet, and I have read some of the media suggesting that we are not supporting Daryl Morey, but in fact we have.\""\n\n\""I think as a values-based organization that I want to make it clear...that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression.\""\n\nWhile in Tokyo with the Rockets, Morey posted in a now-deleted tweet an image with the words \""Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong,\"" sparking a wave of online criticism -- much of it from China, a market in which the Texas-based team has long been extremely popular for featuring the now-retired Chinese hall of famer Yao Ming.\n\nSince early in the year, Hong Kong has seen a string of massive demonstrations sparked by concerns about a proposed extradition law that would allow the transfer of suspects accused of a crime to jurisdictions with which the city lacks an extradition deal, including mainland China.\n\nThe protesters have since broadened their issues of concern and turned the demonstrations into a wider pro-democracy movement.\n\nAs the Morey furor continued to rumble through NBA circles and elsewhere, ENTITY co-founder and owner of the Brooklyn Nets Joe Tsai released a statement which Silver called \""a fairly lengthy explanation from his standpoint on why (Morey's) words are so hurtful to Chinese fans.\""\n\n\""As a governor of one of the 30 NBA teams, and a Chinese having spent a good part of my professional life in China, I need to speak up,\"" wrote Tsai, who took control of the Nets in August.\n\n(Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey and Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta speak during Game Four of the Western Conference Semifinals of the 2019 NBA Playoffs on May 6, 2019 at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas.)[NBAE/Getty/Kyodo]\n\n\""There are certain topics that are third-rail issues in certain countries, societies and communities...Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all citizens in China.\""\n\nResponding to criticism that the NBA put its economic interests ahead of defending Morey and his right to express his views, Silver was clear.\n\n\""What I am supporting is his freedom of political expression in this situation,\"" he said.\n\n\""I am also supporting Joe Tsai. I realize, as I said again, these are complex issues they don't lend themselves easily to social media.

And I will just add that the fact that we have apologized to fans in China is not inconsistent with supporting someone's right to have a point of view.\""\n\nThe Rockets quickly distanced themselves from Morey's tweet, with the team's owner Tilman Fertitta tweeting \""@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization.\""\n\nMorey retreated from his earlier post, tweeting an explanation while reiterating the words were his own, not the Rockets' or the NBA's.\n\n\""I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China.

China,0,"BEIJING -- Among the 100,000 almost entirely domestic participants in ENTITY's military-led parade on Tuesday was a float bearing a dozen hand-picked foreigners -- a token tribute to overseas links at time when many of ENTITY's foreign ties are strained.\n\nThe 12 foreigners, including two Americans and citizens from African and European countries, joined the parade that featured some of ENTITY's most advanced military technology, including dozens of jets, intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of hitting the United States, and 15,000 soldiers.\n\n\They picked 12 people in the whole world and I happen to be one of them. It's quite an honor,\"" said Beijing-based American businessman Gary Dvorchak, whose family ties with President Xi Jinping date to Xi's often-mythologised visit to the U.S. state of Iowa in 1985.\n\nXi, at the time a member of a small provincial delegation on an agricultural tour, stayed with Dvorchak's family.\n\n\""My government contacts called in June and asked if I want to be in an event on national day ... I didn't know until two weeks ago that it was the parade,\"" Dvorchak told Reuters a day before the celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of ENTITY.\n\n\""They couldn't tell me what it was, but they said it'll be the honor of a lifetime, so I said 'OK'.\""\n\nThe nationally broadcast parade is a show of power by Xi, who has spearheaded a campaign for military modernization.\n\nIt is also a largely domestic affair, without any visiting heads of state.\n\nStill, ENTITY is at pains to present a friendly face to a world that is wary of its economic and military rise in the midst of a bitter dispute with the United States over trade and technology.\n\nPositive perceptions of ENTITY in Western countries have been eroded in the past year, according to a report released this week by the U.S.-based Pew Research Centre, as trade, diplomatic and human rights rows take a toll on its image.\n\nENTITY's displays of overseas friendship, often enlisting foreigners, are sometimes awkward. Ahead of the anniversary, state media issued several videos featuring foreigners, including a chorus of U.S., Italian and Canadian singers performing patriotic Chinese ballads.\n\nDRY RUN IN THE DARK\n\nDvorchak said some of the other foreigners taking part in the parade were flown to ENTITY. None of them was available for comment.\n\nHe said he and his foreign colleagues joined thousands of military and civilian participants in a dry run in the dead of night a week ago, including an hour-long ride by the foreigners on their float past Tiananmen Square.\n\n\""They did the whole thing, they had the TV screens up, they had cameras, even the galleries were filled with a practice audience,\"" he said.\n\n\""The people coming in from outside were awestruck.\""\n\nENTITY has invited larger numbers of foreigners to take part in the parade before.\n\nA decade ago, state media said 155 foreigners were involved, including dozens on a \""One World\"" float and 58 foreign experts and representatives of overseas companies.\n\nAt the time, ENTITY said the foreign participants were a sign of its \""increased openness to the outside world.\""\n\nThis time, the government has made only passing mention of the foreign participation in the parade.\n\n\""It's not like they're singling the U.S. out for friendship, in fact they're probably not,\"" said Dvorchak.\n\n\""It's very much about ENTITY and ENTITY celebrating itself, as it should be. It's just nice to be in it."
China,0,"For the fourth time in American history, impeachment proceedings have been launched against a sitting president. In 1868, 11 articles of impeachment were levied against Andrew Johnson for violating the Tenure of Office Act by firing Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Johnson had vetoed that law; it was overridden; and later declared unconstitutional. Johnson was acquitted in the Senate by a single vote.\n\nRichard Nixon was destroyed by Watergate. While the House did not formally impeach, Nixon knew he would be convicted by the Senate and resigned in August 1974. Nixon was the first and only president to do so. His replacement Gerald Ford was not re-elected in 1976.\n\nBill Clinton was charged with lying under oath and obstructing justice in 1999 over an affair with a White House intern. The vote to acquit was not even close. And Clinton's popularity soared.\n\nEnter Donald Trump. The trajectory of American politics has been tumbling in the wrong direction where polarization and division are endemic. Trump is loved or hated. The in-between region is largely unpopulated. The now infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is the cause celebre for Democrats who believe it is a smoking howitzer proving Trump abused power by threatening to withhold military aid in order to solicit foreign assistance in uncovering damaging information on former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nRELATED Trump asked Australian PM to investigate origins of Mueller's Russia probe\n\nRepublicans, so far, strongly disagree, leaping on the absence of a specific \quid pro quo\"" and arguing that the president was referring to information on interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The House Intelligence Committee, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has been assigned the lead in beginning this impeachment inquiry. Later this week, a number of witnesses will testify and at some stage so will the \""whistle-blower.\""\n\nWhat can possibly go wrong? Along with every major newspaper in the country that has chastised the Trump presidency for its failings on one issue or another, I have been highly critical. The foreign policy decisions to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord; the Transpacific Partnership; the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action; to start a tariff war with ENTITY; and the general disregard of allies in favor of autocrats have been disastrous for this nation and for global security. America is far less safe and secure than it was three years ago.\n\nUnfortunately, incompetence or blunders do not constitute \""high crimes and misdemeanors.\"" If they did, George W. Bush surely would have been dismissed over Iraq and Lyndon Johnson charged over Vietnam. Instead, Bush was re-elected and Johnson declined to run.\n\nRELATED House subpoenas Rudy Giuliani for Ukraine documents in impeachment probe\n\nSchiff is hyper-partisan. Rest assured, his investigation will likely uncover evidence of presidential wrongdoing. It may well be that Trump's Watergate could prove to be his civilian attorney Rudy Giuliani, whose interference in Ukraine on behalf of his client may have broken the law much as former Trump campaign adviser Paul Manafort did in different circumstances. Or the \""whistle-blower's\"" well-referenced complaint may be the grounds for abuse or obstruction. The question is whether any of these charges rise to the level of \""treason, bribery or high crimes and misdemeanors.\""\n\nRegardless of Schiff's findings and assuming the House votes to impeach, which it may not, will the Senate convict? The record is 0 for 2. Or will the charges be so compelling that Trump, like Nixon, is forced to resign? Those who know the president think not.\n\nThe House, meaning Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., may decide that rather than impeachment, censuring will have greater impact in the 2020 election to discredit the president. But as with the Mueller report that brought no charges, Trump will declare a victory if the House fails to impeach.\n\nRELATED Rep. Adam Schiff: Trump whistle-blower agrees to testify in Congress\n\nSuppose, however, that the inquiry proves beyond any reasonable doubt presidential wrongdoing and misconduct and that for some reason, no matter how unlikely, the Senate convicts. Trump is removed from office and Mike Pence replaces him. Would that prevent Trump from running again in 2020? Who knows?\n\nA nation divided against itself cannot stand. One hundred and sixty years ago, Abraham Lincoln correctly predicted civil war. Fortunately, America is not as divided today as it was in 1861. But the partisanship and outright hatred displayed by both parties toward the other, intensified by a president who believes he can determine and interpret the law to fit his needs, suggest that as with Brexit in the United Kingdom, no good outcome from the inquiry is possible.\n\nTough cases reportedly make for bad law. How these impeachment hearings evolve is unpredictable, possibly in the extreme. But if anything can go wrong, bet on that happening.\n\nHarlan Ullman is UPI's Arnaud de Borchgrave Distinguished Columnist and a senior adviser at the Atlantic Council.

China,0,"(Adds details on US special representative visit to Pakistan)\n\nKABUL/ISLAMABAD, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Afghan Taliban officials were due in Pakistan on Wednesday, the insurgent group said, as the top U.S. diplomat involved in talks with the militants also met government officials there, although it was not known if the Taliban and U.S. official would meet.\n\nThe Taliban delegation led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, one of the group's founders, was due to discuss \""important issues\"" with Pakistani officials in the capital, Islamabad, Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said on Twitter.\n\nThe Taliban visit, the latest stop on a tour of regional powers, comes after efforts by the militants and the United States to reach a deal allowing for the withdrawal of U.S.-led foreign forces broke down last month.\n\nThe top U.S. negotiator in the talks, Special Representative for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad, met Pakistani counterparts in Islamabad this week, following discussions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan in the United States the previous week.\n\n\""These consultations follow discussions held between the United States and Pakistan during the United Nations General Assembly in New York last week,\"" said a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad via email.\n\nThe spokesman did not say if Khalilzad was still in Pakistan on Wednesday or if he planned to meet the Taliban officials.\n\nThe United States has long considered Pakistani cooperation as crucial to efforts to end war in Afghanistan.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump last month halted the talks with the Taliban aimed at striking a deal allowing U.S. and other foreign troops to withdraw in exchange for Taliban security guarantees, following the death of a U.S. solder and 11 others in a Taliban bomb attack in Kabul.\n\nThe Taliban delegation would inform Pakistan's leadership of the factors that derailed the talks, said a Taliban official, who declined to be identified.\n\nThe U.S. and Taliban said last month, shortly before talks broke off, that they were close to reaching a deal, despite concern among some U.S. security officials and within the Afghan government that a U.S. withdrawal could plunge the country into even more conflict and open the way for a resurgence of Islamist militant factions.\n\nThe Taliban also planned to follow up on Khan's recent comments, that he would try to convince Trump to resume the talks, the Taliban official said.\n\nA government source in Pakistan who declined to be identified told Reuters the Taliban would arrive on Wednesday evening and meet Khan.\n\nSediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said on Twitter that the Afghan government should be involved in any peace process.\n\n\""No progress will be imminent if a peace process is not owned and led by the Afghan government,\"" he said.\n\nThe Taliban have refused to negotiate with the Afghan government, dismissing it as a U.S. puppet.\n\nTaliban officials have in recent days visited Russia, ENTITY and Iran.\n\nPakistan supported the Taliban from the group's founding in the midst of Afghanistan's civil war in the early 1990s.\n\nThe United States and the U.S.-backed Afghan government have for years suspected Pakistan has maintained its support for the militants, as a tool to block the spread of Indian influence in Afghanistan, despite Pakistani denials.\n\n(Reporting by Jibran Ahmed in Peshawar, Pakistan and Abdul Qadir Sediqi and Orooj Hakimi in Kabul and Charlotte Greenfield and Asif Shahzad in Islamabad Writing by Rod Nickel in Kabul and Charlotte Greenfield in Islamabad Editing by Robert Birsel)"
China,0,"The US economy's growth rate is losing speed, prompting questions over how slow it can go and still avoid crashing into a recession.\n\nWhereas expansion below two percent used to almost guarantee the economy would subsequently contract, some economists now reckon the US can wobble around one percent-1.5 percent without falling over, Bloomberg wrote.\n\nThe decline in the economy's so-called stall speed is a relief after data signaled the weakest manufacturing sector in a decade. It still leaves the Federal Reserve under pressure to cut interest rates and President Donald Trump facing challenges heading into next year's election.\n\nWhether the longest expansion in history remains intact may ultimately depend on whether consumers are able to maintain spending enough to offset the slump in manufacturing amid the US-ENTITY trade war.\n\n\Suddenly the idea of stall speed is much more important today than it has been for most of the expansion,\"" said Stephen Gallagher, chief US economist at Societe Generale SA. \""The economy is running on one engine, and that's the consumer.\""\n\nAt Commerzbank AG, currency strategist Ulrich Leuchtmann told clients in a report on Wednesday that \""the fact that stall speed is becoming an issue of common interest\"" may undermine demand for US assets.\n\nTaking a page from aviation, in which the stall speed is the slowest a plane can fly while still maintaining a level flight, the economic equivalent is the point at which growth is no longer self-sustaining.\n\nThat happens when consumers and companies pull back in the face of the lackluster economic performance.\n\n\""When economic actors become sufficiently concerned whether justified or not -- a mild slowdown can easily become worse,\"" Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management Inc., wrote in a report last month.\n\nThe outlook for growth has indeed softened, with the manufacturing sector already slipping into a recession during the first half of the year, capital investment weakening and job gains moderating. Analysts expect growth in gross domestic product to slow to 1.7 percent next year.\n\nIn expansions dating back to the 1940s, real GDP growth below two percent was almost always followed by a recession, according to Lascelles. Now, he and other economists expect the economy can avoid buckling at that pace.\n\nA reduced stall speed means growth can be slower and monthly payroll gains can be softer and still sustain the expansion.\n\nThe stall speed has largely declined because the potential growth rate of the economy has slowed.\n\nThe two concepts are closely tied. Potential growth is the pace at which the economy can expand without inflation heating up. Right now, the Fed sees potential growth at 1.9 percent. Predictions by the Congressional Budget Office for the rate have also come down over time. It's eased amid demographic changes like slower population growth and softer productivity gains.\n\n\""The problem here is if potential growth is slowing, what constitutes a rapid expansion today is very different than what it looked like maybe 40 years ago,\"" said Michael Gapen, chief US economist at Barclays Plc.\n\nAnd the expansion has been lackluster. Since the end of the recession in 2009, GDP has increased about half as much on a percentage basis as it did during the 1991-2001 expansion, the nation's second-longest. Wage growth has remained subdued and inflation has repeatedly missed the Fed's two percent target.\n\n\""We expect stall speed for the economy to be in the vicinity of 1.4-1.5 percent real GDP growth (in year-on-year terms). Below that, household income creation slows to such a pace that consumers are unable to shoulder the growth burden.\""\n\nMost economists predict the economy can stay above their self-defined stall speed level next year, but Joachim Fels and Andrew Balls of Pacific Investment Management Co. expect growth to slow to about 1 percent in the first half of 2020.\n\n\""While a recession is not our base case, it doesn't take much to tip over an economy that is moving along at stall speed,\"" Fels and Balls wrote in the report last week.\n\nWhile a slower stall speed means the economy can expand at a more subdued pace without signaling imminent recession, the bad news is that it doesn't mean the US is less exposed to a downturn.\n\nLower potential growth \""tells you that a shock that we may have experienced before the crisis which may not have tipped you into recession could certainly do so now,\"" said Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank AG.\n\nAs economic growth withers, fiscal and monetary stimulus, provided that they are employed in a timely fashion, can give the economy much-needed lift. But policy makers at the Fed and in Congress have less room to keep the nation from hitting stall speed -- or possibly accelerating out of it.\n\n\""It raises the risk of the end of the economic cycle,\"" Gapen said. \""We've done what we can do on the fiscal side. There's limited space for monetary policy to react."
China,0,"Global economic growth is expected to hit an eight-year low of 2.5 percent next year, according to ratings agency Fitch, abc.net.au wrote.\n\n\The outlook for the global economy has deteriorated significantly due to the escalation in the US-ENTITY trade war,\"" the agency wrote in its Global Economic Outlook, released on Wednesday.\n\nIn the past 15 months, the world's two biggest economies have levied hundreds of billions of dollars in tit-for-tat tariffs on each other's imports, which is having a major impact on factory activity in several countries.\n\nThe United States has recorded its worst manufacturing result in 10 years, while the eurozone economies have contracted to a seven-year low.\n\nWith lingering trade tensions weighing on manufacturing and exports, the US and EU data mirrored similar downbeat patterns in the eurozone, Japan, the United Kingdom and ENTITY.\n\n\""World growth has not been as low as 2.5 percent since 2012, a year that saw the eurozone sovereign debt crisis in full swing and a marked slowdown in ENTITY,\"" wrote Brian Coulton, Fitch's chief economist and the report's lead author.\n\nThe Australian economy has been growing for 28 consecutive years, but there are troubling signs, and the future is difficult to see, wrote Josh Gordon.\n\nIn comparison, Fitch is expecting world GDP growth to be 2.6 percent this year -- which is a significant drop from last year's 3.2 percent.\n\nSimilar views were echoed by Rabobank's head of global economics Jan Lambregts, who is predicting a \""modest\"" global recession to happen in 2020-2021, \""using the 'old' IMF definition of global GDP growth coming in below three percent\"".\n\n\""At the heart of the slowdown is a downturn in global manufacturing that's already visible in Asia, spilling over into Europe and eventually set to hit the United States,\"" he said.\n\n\""A full decade after the global financial crisis, it's tempting to think we are both better able to avert any financial crisis and better prepared to deal with one should it still happen.\n\n\""But whether that's truly the case remains to be seen.\""\n\nLast month, Australia's economy slowed to its most sluggish pace in a decade with annualized GDP growth of 1.4 percent, well below the Reserve Bank's forecasts.\n\nThe RBA, meanwhile, cut Australia's official cash rate to a record low 0.75 percent on Tuesday in an attempt to stimulate the flagging economy.\n\nThe Conversation's 2019-20 forecasting panel is predicting an economic growth rate as weak as any since the GFC.\n\nFitch, however, expects the domestic economy to pick up slightly and expand by a \""lackluster\"" 1.7 percent by the end of 2019.\n\n\""However, a downgrade to our ENTITY growth forecast and a more challenging outlook for commodity prices have prompted a modest cut to our 2020 and 2021 growth forecasts,\"" Fitch said.\n\nThe ratings agency expects a further pickup in Australian GDP growth next year (+2.3pc) and in 2021 (+2.4pc). But those predictions are still a modest downgrade (-0.1pc) compared to its previous estimates."
China,0,"Marine Corps Pfc. Grady J. Crawford returned home Friday, nearly 70 years after his mother received a telegram saying he'd gone missing on a frozen battlefield in the Korean War, thousands of miles from where he'd grown up in Dallas.\n\nHis arrival begins a long-delayed homecoming celebration for Grady's family and a day of reflection for a lost son of the city who died in a bleak and distant war.\n\nAt 2:17 p.m., Friday, a flag-draped casket carrying the remains of the Marine killed in the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir, one of the most historic in Corps history, arrived at DFW Airport on a Delta Air Lines plane traveling from Los Angeles. The casket was flown overnight from Honolulu to Los Angeles.\n\nGrady's surviving relatives, including his sister-in-law and four nieces, met the flight Friday afternoon on the tarmac. As they stood nearby, an honor guard of seven Marines in dress uniforms received Grady's casket and escorted it to a hearse.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon the family will honor Grady, a Woodrow Wilson High School graduate, with a service and burial open to the public at Restland Funeral Home.\n\nAmong those at DFW Airport Friday was Crawford's niece, Colleen O'Quinn Crawford. Her late father, Bill, was Grady's younger brother and a fellow Korean War veteran.\n\n\It's just -- it's beautiful,\"" Colleen said in a halting voice. \""It's like Halley's Comet. You never think that's going to happen in your lifetime. But it's happened. It's very profound,\"" she said.\n\nBorn December 16, 1928, Grady Crawford was the oldest of two boys.\n\nThe Crawfords lived in the Lakewood neighborhood of Dallas. Grady lettered in football and was active in boxing and swimming. But his passion was Junior ROTC, where he achieved sharpshooter and marksman medals, according to the 1947 high school yearbook.\n\n\""We heard growing up what a little warrior he was,\"" Colleen said.\n\nAfter graduating in 1947, he enlisted in the Marines. A few years later, his brother, Bill, joined the Merchant Marines and was also a Korean War veteran.\n\nThe year before Grady arrived in Korea, tragedy struck the family back home. Grady's father, Walter Grady Crawford, died Nov. 5, 1949, from injuries sustained after a city bus struck him near the intersection of Gaston Avenue and Dumas Street in Old East Dallas.\n\nThe elder Crawford, who was 54, stumbled after getting off the bus and fell under its rear wheels as the bus pulled away from the curb, according to a front-page article in The News.\n\n\""It was crazy,\"" said Colleen. \""They lost their father in a freak accident.\""\n\nThe conflict in Korea, which began in June of 1950, was overshadowed by World War II, which preceded it, and the Vietnam War, which came after.\n\nThe late author David Halberstam called it a war \""orphaned by history.\""\n\n\""It has been referred to as the 'forgotten war,' but not by those who fought the war. They don't forget,\"" said Hal Barker, a Korean War historian from Dallas who operates the Korean War Project website with his brother Ted, also from Dallas.\n\nGrady fought in the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir, one of the most historic of the Korean War. The battle is one that has come to define the legacy of the Marine Corps, the details of which are shared with every Marine recruit going through boot camp.\n\nThe brutal, 17-day battle took place in sub-zero temperatures and involved a U.S. force of 12,000 Marines and about 3,000 soldiers surrounded by the enemy.\n\nThe 1st Marine Division had taken up positions in the craggy and rugged region of North Korea on the west side of the Chosin reservoir with the Army set up on the east side. The plan was to drive the North Korean Army north toward ENTITY.\n\nBut on Nov. 27, an overwhelming force of 120,000 Chinese troops, allied with the North Koreans, launched a surprise attack on the Americans. The intense battles mostly took place at night with the Chinese soldiers attacking in waves, according to accounts by the military and historians.\n\nThe soldiers on the east side of the reservoir were nearly wiped out in a slaughter. On the west side of the reservoir, the 1st Marine Division was looking at the same fate.\n\nFaced with annihilation or a mass surrender, the Marines chose neither, deciding instead to fight their way through the Chinese troops and escape to the south.\n\nThe conditions couldn't have been worse. Temperatures had plunged to 25 degrees below zero, causing rampant frostbite. The bitter cold caused weapons to jam. The Marines ran short of ammunition and food.\n\nAssembled around the town of Yudam-ni, the Marines had only one way out, a one-lane road leading south to Hagaru-ri. \""December 1st, the Marines started their breakout from Yudam-ni,\"" said Barker, the Dallas-based Korean War historian.\n\nChinese forces attacked the Marines in the hills surrounding Yudam-ni. The Marines fought their way south through the Toktong Pass, finally reaching safety after three days. But the Marines had suffered 1,500 casualties.\n\nGrady Crawford was among them.\n\nOnly 21 at the time, Grady was part of the 4th Battalion, 11th Marine Regiment of the 1st Marine Division. Assigned to an artillery unit, his mission on Dec. 1 was to provide cover as other Marines evacuated. Grady was last seen that day in the town of Yudam-ni, and the Marines officially listed him as missing.\n\nGrady's brother, Bill, who served in the Merchant Marines during the war, often told his daughters that Grady's best friend in the Marines told him he last saw Grady running over a hill, and \""when he looked again, Grady was gone,\"" Colleen said.\n\nA Marine liaison to the Crawford family described the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir as \""a victorious retreat,\"" Colleen said.\n\nGrady's gung-ho patriotism was \""very typical,\"" of those who enlisted in the Marines in those days, Barker said. \""We've had several of our friends from Woodrow Wilson High School who joined the Marines.\""\n\nAnother Korean War Marine veteran grew up three or four blocks from Grady, Barker said. \""They were drawn to the military and the Marine Corps was the unit if you really wanted to fight.\""\n\nOther than a telegram notifying them that Grady was missing, the Crawfords knew virtually nothing about what happened to him. \""The family members of the missing don't know anything, which is 100 percent typical,\"" Barker said.\n\nAs it turned out, Grady's remains were among those returned to U.S. custody about a year after the 1953 ceasefire. In September of 1954, as part of an exchange of war dead called Operation Glory, the North Korean government returned to United States custody over 4,000 sets of remains recovered from an isolated burial site on the west side of the Chosin Reservoir, Barker said.\n\n\""It was heartbreaking,\"" Colleen Crawford said. \""He's been here the whole time in Hawaii and we didn't know.\""\n\nThe technology for identifying remains is advancing every year, but it's still a long, arduous process, she said. \""The process is starting to speed up, so there's hope for others that it won't take as long.\""\n\nMany of the returned remains could not be identified at the time and were buried as unknowns at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, located at the Punchbowl Crater in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\nIn 2012, some of these unknown remains were exhumed for reexamination. They included a set of remains identified only as X-14896. Those remains proved to be Grady's.\n\nAdvances in forensic techniques allowed scientists with the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) to identify Grady. His remains consisted of a nearly complete skeleton, which is considered highly unusual, the family was told. To identify Crawford's remains, DPAA scientists used dental, anthropological and skull analysis, as well as circumstantial and material evidence, according to a Pentagon news release.\n\nMore than 7,000 American service members remain missing from the Korean war, with most believed to have been last seen in North Korea, Barker said. Families would simply get a telegram informing them their son or brother was missing, Barker said.\n\n\""We've got hundreds of these stories, he said. \""The notification would come and the mother would drop dead or go into severe depression,\"" he said.\n\nThe Crawfords had no clue what was coming.\n\nOn July 15 of this year, the Marines tracked down the Crawfords to Peru, Indiana, where Colleen, who was born and raised in Dallas, and her mother, were now living.\n\nWhen Colleen answered the phone that Monday, a Marine liaison told her that her Uncle Grady had been identified. \""My mom was standing next to me. I had to pick my jaw off the ground,\"" Colleen said. \""And then I handed the phone to my mom.\""\n\nColleen's mom, Nancy Crawford Dice, who was Grady's sister-in-law, was equally flabbergasted. \""After 70 years, to get this call. It was so off-the-wall,\"" Nancy Crawford Dice said.\n\nAfter arriving in Dallas, Colleen tried to compose herself while explaining to a reporter the events since that call from the Marines.\n\n\""It's beautiful. We are overwhelmed with joy for a beautiful closure. There's so much to love about Grady -- his service and his passion to serve his country. He was a warrior.\""\n\nAt DFW Airport Friday, Colleen was joined by a small group that included her mother and her three sisters, all nieces of Grady's: Christi Crawford and Teri Moore, of Peru, Indiana, and Alicia Burrough, of Mountainburg, Arkansas.\n\nVisitation will take place Saturday from 2-4 p.m. at the Memorial Chapel at Restland Funeral Home at 13005 Greenville Ave., Dallas. Grady will be buried at 4 p.m. at the Restland cemetery near the grave of his younger brother, Bill.\n\nBarbara Adamson, co-founder of the Woodrow Wilson High School alumni association, said she invited the school to ask current Junior ROTC students to attend the funeral. Adamson said she's also planning to honor Grady at the school's 90th anniversary celebration October 26th.\n\nAt the airport, under warm and sunny skies, the Crawford sisters and their mom gathered at the back of the hearse after the Marines put Grady's casket inside. As they embraced, each one took a moment to press a hand on the casket.\n\n\""He's home,\"" Christi Crawford said, wiping tears from her eyes with a tissue. \""He's home"

Rohit Sharma,0,"With a tightened defence and improved temperament -- the latter more crucial -- ENTITY has become tough to dislodge once he has negotiated the initial phase at the crease.\n\nWith three hundreds in four innings, including a double hundred, the fears of ENTITY failing in his opener-avatar in Tests seem grossly misplaced. Far from it, the ploy seems to be a masterstroke, at least in the subcontinent.\n\nThe approach\n\nEven in the 50-over version, ENTITY these days sticks to a pattern: watchful start, steady acceleration, and the final flourish. To an extent, he adheres to the same philosophy in Test matches too. For instance, during his double hundred in Ranchi, he scored just 20 runs in the first 50 balls that he faced. With the new ball seaming around, he was wary to not play at deliveries that he did not need to.\n\nAnything even marginally on the fourth-fifth stump line, he left, unlike in the past where he had the tendency to \feel\"" the ball from the crease quite early in the innings. Not any longer. Anything into his body, he has been getting behind the line of the ball and defending.\n\nWith a tightened defence and improved temperament -- the latter more crucial -- ENTITY has become tough to dislodge once he has negotiated the initial phase at the crease. And unlike in the past, he no longer offers the fielding side too many chances either.\n\nAdvertising Streak of discipline\n\nQuite often in his past outings in Tests, ENTITY had the proclivity to play one stroke too many after he'd got a start. While it worked perfectly in ODIs, the instinct resulted in a lot of unfulfilled starts in Tests. But ENTITY has meticulously ironed out these flaws. It has not hindered his stroke-making, but he doesn't try to manufacture ambitious strokes -- and he no longer succumbs to a craving to demolish bowlers.\n\nRather, he waits for the loose ball, even marginally erring ones, and latches on to them. This feature of his game too, is an off-shoot of the modified approach in the 50-over game. Marginally full, he'll drive, trifle short, he'll pull. Outside the off-stump, he'll murder; into the body, he'll defend. As the commentator's cliche goes, the margin for error is minuscule.\n\nRuthless to spinners\n\nFew contemporary batsmen are as evolved or nuanced in the art of six-hitting as ENTITY, a feature of his game that even Virat Kohli envies. It's an aspect that has been missing among India's batsmen, more so against spinners. Nothing upsets the latter more than seeing batsmen step out and smear them over the ropes. It is undisputed that there are exceptional players of spin around, like Cheteshwar Pujara, but no one has quite demoralised spinners as ENTITY has done. In Vizag, he tore Dane Piedt and Keshav Maharaj apart, and they never quite recovered from the battering.\n\nMan of many strokes\n\nThe sheer range of ENTITY's strokeplay is so spectacular that it's difficult for bowlers to set a field or plan his dismissal. He has his favourite shots and areas of course, like the cover drive and cover region, or the pull and an arc between fine leg and mid-wicket, but he's also someone who has two shots, if not more, for the same ball."

Rohit Sharma,0,"I was going through the sports page of one of the mainstream Malayalam newspaper today. Was stunned and sad to see the kind of language used. Some of the points mentioned were \""Kohli played cautiously like Sachin to move from 90 to 100. And, reached 100 by executing a Sachin style straight drive. Kohli took out of form Ajinkya Rahane under his wings and outplayed South African bowlers\"". I cannot understand and even talked about it to few who understands cricket and they said, it is just ridiculous, and it is just story writing and not news reporting.\n\nThere is no doubt, Sachin Tendulkar is an idol, God of Cricket for Indians. But he was in a different league of his own and so is Virat Kohli. By saying that one plays cautiously in his 90s to reach the 100, you are ridiculing both Sachin and Virat and in a way admitting that they play for records. If you cannot read the game or understand what the team management decided to do on the match day-2, don't assume things. Anybody who understands cricket, the team batting in the 1 session of a day will obviously play cautiously and will save the wickets for if they lose a wicket early, there was every chance that India would get bundle out for less than 400 and it will be decisive in winning and drawing the match, even if not losing it. And, taking that as slowing down by Kohli to get another 100/milestone is a shame. If that was his attitude, Virat Kohli would not have declared the innings when he could have easily extended the innings for next half an hour (5-6 overs) to give a shot at his 1 triple hundred, he was in such murderous mood and almost all Indians would have loved to see another triple hundred from an Indian player. Nobody would have complained, unless for some people who wanted to create controversies and make it a debate running for days for business mileage. Since they are comparing everything with Sachin, why didn't they compare yesterday's declaration with the hue and cry made when Rahul Dravid declared the innings when Sachin was at 194 n.o against Pakistan in 2004 at Multan. Sachin was upset over it, but Kohli happily went for the declaration. This paper didn't even acknowledge or did a mention of it. They would have mentioned it if the Captain and the batsman were different, because the business thrives on negativity and controversies and who is bothered about the sportsman spirit or gentleman's game.\n\nNow, coming to the point of out-of-form Rahane's case. Where in the world would the recent scores of 81 & 102 (man of the match), 24 & 64 n.o., 15 & 27 n.o., 59 in the recent 4 test matches against West Indies & SA would make it out of form? totally absurd isn't it. Why such negativity or is the reporter unaware of what is going around in the game before reporting such non-senses. Over last 2-3 years, this combination of Kohli & Rahane has given the Indian team some of the solid partnerships needed for away wins, which is much more challenging than playing in Indian pitches. They know very well what to do and they did that again yesterday in the 1 session, which obviously helped them to go aggressive in the 2 & 3 sessions to rest the onus with the team.\n\nIt is a cardinal mistake to compare legends or greats playing at different times, whoever they are and comparing them illogically is disrespecting both the parties to it. Kohli's straight drive to complete his 26 hundred was not like Sachin's, why do you want to put it that way. Both play differently and both are treats to our eyes when in full flow, we do not want them to be compared. Let us leave Virat or anybody like ENTITY to play peacefully and not bothered about records. After the 1 test ENTITY, with back to back centuries in the 1 test against SA was compared to Sir Donald Bradman and even better than that. How can anybody do that just based on the scores. Milestones and records should never overtake the game. They should remain within each era. Because the game, the facilities and the surroundings have been going through lot of changes to make it a thriving business. So, you can never compare the players in different era and do not make the mistake to do so as well.\n\nMany media, be it print or visual or now the social media, assumed there is fight between Dhoni and Kohli when Dhoni was around. Now, since Dhoni is taking some time away from the game, the matter is shifted to another set of senior players in the team, Kohli & ENTITY. One did not clap, another one did not smile.... what nonsense? If at all there is some rift, is it right for the media to make it worse, write unnecessary stories and try to make the rift wide open and irreparable and affect the performance of the individuals and in-turn the team? Or, do something better like reminding them of the wonderful partnerships they combined to murder the opposition and stay united for the interest of the game and the supporters.\n\nGood criticism is always welcome and should be done. Why is the media not giving any importance to Hanuma Vihari being dropped from the team in the 2 test? He has been a solid player in the middle over for India in test matches for over a year now. His recent scores being (32 & 93, 111 & 53 n.o, 10) and still dropped from the team for the current test match.\n\nThis is just one of the many such bad comparisons that we see now a days. And sports news attracts many youngsters and these kinds of negativity will sometimes stick on to the young generation which in-turn will affect their thought process as well. After all, what value does records, and milestones have if the team does not win the match. We, the supporters idolize some of the great players, but we want to see Indian team winning the matches and the collective efforts to do so."
Rohit Sharma,0,"Sangwan's much-fancied opponent Naman Tanwar had to pull out of Thursday's title clash in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh due to shoulder trouble. Of course, Wednesday's semifinal compensated for the lack of hardships in the final.\n\nSumit Sangwan is the definition of bad luck.\n\nAt the 2012 Olympics, then 19-year-old Sangwan lost his opening round in what commentators called a \""daylight robbery\"".\n\nHe went to the 2014 Commonwealth Games with two rods holding his fractured left thumb together, and won a bout with a swollen hand before losing the quarterfinal.\n\nHe recovered to win the 81kg gold medal at 2015 senior nationals along with the best boxer trophy, but went under the surgeon's knife to treat the thumb, now fractured twice. Another comeback led him to the Olympics qualifier in 2016 where he lost in the quarterfinals, but could have booked his flight to Rio had his opponent marched on to win gold. \""He told me at the dinner table that he was going to withdraw. I rushed to my coach but there was no point because our federation was banned.\""\n\nAdvertising\n\nThen in late 2017, he had his right elbow operated upon for the loose bone chips he had been boxing with for two years. Such a run would make anyone feel like they're cursed. \""I met so many people in that time who would say jaadu-tona hua hai, kisi ne kuch kar diya hai. My mother took me to the village baba (people would say someone has done black magic),\"" says Sangwan, mustering a wry smile.\n\n\""I'm sitting with a baba in this jhopdi, aag jali hui hai (a fire had been lit). When you're sad, people who want your good will resort to anything.\""\n\nFor such a tormented soul, the gold medal at the senior nationals, his first in the 91kg category, came uncharacteristically easily. Sangwan's much-fancied opponent Naman Tanwar had to pull out of Thursday's title clash in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh due to shoulder trouble. Of course, Wednesday's semifinal compensated for the lack of hardships in the final.\n\nSangwan was floored twice in the opening minutes of Wednesday's semifinal by Gaurav Chauhan of Services. That after the two knockdowns, the man from Karnal, Haryana managed to eke out a 3-2 win shows his heart, and the technical know-how. \""I'd faced him twice before and won 5-0 both times,\"" said Sangwan. \""He comes out hard, but opens himself up. I knew that in the later rounds he will come down.\""\n\nOnce a top light-heavyweight, Sangwan moved up to the heavyweight division.\n\n\""In 81kg, I was the tallest and always boxed according to that advantage,\"" says the 6'3'' Sangwan. \""Now most people are of my height and some are taller. So the pattern of fighting, technique has changed.\""\n\nNow it is about the \""time the mind and body takes to adjust to heavyweight punches.\""\n\n\""Body jhel legi if it's just four or five kilos. But 10 kilos ka fark hai,\"" Sangwan adds. \""When you get punched by a heavyweight, your body goes all the way back. And that's just the punch hitting your guard, imagine what will happen if it hits on the face. That confidence doesn't come automatically. It takes time to understand how to take the risk.\"" Sangwan began 2016 with two losses to Naman Tanwar in the selection trials, the second for the Commonwealth Games. Earlier this year, he lost another trial bout for the Asian Championships to Tanwar.\n\n\""I was doing well in the camp before, but every evening my temperature would be high. We didn't do a blood check, and by the time we tested it was full blown typohid. I took glucose, and won a bout but against Tanwar I was dizzy and couldn't see anything properly,\"" Sangwan says, gauges the room and adds: \""I know it seems like an excuse but the coach knew. It's just luck.\""\n\nSangwan's sheepish laughs indicate the boxer knows how it sounds, but he assures the roller-coaster has been a hellish ride for the person on it.\n\n\""I have cried alone in a room. I have worked so hard but saw others go in my place. My parents have been supportive but seeing my plight at home they'd go 'haath tudva ke mat aya kar'. So I used to stay with a friend in Sonipat who helped me out with food, laundry,\"" says Sangwan. \""I know people who have written me off. But I can't stop. Boxing is my happiness. Wake up in the morning, go to the ground and find your weaknesses, run and listen to coach's abuse and come back. This is happiness. Kabhi khoon nikalta hai, kabhi haddi tootti hai but yahi maza hai. (Sometimes you bleed, some times there are broken bones but it is fun).\""\n\nSangwan's lowest point would however bring tears to the eyes of connoisseurs of fine clothing. \""My mummy called a priest and gave away my clothes. I have given a month's salary to these babas. I am buying these clothes from malls and she gives them baba. 4000 ki jeans pe jhadu-phook rahe hain,\"" he laughs. \""I told mummy 'Stop!

Rohit Sharma,0,"AGRA: After two years on the run, kingpins of the Rs 1,000 crore Ponzi internet scam that duped over a lakh investors were finally arrested by Agra police on Saturday.\n\nNotably, the police breakthrough came two years after an FIR was lodged in Sikandra police station against the director and associates of a Ghaziabad-based IT firm company. Identified as Varun Kumar, a resident of Ajnara Crossing Republik Ghaziabad, and his associate Amit Saxena, a resident of Omaxe Forest Spa, Noida, was picked up from Gurugram and Lucknow, respectively, from rented accommodations of their distant relatives. The duo originally hailed from Uttar Pradesh' Bijnor district.\n\nAccording to police, in order to dodge arrest, Saxena was regularly changing his location, while Gupta maintained a low profile. In 2016, Varun Kumar alias Varun Gupta along with Aman ENTITY - a resident of Bijnor's Dhampur - in consultation with Saxena floated an IT firm named Payway IT Solutions Private Limited which was based in Pacific Business Park, Kaushambi, Ghaziabad. Importantly, co-founder ENTITY and another accused, Saxena's wife Juhi, are still on the run.\n\nPolice sources claimed that around 1.5 lakh investors of UP, Haryana, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Punjab were duped in less than six months for an estimated Rs 1,000 crore.\n\nSSP, Agra, Babloo Kumar told TOI, \""The matter came to light in Agra, after a local resident identified as Yashpal lodged an FIR at Sikandra police station against the director and other associates of the IT firm. Yashpal had invested Rs 13.80 lakh that included money of his 14 family members. Soon, he realised that he was duped like other investors. Later, we found a few more FIRs were registered against the company at Link road police station of Ghaziabad and Cyber police station of Gurugram.\""\n\n\""After a long period of surveillance and probe, our team nabbed the two accused. Varun is the founder, but it was Amit Saxena who was behind its operations. We have applied for their remand in court to probe the case further, since we are yet to ascertain the number of victims directly affected by Ponzi scheme, the exact amount duped, number of people involved and the route where the amount was diverted to. Initial probe suggest that money was used in buying properties in Noida and Gurugram. These included flats and commercial places,\"" SSP Agra Kumar explained.\n\nThe company, according to police, duped people by means of a pyramid scheme -- that was started around October 2016 -- by asking people to click on 'www.webpagelike.com' and also view advertisements on Youtube, Instagram and Facebook. The scheme was offered under three broad plans of Rs 18,000, Rs 57,000 and Rs 1,15,000 and each 'like' would credit Rs 0.5 to Rs 2.7 into the scheme holder's account. It was compulsory for victims to ensure 350 'likes' a day for which they were paid Rs 230 to Rs 970 a day. The affected individuals were further asked to introduce the scheme to two other persons that would \""double their earnings\"". Interestingly, in 2016, Bollywood actress Zareen Khan had visited Agra to promote the IT firm.\n\nLast year, Agra police arrested three members of the firm. They included ENTITY, a Corporation Bank manager from Nabha, Punjab, along with bank's 'e-mitra' Gurjaat and chartered accountant Rahul of Delhi. Rahul was keeping a tab on the IT firm's money flow and creating fake paper trails of transactions to avoid suspicion from IT department.\n\nSources said that Saxena had completed his MBA from an Agra-based private engineering college located on the NH-2. Here, scores of alumnus have been arrested for murder, robbery and other crimes. While Varun is a graduate.\n\nThe SSP Agra added, \""During interrogation, the accused said that they borrowed the idea of floating IT firm and running Ponzi scheme from earlier scams like speakasia.com which robbed nearly 12 lakh investors for Rs 2,500 crore and Anubhav Mittal's Socialtrade.biz who made Rs 3,700 crore from direct investments of seven lakh people who were looking for a quick buck."

The rare Revolutionary War-era rifle stolen from a display case at Valley Forge State Park nearly 50 years ago has been returned to its rightful owners. Rachel Wisniewski/The New York Times.\n\nby Karen Zraick NEW YORK (NYT NEWS SERVICE ).- A rare Revolutionary War-era rifle stolen from a display case at Valley Forge State Park nearly 50 years ago has been returned to its rightful owners.\n\nThe 5-foot-long rifle was made in 1775 by Johann Christian Oerter, a master gunsmith at the Moravian settlement of Christian's Spring, near Nazareth, Pennsylvania. Only a few signed and dated rifles from that era survived, and Oerter's work is considered among the finest. A similar Oerter rifle belongs to the British Royal Collection Trust.\n\nThe FBI's art crime team and other law enforcement officials returned the antique on Friday to the Pennsylvania Society of Sons of the Revolution during a ceremony at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia. It will go on display there Wednesday.\n\n\The Christian Oerter rifle exhibits exemplary early American artistry, and is a reminder that courage and sacrifice were necessary to secure American independence,\"" R. Scott Stephenson, the museum's president, said in a statement.\n\nOfficials said the rifle was recovered with the help of Kelly Kinzle, an antiques dealer in New Oxford, Pennsylvania. Jay Robert Stiefel, a lawyer for Kinzle, said that his client bought the firearm last year as part of a collection. As he researched it, he found a reference to a stolen Oerter rifle in a 1980 book by George Shumway, an expert on antique long rifles who died in 2011. Kinzle then turned the rifle over to the FBI.\n\nWhen it was stolen in October 1971, the rifle was on loan to the Valley Forge Historical Society, the predecessor of the Philadelphia museum.\n\nIt was taken in broad daylight from what was thought to be a theft-proof display case at the visitor center at Valley Forge State Park, about 20 miles northwest of Philadelphia.\n\nNow administered by the National Park Service, the area was the site of a Continental Army encampment in the winter of 1777-78, under the leadership of Gen. George Washington. The period was a turning point in the war, as the soldiers became a coherent fighting unit, and Valley Forge became a symbol of the fight for independence.\n\nAn article in The Philadelphia Inquirer on Oct. 26, 1971, reported that the burglary had occurred weeks earlier but was not publicized because of concerns that the thief might panic and discard the rifle. At the time, it was insured for $15,000, roughly $95,000 today.\n\nThe thief managed to pry open the display case using a crowbar or similar instrument shortly after the museum opened at 9 a.m. on a Saturday, The Inquirer reported. A Boy Scout on a tour with his troop noticed it was missing some time later.\n\nOn Friday, the Montgomery County district attorney, Kevin Steele, noted that in 2009, the local police reopened an investigation into various burglaries and thefts of historic artifacts from Valley Forge in the 1960s and '70s. They teamed up with the FBI and other agencies and sought out collectors and scholars to help. Steele said that the local authorities remained committed to trying to solve those crimes.\n\nThe Moravian church is a Protestant denomination, and many adherents settled in Pennsylvania in the 1700s. Makers of \""Pennsylvania rifles,\"" which are also called \""Kentucky rifles,\"" had a strong influence on the development of American firearms.\n\nIn the 1980 book \""Rifles of Colonial America, Vol. I,\"" Shumway wrote that Oerter was an apprentice of Andreas Albrecht and took over from him at 19.

Goodwin Jewellers,0,"HARTFORD, Conn. (ChurchMilitant.com) - The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that frozen embryos are \""marital property\"" and can be destroyed, even over the objection of the biological father.\n\nTimothy ENTITY and Jessica Bilbao had undergone in-vitro fertilization while they were legally married, leading to the birth of a child. They decided to cryogenically preserve and store the rest of their embryonic children at a fertility clinic for future implantation. In the process, they made a contract with the clinic that in the event of divorce the embryos would be discarded.\n\nWhen Bilbao filed for divorce in 2016, a settlement was held up by ENTITY's decision to repudiate the agreement and oppose the destruction of their remaining (frozen) offspring. He decided he wanted their continued preservation in case he and Bilbao were to reconcile. As an alternative he was willing to donate them to another couple for them to adopt and raise. Bilbao maintained her wish that the embryos be \""discarded in accordance with the storage agreement.\""\n\nA lower court had ruled that the contract they made with the fertility clinic was invalid and unenforceable, but granted Bilbao legal possession of the embryos, stating that she had the stronger claim. The state Supreme Court subsequently ruled the original contract with the clinic was valid.\n\nIn his appeal, ENTITY argued that an embryo is not property and that, even if it were, the lower court should have ruled in his favor \""as the party seeking to preserve the pre-embryos because they are human beings.\""\n\nLabeling them \""pre-embryos,\"" the court said it would not consider questions about preserving human life, or what to do in future cases if no agreement is made.\n\n\""Because we conclude that the parties in this case had an enforceable agreement,\"" the court stated, \""we do not decide what a court must do in the absence of an enforceable agreement.\""\n\n\""For example,\"" it continued, \""we leave for another day whether, in the absence of an enforceable agreement, balancing or contemporaneous mutual consent is the appropriate approach, and what the details of such an approach would entail.\""\n\nJustifying their use of the term \""pre-embryo,\"" the court claimed in a footnote: \""Pre-embryo is a medically accurate term for a zygote or fertilized egg that has not been implanted in a uterus.\""\n\nJoseph Secola, ENTITY's attorney, said the court should have at least ordered a hearing to determine if the embryos had rights as people. \""Just relying on fact that there is a contract,\"" he said, \""given that human life is present, is just too simplistic. That's where I disagree with the court.\""\n\nDecrying society's use of technology without consideration of unforeseen consequences, Secola said, \""[T]he technology seems to outrun our ability to consider all the issues with it.\""\n\nFree clip from CHURCH MILITANT Premium\n\nWATCH MORE LIKE THIS\n\nCatholic teaching recognizes several moral problems within the case that objectively violate natural law.\n\nPutting aside the doctrine that marriage is indissoluble, in-vitro fertilization separates the unitive from the procreative significance of the marital act and, in effect, manufactures human beings by technological instruments, whereas spouses are called instead to accept the gift of a child as the fruit of the marital embrace.\n\nFor those with the cross of infertility, painful as it may be, adoption and other fulfilling ways to love are taught as morally upright options.\n\nEmbryo adoption is legitimately being debated among theologians. The notion of a wife pregnant with another man's (and woman's) child is seen by some as an infringement on the sanctity of marriage. Others claim the sanctity of human life and the innocence of the victims must also be taken into consideration.\n\nFinally, the intentional killing of any innocent human being, even if unborn or frozen, is intrinsically evil and objectively murder.\n\nAs long as those with power and self-interest are allowed to manipulate the language to popularize scientifically unsound concepts like \""pre-embryo,\"" civil law will fail to protect the innocent."
Goodwin Jewellers,0,"Even though a white dirty ex-cop reportedly bragged about killing his fiancée, a Black man the woman allegedly had a secret affair with has sat in prison for the past 21 years after being convicted of murdering her.\n\nRodney Reed, 51, is set to be executed Nov. 20 in the strangulation death of Stacey Stites, a white woman, April 23, 1996, in Bastrop County, Texas, according to the Innocence Project.\n\nThe nonprofit representing Reed and others it's fighting to see exonerated said on its website that the legal team for Reed filed an application for clemency Thursday with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.\n\nReed's attorneys asked in their application that the board recommend to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott a commutation of the inmate's death sentence in light of \""mounting new evidence of his innocence,\"" the Innocence Project said.\n\nCited in the application is a new sworn affidavit by fellow prison mate and neo-Nazi gang member, Arthur Snow of the Aryan Brotherhood.\n\nSnow, who was in prison for forgery, stated that the victim's fiancé, Jimmy Fennell, bragged about Stites' murder while Fennell was serving a 10-year prison sentence for kidnapping and sexual assaulting a woman in his custody in 2007, according to the Statesman.\n\n\""He was talking about his fiance with a lot of hatred and anger,\"" Snow said in the three-page affidavit. \""Jimmy said his fiance had been sleeping around with a black man behind his back.\""\n\nSo Fennell killed her, Snow alleged. He is the fourth new witness defense attorneys produced to halt Reed's execution, the Statesman reported.\n\nReed has maintained that he did not kill Stites.\n\n\""Early on I was somewhat upset, just for knowing her. If I wouldn't have known her, I wouldn't have been associated with her [and] I wouldn't be in this situation,\"" Reed told ABC News in a prison interview Wednesday. \""But, this is the situation that was handed to me so I have [to] accept ... that I did know her.\n\n\""I have to accept that there was a relationship. I have to accept that I'm here now for something that I didn't do.\""\n\nReed was convicted by an all-white jury when DNA from Stites' body matched Reed's, but the man admitted he was having an affair with the woman, according to The Guardian.\n\nSince his conviction in 1998, his case has attracted national attention and prompted a wide array of advocates to speak out on his behalf, including Sister Helen Prejean, a nun and anti-death penalty activist.\n\nShe tweeted Feb. 16, 2015:\n\n\""#RodneyReed has maintained his innocence for 18 years. Take a look at the case and you'll see why.\""\n\nReed's lead attorney, Bryce Benjet of the Innocence Project, said in September that the state's continued refusal to perform DNA testing of the murder weapon, a leather belt used to strangle Stites, violates Reed's constitutional rights, according to The Guardian.\n\nReed's legal team believes new evidence would prove that Jimmy Fennell, Stites' fiancé at the time of her death, was the murderer.\n\nProsecutors, however, have fought to deny the testing, arguing the belt had been contaminated after it was handled repeatedly during and after Reed's trial, according to the Statesman.\n\nSeveral items were also packaged with the murder weapon allowing potential DNA to mingle, prosecutors said, according to the newspaper.\n\nTexas Rep. Vikki ENTITY told The Guardian earlier this year she was lobbying for a retrial for Reed.\n\n\""I don't think anyone can say he is guilty without a shadow of a doubt,\"" she said. \""I don't believe we should carry out the death penalty when there's doubt about the truth of the case."

SOYLU Suleyman,0,"The House voted 405-11 on a resolution in favor of both recognizing and condemning the Ottoman Empire's killing of approximately 1.5 million Armenians from 1915 to 1923, an event that the Turkish government has historically denied and argued accusations about which did not take into account the deaths of Turks.\n\n\Many American politicians, diplomats and institutions have rightly recognized these atrocities as a genocide, including America's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire at the time, Henry Morgenthau, and Ronald Reagan,\"" House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY) said on the floor prior to the vote, according to The Hill.\n\nHe went on to assert that \""only by shining a light on the darkest parts of our history can we learn not to repeat them\"".\n\nThe bill's three main points declare the US will commemorate the Armenian genocide, reject \""efforts to enlist, engage\"" or associate in the denial of the genocide and work to educate the public on details surrounding the atrocity.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu fired back at the US lawmakers' backing of the resolution and accused them of \""exploiting history in politics\"".\n\nThe World War I-era genocide has been recognized by Russia, several European Union states and the World Council of Churches. Earlier this year, French President Emmanuel Macron moved to declare April 24 as the country's Day of Armenian Genocide Remembrance.\n\nIn another Tuesday bipartisan showing, the House, by a 403-16 vote, passed a resolution in favor of sanctions against Turkey over its Operation Peace Spring in Northern Syria. The bill, entitled \""Protect Against Conflict by Turkey Act\"", received overwhelming support from the Republican Party, with 176 GOP lawmakers voting in support and only 15 opposed.\n\n\""Rather than hold Turkey accountable for how they've conducted this bloody campaign, [US President Donald] Trump has given them a free pass,\"" Engel stated on Tuesday, as reported by The Hill.\n\n\""When the head of [ISIL, ISIS or Daesh] was finally killed, President Trump unfortunately thanked the Turks, thanked the Turkish government. That just doesn't sit right with me,\"" he added.\n\nCavusoglu also issued a statement in response to the House's move to impose sanctions on Ankara and claimed the measure went against the October 17 ceasefire deal brokered between the US and Turkey. The foreign minister went on to urge other Washington lawmakers to halt sanction efforts altogether and avoid a breakdown in bilateral ties.\n\n\""America is holding accountable top Turkish officials responsible for human rights abuses, including attacking our Kurdish partners,\"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi noted, reported USA Today.\n\n\""We're penalizing Turkish financial institutions who perpetuate President [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan's corruption and abuses,\"" she stated.\n\nSenator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) echoed the speaker's comments on Ankara and called on the US Senate to act with haste and advance the bill.\n\nThe bipartisan bill now moves on to the Senate; however, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has previously warned Congress to \""think extremely carefully\"" about rushing to sanction a NATO ally.\n\nWashington's previous sanctions on Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, Energy Minister Fatih Donmez and Interior Minister ENTITY were lifted by Trump last week after Ankara agreed to make the Northern Syria ceasefire permanent. The US president noted at the time that sanctions would be reinstated if Turkey did not honor their word and adhere to ceasefire obligations."
SOYLU Suleyman,1,"Statements of Administration officials suggest that additional U.S. sanctions measures against Turkey, as well as possible further general and specific licenses, are being contemplated.\n\nOn October 14, 2019, the Trump administration issued a new executive order that authorizes the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to designate on OFAC's list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (\""SDN List\"") Turkish officials and government entities and others that have engaged in actions resulting in serious human rights abuses in Syria or that threaten the peace, security, stability or territorial integrity of Syria.\n\nOFAC's first exercise of authority under this new executive order was the designation of two Turkish ministries (the Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and the Ministry of National Defence) and three Turkish ministers on the SDN List. As a result, U.S. persons are now broadly prohibited from dealing with these persons absent a license issued by OFAC and must block their property if it comes into the possession or control of U.S. persons. In addition, non-U.S. persons may be exposed to secondary sanctions for dealing with these parties. Concurrently, OFAC issued three general licenses that authorize certain transactions that would otherwise be prohibited under U.S. sanctions, including a 30-day period to wind-down certain existing business.\n\nThis client alert provides an overview of these recent measures and the possibility of additional sanctions measures that may be imposed against Turkey by the United States.\n\nThe new Executive Order signed on October 14, 2019, authorizes OFAC to designate on the SDN List: (1) current or former officials of the government of Turkey; (2) subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities of the government of Turkey; (3) persons operating in certain sectors of the Turkish economy to be specified by the U.S. government; and (4) other persons deemed to have threatened the peace, security, stability or territorial integrity of Syria or committed serious human rights abuses in Syria.\n\nThe Executive Order also provides the U.S. State Department and OFAC authority to impose secondary sanctions from a menu of options on other foreign persons determined to have engaged in other activities contributing to instability in Syria. These \""menu-based\"" sanctions include government procurement restrictions; visa restrictions; loan, banking and foreign exchange restrictions; SDN designations; investment restrictions; import prohibitions; and measures aimed at corporate officers.\n\nThe Executive Order also provides secondary sanctions authorities that allow the U.S. government to designate as SDNs persons who materially assist, sponsor or provide financial, material or technology support for, or goods or services to or in support of, SDNs and blocked persons under this Executive Order. Additionally, foreign financial institutions that knowingly facilitate significant transactions on behalf of SDNs or blocked persons could be subject to sanctions that restrict their access to U.S. correspondent or payable through accounts.\n\nPursuant to the authority granted under the new executive order, OFAC designated on the SDN List Turkey's Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and Ministry of National Defence. Additionally, OFAC designated the following three individual ministers of the Republic of Turkey as SDNs: (1) Hulusi Akar, the Minister of National Defence; (2) ENTITY, the Minister of Interior; and (3) Fatih Donmez, the Minister of Energy.\n\nAs a result of these actions, U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any business, transactions, contracts or other dealings with these Turkish ministries and ministers, as well as entities that they own 50 percent or more, unless authorized by OFAC by a general or specific license. Additionally, property or property interests of these ministries, ministers and entities owned 50 percent or more by them must be blocked if they come into the possession or control of a U.S. person.\n\nRecognizing the potential ramifications that these actions will likely have on Turkey's energy sector and U.S. companies doing business in this sector, OFAC noted in its press release that \""it is prepared to issue authorizations, such as general or specific licenses, as appropriate, to ensure that the new designations do not disrupt Turkey's ability to meet its energy needs.\""\n\nOFAC also issued three General Licenses that authorize certain transactions that would otherwise be prohibited under U.S. sanctions.\n\nOf particular importance, OFAC issued a 30-day \""Wind Down\"" General License (General License 2), which authorizes U.S. persons to engage in transactions and activities \""that are ordinarily incident and necessary to the wind down of operations, contracts, or other agreements involving the Ministry of National Defence or the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources . . . or any entity in which one or more of such ministries own, directly or indirectly, a 50 percent or greater interest,\"" provided such operations, contracts or agreements were in effect prior to October 14, 2019. This General License expires on November 13, 2019, meaning that U.S. persons must generally wind down their pre-sanctions operations, contracts and agreements with these ministries by that date.\n\nOFAC also issued General License 1, which authorizes U.S. persons to engage in transactions and activities otherwise prohibited by these sanctions \""that are for the conduct of the official business of the United States Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.\"" For example, this general license authorizes U.S. companies to engage in contracts with the U.S. government for official U.S. government business related to the Ministry of National Defence and Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, but it does not authorize sales of goods or services (including dual-use or military items) to such ministries that are not related to official U.S. government business, even if such sales are authorized under an export license issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce or U.S. Department of State.\n\nFurthermore, OFAC issued General License 3, which authorizes transactions and activities involving the Ministry of National Defence or the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (including entities owned 50 percent or more by such ministries) that are for the official business of the United Nations, its specialized agencies, and related organizations.\n\nSecretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin stated that although these sanctions are \""starting small,\"" they could become a \""maximum pressure\"" campaign that could \""destroy the Turkish economy.\"" It appears that additional sanctions measures may be under preparation at this time for possible implementation in the near future. In addition, several pending bills in Congress would, if enacted, mandate additional sanctions against Turkey. These pending bills continue to have bipartisan support, although it remains to be seen what effect the October 14 sanctions will have on Congressional consideration and further action on these bills.\n\nWith uncertainty on the ground in Syria and Turkey, additional pending sanction legislation, and continuing conflict between the Trump administration and Congress regarding the administration's recent actions associated with Turkey and Syria, the course and further development of this very new U.S. sanctions program remains unpredictable and may continue to quickly evolve."
ABU ZUBAYDAH,1,"A former commander of the most secretive part of the prison compound told how the accused plotters of the Sept. 11 attacks were guarded by a secret force dressed like U.S. troops.\n\nThis article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\n\nGUANTÁNAMO BAY, Cuba -- In the months after their arrival at Guantánamo in 2006 from years in C.I.A. detention, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and the other accused plotters of the Sept. 11 attacks were guarded by a secret force disguised as United States troops and kept isolated in individual cells, unable to communicate with each other, a former commander testified Friday.\n\nThe account of their early days at Guantánamo emerged in a pretrial hearing on Friday in the case of Mr. Mohammed and four other men accused of conspiring in the 2001 attacks. The commander's testimony amounted to the most comprehensive view yet of Guantánamo's most mysterious prison, known as Camp 7, and the secret unit, called Task Force Platinum, that has guarded it since its inception.\n\nLawyers for Mr. Mohammed and the other defendants want the judge to exclude from their death-penalty trial, scheduled to start in January 2021, what they told F.B.I. agents in early 2007, months after they got to Guantánamo. The defense lawyers say those interrogations -- carried out by what prosecutors say were \clean teams\"" from the F.B.I. who were unfamiliar with evidence unlawfully obtained from the defendants during the years they were in C.I.A. custody and subject to torture -- were in fact tainted by years of clandestine C.I.A.-F.B.I. collaboration.\n\nThe defense lawyers argue that the prisoners provided the same answers to F.B.I. agents in 2007 that they had previously given to the C.I.A. at black sites where they were punished for not cooperating, and did not believe, based on conditions at Guantánamo, that they had free choice to refuse.\n\nTo rebut the defense, prosecutors on Friday called the former Army officer who served as the first commander of Camp 7. He testified about how he took custody of the accused Sept. 11 plotters and other C.I.A. prisoners as they came off a C-17 cargo plane in the dark of night at Guantánamo in September 2006 and, starting four months later, had his troops shepherd them to the F.B.I. interrogations.\n\nThe prisoners were told on the eve of an interrogation that they had an appointment the following day, which they could chose to attend. The commander said he never told them they were to be F.B.I. interrogations but checked with them the next morning on whether they would go to the appointments. They took place at a portion of the Guantánamo prison compound called Camp Echo II.\n\nThe former Army officer, who came to court in a sports jacket and tie, testified anonymously at the insistence of case prosecutors. He described a security regime set up by the Bush administration in September 2006 as it acknowledged to the world, for the first time, that it had held and interrogated prisoners in secret sites around the world starting in 2002.\n\nAccounts of the violence the C.I.A. used in the black sites -- waterboarding, beatings, sleep deprivation, rectal abuse and hanging their captives by their wrists -- would emerge later.\n\nOnce at Guantánamo, according to the Camp 7 commander, the 14 prisoners were taken to their new cells, showered and provided with \""fresh clothes.\"" The prisoners included Mr. Mohammed as well as a Saudi man now awaiting a capital trial as the accused mastermind of Al Qaeda's 2000 bombing of the U.S.S. Cole warship of Yemen and a never-charged Palestinian man known as ENTITY, who was the first detainee to be waterboarded in C.I.A. custody.\n\nMost of the commander's testimony on Friday occurred in a hearing closed to journalists because prosecutors invoked a national security privilege over much of the information about how the prison was set up and who worked there.\n\nFor example, the former commander was forbidden to describe in open court what the 14 former black site captives were wearing or how they looked when they arrived in 2006. Nor did he explain in his testimony why the guards who worked for him on the cellblocks wore United States military uniforms but were not employees of the Defense Department, a remark that suggested they were C.I.A. agents or contractors disguised as soldiers.

NILETEL,1,"Global Magnitsky designations target government insiders engaging in bribery, kickbacks, and procurement fraud while draining state coffers\n\nWashington - Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Ashraf Seed Ahmed Al-Cardinal (Al-Cardinal) and Kur Ajing Ater (Ajing) for their involvement in bribery, kickbacks and procurement fraud with senior government officials. OFAC is also designating five companies determined to be owned or controlled by Al-Cardinal, and one company owned or controlled by Ajing. OFAC designated these individuals and entities pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13818, which builds upon and implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and targets perpetrators of serious human rights abuse and corruption.\n\n'These South Sudanese elites and corrupt government officials have drained state coffers and usurped the country's resources with impunity. Al-Cardinal and Ajing leverage their businesses and political connections to engage in corruption at great expense to the South Sudanese people,' said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. 'The South Sudanese government must take urgent measures to increase transparency and enforce accountability against those involved in systemic corruption. Privileged elites should not be allowed to profit from conflict as they undermine efforts to bring lasting peace to South Sudan.'\n\nAs a result of today's action, all property and interests in property of the individuals and entities named below, and of any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by them, individually, or with other designated persons, that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons, are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC or otherwise exempt, OFAC's regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. In addition, any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a U.S. person, wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited by E.O. 13818 if performed by a U.S. person or within the United States would be prohibited.\n\nASHRAF SEED AHMED AL-CARDINAL\n\nSudanese businessman Al-Cardinal has been used by a senior South Sudanese government official as an intermediary to deposit and hold a large amount of funds in a country outside of South Sudan. Following OFAC's designation of Benjamin Bol Mel in December 2017, the senior South Sudanese official began to use a bank account in the name of one of Al-Cardinal's companies to store his personal funds in an attempt to avoid the effects of potential sanctions designations. Further, in early 2019, the South Sudanese government made millions of dollars in payments to a company owned by Al-Cardinal; while the official reason was for the payment for food, the money instead went to senior South Sudanese government officials. Other South Sudanese government officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the massive corruption in the South Sudanese government, noting that although large amounts of money were paid to Al-Cardinal for supplies and provisions, government forces never seemed to be adequately supplied.\n\nSeparately, a company partially owned by Al-Cardinal has been publicly implicated in the importation of amphibious armored vehicles into South Sudan that gave the Government of South Sudan the ability to extend offensives that included violent attacks on innocent civilians.\n\nFive companies owned or controlled by Al-Cardinal were also designated today: Alcardinal General Trading Limited, Alcardinal General Trading LLC, Al Cardinal Investments Co. LTD, Alcardinal Petroleum Company limited, and ENTITY.\n\nAl-Cardinal is being designated for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery.\n\nKUR AJING ATER\n\nAjing is a South Sudanese businessman who has bribed key officials in the Government of South Sudan in order to maintain influence and access to the South Sudanese oil market. Ajing used these bribes to both curry favor with a senior gatekeeper within the Government of South Sudan and to ensure the silence and compliance of a key government officials. In late 2018, the South Sudanese government made a large cash payment to Ajing. While the official reason was for the payment of food, the money instead went directly to a senior South Sudanese government official. In addition, Ajing has been obligated large amounts of oil by the Government of South Sudan, and has given money and vehicles to government officials in return. Ajing has claimed to have paid senior officials millions of dollars and has cooperated with the request of a senior official to route oil payments in cash rather than through official bank accounts. Further, Ajing was the recipient of a multi-year contract to purchase food for the South Sudanese military, and in return, paid a percentage of the contract back to a senior South Sudanese government official. According to public media reports, Ajing received millions of dollars in contracts for the South Sudanese military, including one contract that alone exceeds the total amount budgeted for the military's goods and services for the year by a factor of ten.\n\nAjing is being designated for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, an entity that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery. One company owned or controlled by Ajing was also designated today: Lou Trading and Investment Company Limited.\n\nGLOBAL MAGNITSKY\n\nBuilding upon the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, on December 20, 2017, the President signed E.O. 13818, in which the President found that the prevalence of human rights abuse and corruption which have their source, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States, had reached such scope and gravity that it threatens the stability of international political and economic systems. Human rights abuse and corruption undermine the values that form an essential foundation of stable, secure, and functioning societies; have devastating impacts on individuals; weaken democratic institutions; degrade the rule of law; perpetuate violent conflicts; facilitate the activities of dangerous persons; and undermine economic markets. The United States seeks to impose tangible and significant consequences on those who commit serious human rights abuse or engage in corruption, as well as to protect the financial system of the United States from abuse by these same persons.\n\nTo date, the Department of the Treasury has designated 122 individuals and entities under E.O. 13818. This figure is in addition to the numerous human rights or corruption related designations Treasury has issued under other various authorities. In total, since January of 2017, Treasury has taken action against more than 680 individuals and entities with links to human rights abuse or corruption.\n\nFor more information on the individuals and entities designated today, click here.\n\n####\n\nAttachments\n\nOriginal document Permalink\n\nDisclaimer\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury published this content on 11 October 2019 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

Cosco Shipping Tanker,0,"""This suggests that the fluctuation in oil purchases is not related to a system-wide disruption in China-Iran trade such as the banking difficulties that stymied commerce late last year. Additionally, Chinese exports to Iran did not decline month-on-month in September.\n\nAccording to data provided by TankerTrackers.com, fewer barrels of oil were observed departing Iran in August than in July. Observed exports amounted to around 670,000 bpd in August, down by about 130,000 bpd from the previous month. This drop in observed exports offers one explanation as to why Chinese declared imports of Iranian oil were lower in September than in August -- export levels in a given month tend to appear as declared imports in the following month given the four week journey of tankers at sea.\n\nNotably, any decision to scale back imports of Iranian oil in September would have predated the Trump administration's move to sanction tanker subsidiaries of Chinese state shipping giant ENTITY involved in the transport of Iranian oil. The Chinese government has reportedly asked the Trump administration to remove sanctions on ENTITY as part of its ongoing trade negotiations.\n\nIn July, U.S. officials had publicly expressed concern about continued Chinese purchases of Iranian oil, suggesting that China was given prior warning that its tanker fleet could be targeted with sanctions designations. This may have spurred China to reduce the use of its own VLCC tankers in the transport of Iranian oil. The fleet of the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) has long been the primary means by which Iranian oil is exported to China, but having fewer Chinese tankers picking up oil from terminals in Iran would nonetheless reduce export capacity, depressing overall imports.\n\nHowever, data on observed exports from Iran does not correspond to the drop in declared imports in September's customs data. The value of the observed exports is considerably higher than the USD 250 million in Chinese purchases declared for September. The market value of Iran's August exports is over USD 1.2 billion. Syria is the only other customer currently purchasing Iranian oil and imports significantly less than China. So where is the additional oil going?"

Cosco Shipping Tanker,1,"Last month, the US Department of the Treasury announced the ENTITY Company and ENTITY Seaman and Ship Management Company met the requirements for new sanctions under Executive Order 13846, which reimposed sanctions with respect to Iran.\n\nUS Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, claimed the Chinese state owned shipping company had knowingly violated US restrictions on handling Iranian oil. The surprise announcement threw global shipping markets into turmoil, raised oil transport prices on the world's oceans, and negatively affected the global community by denying the freedom to engage in trade through the peaceful circulation of legitimate goods.\n\nYet the US claims to uphold the freedom of the seas as a historic right, based on the Grotian principles of free trade, which involves equitable and peaceful rights to engage in trade and circulate goods.\n\nWithout the ability for customers to utilize US financial exchange systems for US dollar transactions involving ENTITY Companies, the sanctions result in their owned and operated vessels effectively being blocked from circulating oil, a legitimate commodity on the world market.\n\nWhile there are many different grades and types of oil produced for the global market, two Western crude oils dominate. The US' WTI and UK's Brent Crude are the benchmarks for purchases of oil worldwide, traded in US dollars. As the global currency for the trade of a major energy source, the US dollar can have a dramatic effect on oil pricing, and the ability of countries to trade in the commodity.\n\nThe US is not a maritime power and holds only a small portion of the world merchant marine fleet. From its highest level at 16.9 percent in 1960 with 2,926 vessels, to approximately 0.4 percent with 182 vessels of the world's merchant vessels operating under the US flag in 2019.\n\nWhile the US Navy is the largest naval force globally, its ability to project force under freedom of navigation laws does not affect merchant trade during peacetime, and does not compensate for the miniscule US merchant fleet.\n\nChina is a large maritime power, holding the second largest merchant marine fleet behind Greece. With 7,744 vessels as of August 2018, the employment patterns of Chinese flagged or owned vessels in the \carrying trade,\"" when China is not the voyage origin or destination, is significant.\n\nTo find a comparison in US merchant marine history with China's ability to trade globally today, it is necessary to examine the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century. Outside of the unnatural trading patterns created by the late 19th century US colonial period, it has now been two centuries since the US occupied the position China holds in merchant marine shipping.\n\nWith US inability to circulate goods in the maritime realm, it is in a difficult position, as payment for other nation states to engage in the world's largest national consumer market causes capital outflow. The US has, through governmental domestic policies and those of US merchant shipping companies, been placed in a position where it can no longer be considered a maritime power.\n\nHowever, the ability to block the circulation of global currency provides an opportunity to prevent others to operate, as ENTITY (Dalian) has discovered. With the company's oil tankers being unable to engage in the world's oil trade through the unilateral actions of the US, a virtual blockade has been implemented, without the use of the US Navy.\n\nFreedom of the seas, the ability to circulate goods around the globe, has been interrupted not through force, merely though the ability of one country to interrupt the flow of financial instruments involved in transactions outside its borders.\n\nAs Hugo Grotius said, people are not to be deprived of sovereignty over their possessions due to political or religious differences, since sovereignty is a matter of positive law. It is possible to look further for advice with \""Ubi societas, ibi jus,\"" wherever there is a social structure, you will find law.\n\nThe US attempts to sanction ENTITY and prevents to company from circulating goods freely and making use of the wares and products it possesses should be considered in this light. It should not be considered with the words of US Rear Admiral John Hayes, who said in 1962; \""It does seem time that the whole idea of freedom of the seas be reviewed by the Nation and the Navy that is alone able to control the seas.\""\n\nDenial of a state's ability to enjoy the benefits of maritime power through control of financial transaction services is a naval blockade, and denial of sovereignty via other means, which can be considered as a denial of the right of a maritime power to engage in trade.\n\nAs Grotius stated over a century before the US emerged as a nation, \""It does not matter if there any differences based upon religion or political structure, all nations have the right to freely circulate goods upon the seas.\""\n\nSource:"

These regimes have taken International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans and are under the thumb of international finance, which is against the interests of people.After the embattled President of Ecuador claimed that President Nicolas Maduro was the cause of the massive protests against him, Maduro made clear what was occurring in Latin America, saying:\n\nWe have two models: the IMF model which privatizes everything and takes away the people's rights to health, education and work; and the humanist-progressive model which is emerging in Latin America and has the Bolivarian Revolution at the forefront.\n\nMaduro's clear understanding of the conflict is why it has been so important for the US to remove him. His success in defeating ongoing US coup attempts is a model guiding Latin America to a future independent of US domination.\n\nEcuadorians celebrate the repeal of Decree 883 (From Twitter)\n\nEcuador in Rebellion Against IMF and the US Puppet Moreno\n\nOn October 4, Moreno proclaimed the end of a 40-year policy of fuel and petrol subsidies, which had traditionally benefited his country's working-class population. He also announced a 20 percent decrease in the salary of public employees and initiated plans to privatize pensions. He removed workplace and job security safeguards. Decree 883, known as 'The Package', was a series of neoliberal policies demanded by the IMF in return for a $4.2 billion dollar loan. It was preceded by policies for the wealthy including reducing their taxes.\n\nThe IMF loan was part of Moreno serving as a puppet and bowing to multiple US demands. Ecuador promised to settle a long dispute with ENTITY whose oil drilling and pipelines have polluted the country. Tens of billions of dollars in restitution from ENTITY are at stake but Moreno said he is willing to give them up. In fact, the IMF loan is strange in that it was dependent on Ecuador paying external debt obligations; i.e., it was not new funds for Ecuador but new debt to subsidize paying back Wall Street.\n\nIn making the announcement, Moreno called the people \Zánganos,\"" or Drone Bees leading to the uprising of the Drone Bees. The mass protests were called by the Popular Front, a group of unions, and the Unified Workers Federation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE). Students and social movements joined protests throughout the nation in Loja, Guayaquil, Cuenca, Ambato, and Riobamba, among other cites as well as Quito, the capital. Moreno claimed without any evidence that the uprising was financed by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Correa.\n\nProtests in Ecuador were relentless with no end in sight. They grew when 20,000 indigenous people marched into Quito. Police responded with violence, tear gas, and mass arrests. An October 4 video circulated on social media showed nonviolent protesters killed in the street by the police as well as other police violence. On October 5, Moreno declared a 60-day state of Emergency. Sometimes police had to retreat in the face of mass protests. On October 7, Moreno fled the capital to hide in the Navy base 260 miles away in the conservative stronghold of Guayaquil.\n\nAs we wrote this newsletter, unrest in Ecuador was escalating. On Saturday, the nation was put on military lockdown. Law enforcement attacked protesters with pellets and tear gas in the immediate vicinity of the National Assembly. By Sunday, Moreno decreed a 3:00 pm curfew, which people defied. Then, facing an emergency session in the National Assembly, Moreno backed down. Protesters celebrated when Moreno's government announced that Decree 883 had been repealed after eleven days of popular mobilizations.\n\nPeter Koenig describes a root cause of the problems:\n\nSince January 2000, Ecuador's economy is 100% dollarized, compliments of the IMF (entirely controlled by the US Treasury, by force of an absolute veto). The other two fully dollarized Latin American countries are El Salvador and Panama.\n\nThe US and IMF used the economic crises of the 1990s to dollarize Ecuador's economy and gain full control over the nation's riches as Ecuador is the second-largest oil economy in South America. This led to unaffordable goods for Ecuadorians, social unrest and a series of unstable governments until President Correa, who served from 2007 to 17, was elected.\n\nA Center for Economic and Policy Research 2017 report found under Correa Ecuador did well with an average annual GDP growth of 1.5% compared to 0.6% average for the previous 26 years; a decline of 38% in poverty with extreme poverty reduced by 47%; and a decline in inequality with the Gini coefficient falling substantially. Correa doubled social spending from 4.3% in 2006 to 8.6% in 2016; tripling education spending from 0.7% to 2.1%; and, increasing public investments from 4% of GDP in 2006 to 10% in 2016.\n\nCorrea served two terms. A third term would have required a constitutional amendment. Rather than running, Correa endorsed Lenin Moreno who had served as his vice president from 2007-13. He was expected to continue Correa's policies but instead reversed them.\n\nMoreno was unpopular before announcing 'The Package' due to structural poverty increasing from 23.1 percent in June 2017 to 25.5 percent in June 2019 with projections of 30 percent by the end of the year. Injustices like the imprisonment of the popular former Vice President Jorge Glas on dubious charges and his continuous political witch hunt against Rafael Correa and other leaders of the Citizens' Revolution Party added to his unpopularity. In addition, he has been engulfed in a personal corruption crisis involving an offshore Shell ENTITY INA, which cast Moreno's presidency in doubt.\n\nMoreno's forcible and illegal ejection of Julian Assange from the London embassy in return for payoffs from the US and UK resulted in a national strike in Ecuador in July. This, along with the arrest of Ola Bini, who is being prosecuted falsely as a conspirator with Wikileaks, was unpopular with Ecuadorians.\n\nWill repeal of 'The Package' end the protests and the threat to Moreno's presidency? As we write, the answer to these questions are unclear. The people won a major victory, but the Moreno/IMF infection remains.\n\nRally in Argentina (By Enfoque Rojo)\n\nLatin Americans Rising Against the Right and US Domination\n\nLatin American countries are rejecting neoliberalism and US domination using multiple strategies to achieve change.\n\nThis month the deepening anti-capitalist movement in Bolivia is set to strengthen with the probable re-election of Evo Morales on October 20. Argentina is expected to remove right-wing President Mauricio Macri on October 27 and replace him with Alberto Fernandez. And, Mexico put in place its first progressive, left-of-center government with the election of Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) on July 1, 2018. Elections are also upcoming in Uruguay on October 27 and in Peru in January. Venezuela may have National Assembly elections in January as well.\n\nBolivia's Evo Morales has a 13-point lead in polls as his governing party Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) looks to re-election for a third Morales term that will last until 2025. Morales has 38.8 percent, just 1.2 percent short of the 40 percent required for a first-round victory in the upcoming elections. The survey also indicated majority support for the nationalization of gas and strategic industries, 51 percent say that public ownership is positive for the economy. On social programs, 61.7 percent say they are essential for providing dignity to those of low incomes.\n\nMorales has launched a large reforestation plan and put in place a model healthcare program. He is under attack from the United States and segments of Bolivia. Morales leads an independent, sovereign Bolivia that has rejected US dominance, decolonized and displaced neoliberalism. A recent color revolution attempt by the wealthy, with the support of the US and western powers, failed.\n\nArgentina's first round of voting on August 11 resulted in Fernandez, running with former president Cristina Kirchner, finishing 15 percent ahead of Macri. The surprising landslide brought into question Macri's ability to govern between now and the election. As a result, the IMF put a $5.4 billion dollar loan on hold part of the $56.3 billion stand-by agreement signed in mid-2018. Fernandez opposed the loan, which required sharp budget cuts affecting public services at a time of increasing poverty.\n\nUnder Macri, the economy has gone into crisis with poverty increasing to a record 36.4 percent, a recession accompanied by a 47 percent inflation rate in 2018 and an inflation rate of 25.1 percent during the first seven months of this year. Argentina's unemployment is at the highest level in 14 years. Poverty was at 19.7 percent when Kirchner left office in 2015. Fernandez has put forward an anti-hunger plan, not dependent on the IMF. Three weeks before the election, thousands of people rallied in Buenos Aires as the Workers Left Front sent a message of opposition to neoliberalism and austerity to the two major political parties.\n\nIn Mexico, AMLO won a landslide 53 percent of the vote on July 31 ending decades of right-wing rule. People were fed up with the corruption, impunity, and violence -- decades of loss of rights, pillaging and destruction of the nation's wealth and public enterprises. At his inauguration, AMLO decried 36 years of neoliberalism and public and private corruption, promised a \""peaceful and radical\"" transition with \""indigenous people as its priority,\"" in a government \""for the good of all, first the poor.\"" His fight against neoliberalism is challenged by NAFTA II (or the USMCA), as AMLO is careful not to confront Trump on this. On border policy, AMLO offered migrants home in Mexico and urged investment in Central America.\n\nThe Zapatistas have conflicted with AMLO over the exploitation of resources and the use of the military in policing, demanding its autonomy based on indigenous principles but he has sought diplomacy with them. AMLO has also faced massive strikes of tens of thousands of autoworkers, workers at US companies in Mexico and wildcat strikes at the border. AMLO has been a counterweight to US aggression in Latin America standing with Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba.\n\nPeru is in the midst of a crisis. President Martin Vizcarra who came into office after a corruption scandal removed his predecessor, dissolved the Congress, a move supported by the left, because it is controlled by far-right politician Keiko Fujimori and was preventing Vizcarra's anti-corruption campaign. Congress ignored the president's order and voted to remove him from office instead. The vice president resigned rather than take over and Vizcarra remains in office with the support of the military. He has now called for new congressional elections to be held on January 26. Vizcarra is a conservative battling the oligarchic right. The left, which has been divided, is coalescing around the Popular National Assembly and allying with social movements. The movements want an end to neoliberal policies, a Constituent Assembly to draft a new Constitution and to break with Washington's domination.\n\nIn Central America, Honduras has been in revolt against the coup government of Juan Orlando Hernandez (JOH), which for ten years has put in place neoliberalism, repression, and violence. Protests have been ongoing since his coup and fraudulent re-election. This summer, protests intensified with a national strike over austerity and privatization measures required by an IMF loan, leading to a 66-day uprising. The US has trained Honduran police to use repressive measures in an attempt to stop the protests, but their actions feed more protests.\n\nMany have fled Honduras in caravans to escape the corruption and violence. Now, a coalition of civil groups is urging the president's departure over a scandal ignited by accusations of large-scale drug trafficking to the United States being litigated against the president's brother Juan Antonio \""Tony\"" Hernandez. In the trial, several witnesses have declared JOH's campaign was financed with drug money, and that he took millions in bribes from various Mexican drug lords, including the infamous Joaquin \""El-Chapo\"" Guzman. The Liberal Party joined in calling for his resignation and protests have intensified. The trial may be the end of this cocaine-fueled presidency.\n\nBrazil's election of Bolsonaro has been marred by scandal now that the corruption of Operation Car Wash has been exposed. Private conversations between the prosecutors and then-judge Sergio Moro, now Super Minister of Justice, show that former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was the \""victim of a conspiracy\"" to prevent him from running against Bolsonaro. In the secret exchanges, Moro admitted that the corruption case was designed to frame him. Lula has said the US is behind the conspiracy.\n\nCalls to free Lula are increasing and the Supreme Court will be reviewing the case. Lula is demanding his record be cleared and refused a panicked offer from prosecutors that he be freed from jail and put under house arrest. Bolsonaro is also under attack for the Amazon fires, for an increase in police killings, for genocide against the Indigenous and for attacks on public education. Former President Michel Temer acknowledged that the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff, the Worker's Party leader, was a coup d'etat.\n\nNicaragua survived a 2018 US coup attempt and the revolution continues to thrive after 40 years of independence from US domination after US-backed dictator Anastasio Somoza fled. People were very confused about what happened in the 2018 coup attempt as media misinformation was prevalent. A group of us joined and produced a reader to help people understand the reality of Nicaragua. Peace is coming back to Nicaragua, even though continued pressure from the US is expected in the form of new illegal sanctions.\n\nVenezuela, which we have reported on intensively for years, has also survived ongoing coup attempts that continue to escalate in the post-John Bolton era of the Trump administration most recently with a threat of war through the Organization of American States (OAS). They are prepared for a military attack and have created new alliances to overcome the US economic war. This week, Russia announced it was investing $16.5 billion in Venezuela by the end of 2019.\n\nRussia has provided anti-missile defense systems, is keeping Navy ships in Venezuela to deter a US blockade and has helped gather intelligence on US actions. With their help, Venezuela has uncovered terrorist plots coming from Colombia and involving US-puppet Juan Guiado's team. Guaido has faltered and failed time and again, and now is being investigated for ties to Colombian drug traffickers and corruption.\n\nThe non-aligned movement of 120 nations met in Caracas this summer and expressed support for Venezuelan sovereignty. Venezuela has been a lynchpin for left movements in Latin America. When oil prices were high, it shared its wealth not only with poorest Venezuelans but with other countries seeking to challenge US and oligarch domination. Even in the midst of an escalating economic war with the United States, they continue to provide housing, food, and essentials to their people.\n\nIn the Caribbean, Cuba is challenged by the US economic war but continues its revolution. Mass protests in Haiti threaten the survival of the government and Puerto Rico's revolt removed a governor.\n\nCuba, despite the increasing US economic war, continues to be a bulwark against US imperialism, standing with governments like Venezuela and Nicaragua when they are under attack. Cuba completed a successful transition to a new president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, and voted on a new constitution developed using a participatory process involving 9 million people through 133,000 citizen meetings. The constitution includes \""universal and free health, education, sports and recreation, culture and respect for human dignity.\"" Cuba is currently facing major economic challenges as the US is blocking their access to oil. Russia and Venezuela are helping Cuba overcome this oil blockade.\n\nHaiti has been in protest since April calling for an end to neoliberal US domination and the resignation of Jovenel Moise. The president has not spoken in public since the beginning of this latest round of protests and this week he named a commission of seven politicians to lead discussions for a solution to end the crisis.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, a colony of the United States, massive protests led to Governor Ricardo A. Rosselló resigning on July 22, 2019. People also want the corrupt legislature cleaned out, the Fiscal Control Board, created by Obama, ended and the debt to be audited. Former political prisoner, Luis Rosa, said three things are needed: \""decolonization, an end to our colonial status through a constitutional assembly; health care, free for all Puerto Rican citizens; and free public education up through the university level.\""\n\nStephen Sefton wrote a country-by-country review of Latin America and the Caribbean in June describing the decline of the United States in the region and how changes were coming to many nations. He predicted that we are seeing \""the last throw of the dice for the US to retain its accustomed power and influence against the relentless fundamental drive for emancipation by the region's impoverished majority.\""\n\nRafael Correa said: \""Neoliberalism is what failed, not socialism of the 21st century, on the contrary, socialism of the 21st century is what has us firmly on our feet, withstanding all of these difficulties.\"" This hemisphere is a key battleground in the conflict between neoliberalism v Socialism and US dominance v. independence. People are demanding democracy from the bottom up and a fair economy that meets their needs."
Chevron Corporation,1,"Chris Hedges, an ordained Presbyterian minister, gave this sermon Sunday at the Claremont Presbyterian Church in Claremont, Calif.\n\nImmanuel Kant coined the term \radical evil.\"" It was the privileging of one's own interest over that of others, effectively reducing those around you to objects to be manipulated and used for your own ends. But Hannah Arendt, who also used the term \""radical evil,\"" saw that it was worse than merely treating others as objects. Radical evil, she wrote, rendered vast numbers of people superfluous. They possessed no value at all. They were, once they could not be utilized by the powerful, discarded as human refuse.\n\nWe live in an age of radical evil. The architects of this evil are despoiling the earth and driving the human species toward extinction. They are stripping us of our most basic civil liberties and freedoms. They are orchestrating the growing social inequity, concentrating wealth and power in the hands of a cabal of global oligarchs. They are destroying our democratic institutions, turning elected office into a system of legalized bribery, stacking our courts with judges who invert constitutional rights so that unlimited corporate money invested in political campaigns is disguised as the right to petition the government or a form of free speech. Their seizure of power has vomited up demagogues and con artists including Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, each the distortion of a failed democracy. They are turning America's poor communities into internal militarized colonies where police carry out lethal campaigns of terror and use the blunt instrument of mass incarceration as a tool of social control. They are waging endless wars in the Middle East and diverting half of all discretionary spending to a bloated military. They are placing the rights of the ENTITY above the rights of the citizen.\n\nArendt captured the radical evil of a corporate capitalism in which people are rendered superfluous -- surplus labor as Karl Marx said -- and pushed to the margins of society where they and their children are no longer considered to have value, value always determined by the amount of money produced and amassed. But as the Gospel of Luke reminds us, \""what is prized by human beings is an abomination in the sight of God.\""\n\nWho are those who would sacrifice us on the altar of global capitalism? How did they amass the power to deny us a voice, to insist that the earth is an inert commodity they have a right to exploit until the ecosystem that sustains life collapses and the human species, along with most other species, becomes extinct?\n\nThese architects of radical evil have been here from the beginning. They are the slaveholders who crammed men, women and children into the holds of ships and sold them in auctions in Charleston and Montgomery, rending families apart, taking from them their names, language, religion and culture. They wielded the whips, the chains, the dogs and the slave patrols. They orchestrated the holocaust of slavery, and when slavery was abolished, after a war that left 700,000 dead, they used convict leasing -- slavery by another name -- along with lynching and black codes, to carry out a reign of terror that continues today in our deindustrialized cities and our prisons. Black and brown bodies are worth nothing to our corporate masters when on the streets of our decayed cities, but locked in cages they each generate 50 or 60 thousand dollars a year. Some people say the system does not work. They are wrong. The system works exactly as it is designed to work.\n\nThese architects of radical evil are the white militias and Army units that stole the land, decimated the herds of buffalo, signed the treaties that were promptly violated and carried out a campaign of genocide against indigenous people, penning the few who remained in prisoner of war camps. They are the gun thugs, Baldwin-Felts and Pinkerton agents who gunned down, by the hundreds, American workers struggling to organize, forces of the kind that today oversee the bonded labor of workers in China, Vietnam and Bangladesh. They are the oligarchs, J.P. Morgan, Rockefeller and Carnegie, who paid for these rivers of blood, and who today, like Tim Cook at Apple and Jeff Bezos at Amazon, amass staggering fortunes from human misery.\n\nWe know these architects of radical evil. They are the DNA of American capitalism. You can find them on the commodity desks at Goldman Sachs. The financial firm's commodities index is the most heavily traded in the world. These traders buy up futures of rice, wheat, corn, sugar and livestock and jack up the commodity prices by as much as 200% on the global market so that the poor in Asia, Africa and Latin America can no longer afford basic staples, and starve. Hundreds of millions of people go hungry to feed this mania for profit, this radical evil that sees human beings, including children, as worth nothing.\n\nThese architects of radical evil extract the coal, oil and gas, poisoning our air, soil and water, while demanding huge taxpayer subsidies and blocking the urgent transition to renewable energy. They are the massive ENTITYs that own the factory farms, egg hatcheries and dairy farms where tens of billions of animals endure horrendous abuse before being needlessly slaughtered, part of an animal agriculture industry that is one of the leading multi-factorial causes of climate catastrophe. They are the generals and arms manufacturers. They are the bankers, hedge fund managers and global speculators who looted $7 trillion from the U.S. treasury after the pyramid schemes and fraud they carried out imploded the global economy in 2007-2008. They are the goons in state security who make us the most spied-upon, watched, monitored and photographed population in human history. When your government watches you 24 hours a day you cannot use the word \""liberty.\"" This is the relationship between a master and a slave.\n\nCorporate culture serves a faceless system. It is, as Hannah Arendt wrote, \""the rule of nobody and for this very reason perhaps the least human and most cruel form of rulership.\"" It will stop at nothing. Anyone or any movement that attempts to impede their profits will be targeted for obliteration. These architects of radical evil are incapable of reform. Appealing to their better nature is a waste of time. They don't have one. They have rigged the system, elections dominated by corporate money, the courts, the press a vast burlesque show for profit, which is why they spend so much time focused on Trump. There is no way to vote against the interests of Goldman Sachs or Exxon, Shell, BP and ENTITY, which along with the other top 20 fossil fuel ENTITYs have contributed 35% of all energy-related carbon dioxide and methane emissions worldwide -- 480 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent since 1965.\n\nWe know these architects of radical evil. They have been and always will be with us.\n\nBut who are those who resist? Where do they come from? What historical, social and cultural forces created them?\n\nThey too are familiar. They are Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner, John Brown, Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass. They are Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse and Chief Joseph. They are Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Emma Goldman. They are \""Big Bill\"" Haywood, Joe Hill and Eugene V. Debs. They are Woody Guthrie, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Ella Baker and Fannie Lou Hamer. They are Andrea Dworkin and Caesar Chavez. They are those who from the beginning fought back, often to be defeated by this radical evil but knowing they were called to defy it, even at the cost of their own reputations, financial security, social standing and sometimes their lives.\n\nThe architects of radical evil are disemboweling every last social service program funded by the taxpayers, from education to Social Security, because lives that do not swell their profits are considered superfluous. Let the sick die. Let many of the poor -- 41 million people, including children -- go to bed hungry. Let families be tossed into the streets. Let the young graduate have no meaningful employment. Let the U.S. prison system, with 25% of the world's prison population, swell. Let torture continue. Let assault rifles proliferate to fuel the epidemic of mass shootings. Let the roads, bridges, dams, levees, power grids, rail lines, subways, bus services, schools and libraries crumble or close. Let the rising temperatures, the freak weather patterns, the monster cyclones and hurricanes, the droughts, the flooding, the tornadoes, the wildfires, the melting polar ice caps, the poisoned water systems and the polluted air worsen until the species dies."
Chevron Corporation,1,"The man is so beautifully bland. In fact, I'd wager that only a tiny segment of Americans could name the current Secretary of Defense - and far fewer could pick him out of a lineup. Perhaps that's the point. President Trump, a celebrity ham, has tired of sharing the stage with big-name advisers such as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and national security adviser John Bolton. So they're both gone. In their place, Trump has installed faceless bureaucrats to run the most powerful national security state in human history. And the rest of us hardly notice.\n\nTrump's appointment of Mark Esper as head of the largest and most active Cabinet department, and the new Defense Secretary's near unanimous approval by the U.S. Senate, is no less of a scandal than Trump's apparent efforts to seek foreign interference in the 2020 elections. Only it isn't.\n\nStill, the nomination of Esper, a recent lobbyist for the defense contracting ENTITY Raytheon, ranks as one of the most egregious illustrations of the \revolving door\"" between lobbyists and the Defense Department. It's crony capitalism in fatigues, and while nothing new, a clear indication that things have only worsened under our reality-show-mogul-president.\n\nOf course, seen through the rose-colored glasses of American empire, Esper is highly qualified to head the Defense Department. He's a West Point graduate, former Army infantry officer, recipient of a master's degree in public administration from Harvard and a doctorate in public policy from George Washington University, and has past experience working in the Pentagon.\n\nIf one digs further, however, Esper is wildly problematic -- loaded with conflicts of interest, a veteran of the (should be) discredited neoconservative Bush-era DOD, and little more than a corporate \""company man.\"" He didn't just work for Raytheon, he lobbied on the defense contractor's behalf only recently. Under rather sharp questioning by Sen. Elizabeth Warren during his confirmation hearings, Esper refused to recuse himself from participating in government business involving Raytheon. In typically lifeless language, Esper replied that \""On the advice of my ethics folks at the Pentagon, the career professionals: No, their recommendation is not to.\"" How's that for accepting responsibility? No matter, he was swiftly and quietly confirmed by a vote of 90-8 in the Senate.\n\nExpect another banner year for Raytheon. It's already the third-largest US defense contractor, and produces, among other tools of destruction, Paveway precision-guided missiles -- the very weapons that Congress recently sought to stop shipping to Saudi Arabia due to (rather tardy) concerns about the heads of Yemeni civilians upon which they're dropped.\n\nI predict more deals and more taxpayer billions for Raytheon with Esper at the Defense helm. Not that the company has done poorly during the Trump years. In 2018, Raytheon CEO Thomas Kennedy candidly quipped that \""It's the best time that we've ever seen for the defense industry.\"" Not for indebted taxpayers, bombed-out Middle Easterners or US soldiers still dying in endless wars, it's not. But sure, it truly is the best of times for what prominent American leaders -- once upon a time -- labeled the \""merchants of death.\""\n\nConflicts of interest, sliding seamlessly between defense contracting boards and the Pentagon, and securing post-government largesse on corporate boards, that's an old story indeed. Looking back to 2001, most Defense Secretaries have troublesome private sector connections. Donald Rumsfeld entered the Pentagon after a 24-year business career; Robert Gates was on the board of directors of Fidelity Investments and the Parker Drilling Company; Chuck Hagel served on the boards of ENTITY and Deutsche Bank; Ash Carter -- an exception -- was mostly an academic and a bureaucratic wonk, but still consulted for Goldman Sachs. All made millions.\n\nThat covers the Bush and Obama years. What we've seen in the Trump administration, is, however, something far more brazen. His three Secretaries of Defense (one of whom, Patrick Shanahan, was only acting head) have been unapologetically ensconced in the world of defense contracting and corporate lobbying.\n\n\""Saint\"" Jim Mattis had, while still a general, encouraged the military to buy the blood test products of Theranos, then dropped the service and joined its corporate board. But Theranos' products did not work, the deal described by the Securities and Exchange Commission as an \""elaborate, years-long fraud.\"" Mattis also served, both before and after his Pentagon stint, on the board of General Dynamics, the nation's fifth largest defense contractor. Nonetheless, Mattis easily slid through his confirmation and was praised by all types of mainstream media as the administration's \""adult in the room.\""\n\nAfter Mattis resigned, he being unable to countenance even Trump's hints at modest withdrawal from the wars in Syria and Afghanistan, Patrick Shanahan stepped in as interim defense chief. Unlike his predecessor, Shanahan didn't emerge from the military, but rather from yet another defense contractor, Boeing, for which he's worked some 30 years. Trump thought that was dandy and nominated him to officially replace Mattis, but Shanahan decided to withdraw due to alleged personal scandals. Enter Mark Esper, Raytheon lobbyist extraordinaire.\n\nEsper's in good company in Washington's military-industrial swamp. Recent reports by the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) -- a vital organization that hardly any American has heard of -- identified \""645 instances in the past 10 years in which a retired senior official, member of Congress or senior legislative staff member became employed as a registered lobbyist, board member or business executive at a major government contractor.\"" POGO also noted that \""those walking through the revolving door included 25 generals, nine admirals, 43 lieutenant generals and 23 vice admirals.\""\n\nAll of which begs some questions and provides some disturbing answers. Perhaps we ought to ditch the myth that the Defense Secretary simply heads the Pentagon, and admit that Esper is really the emperor of a far grander military-industrial complex that includes a veritable army of K-Street lobbyists and venal arms dealers. Maybe it's time to concede that unelected national security czars, and not a stalemated bought-and-sold Congress, run national defense and set the gigantic Pentagon budget. Perhaps we should confess to ourselves that the nation's vaunted soldiers are little more than political pawns in a game that's far bigger, far more Kafkaesque, than those troopers could begin to fathom. And, finally, let's admit one last thing: Few of us care."
Kadmon Holdings,0,"NEW YORK, Oct. 9, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- In 2019, the American Cancer Society projected 1.76 million new cancer cases diagnosed and the number of deaths to stand at 606,880 in the U.S. Overall, the alarming projection has caused concern within the biotechnology marketspace. In response, biotechnology companies, specifically companies dabbling in the immunotherapy and oncology sector, are working to develop innovative treatments and therapies in order to effectively treat patients diagnosed with cancer. Mainly, most patients suffer from lung, breast, and prostate cancer, and in 2019, the National Cancer Institute expects 268,000 new breast cancer cases, 228,150 new lung cancer cases, as well as 174,650 new prostate cancer cases. Overall, several new cancer treatments such as immunomodulators, CAR-T cell therapy, and monoclonal antibodies are also becoming more abundant as biotechnology companies further develop and market these therapies. Compared to traditional treatments, these therapies are more technologically advanced, meaning they are more effective at suppressing or possibly even eliminating cancer. However, despite the progress in technology, the demand for cancer therapies isn't slowing down. Patients and medical institutes are constantly looking for more effective and efficient treatments in order to reduce the number of cases. And according to data compiled by Grand View Research, the global cancer immunotherapy market size is expected to reach USD 126.9 Billion by 2026 while exhibiting a CAGR of 9.6%. Additionally, the industry is expected to grow due to the increasing patient pools and higher mortality rates, while an increasing number of approvals for new immunotherapeutic drugs is also expected to propel the market. Oncology Pharma Inc. (OTC:ONPH), ENTITY, Inc. (NYSE:KDMN), Advaxis, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADXS), SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLS), Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN)\n\nThere is an ongoing shift from traditional chemotherapies to immunotherapies, which also has an impact on the market by further propelling its growth. In addition to early detection and treatment of cancer, the immuno-oncology industry is also developing post-treatment therapies to better protect patients from recurrence. There has also been an introduction of immunomodulatory drugs such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide, which were among the best treatment options in the past few years. As well as an influx of newer drug classes like antibodies and HDAC inhibitors which are designed to target specific cancers. \Faced with growing clinical workloads and decreasing margins, oncologists are under a growing amount of pressure at work,\"" said Joe DePinto, President of Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions. \""But, as our research shows, many oncologists are meeting their challenges head-on by proactively investing in tools, technology and additional clinical support staff. And today they are feeling more confident in their ability to adapt to changing trends, such as value-based care.\""\n\nOncology Pharma Inc. (OTC:ONPH) announced yesterday that, \""Stefan Gruenwald (MD, PhD), cofounder and president of Diagnomics Inc., has been elected to Oncology Pharma's supervisory board of directors.

He is the co-founder and managing partner of Genautica, established in December of 2010. Genautica is a California LLC located in close proximity to the Biotech Hub of San Diego.\n\nDr. Stefan Gruenwald, through Genautica, has seed-funded Diagnomics, a biotech company employing a highly qualified team of scientists, including early pioneers in sequencing the human genome. Through its investment in Diagnomics, Genautica has also been a co-founder and early investment partner of the EONE-Diagnomics Genome Center (EDGC) in Korea, which went public in 2018 on KOSDAQ, the major Korean tech stock market for over 400 Million USD. Part of the IPO proceeds have been used to buy a female health clinic (10,000 patients), build an R&D center in Songdo, Korea, housing 14 biotech and pharmaceutical companies, acquiring one of the major diagnostics distribution companies and expanding the clinical genome center approach to various countries in Asia. EDGC has grown rapidly and annual revenues for 2019 are predicted to be around 50 million USD.\n\nChuck Wagner, President of Oncology Pharma Inc., commented: \""Oncology Pharma conducted an exhaustive search to strengthen the board of directors' breadth of background and talent. I am delighted to have such an outstanding individual join the board to contribute to our mission, vision and goal of the company. Dr. Stefan Gruenwald is a pioneer with more than thirty years of experience in the biotechnology space and brings vast knowledge and experience in both the clinical, scientific and business fields to the company.\""\n\n\""I am very excited to join the Board of Directors of Oncology Pharma,\"" said Dr. Gruenwald. \""I've been involved in biotech for over a quarter of a century and I'm truly thrilled about this amazing opportunity to help this company to evolve into a world-wide leader in its space.\""\n\nABOUT ONCOLOGY PHARMA, INC: ONCOLOGY PHARMA, INC. (OTCPK: ONPH) (the \""Company\"") is a pioneering oncology company dedicated to developing, manufacturing, and commercializing therapeutics. The Company has licensed Tulynode's patent pending Autologous Immuno-therapy for durable therapy response using an extracorporeal device. The Company is currently engaging in research and development of therapeutics for oncology, and prides itself for having a world-class Advisory Board that keeps the Company in the forefront of developing technologies in cancer research, biotechnology, and healthcare.\""\n\nENTITY, Inc. (NYSE:KDMN) presented earlier last year preclinical data on KD033, its anti-PD-L1/IL-15 fusion protein in development for oncology indications, at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting, taking place November 7-11, 2018, in Washington, D.C. KD033 is a novel immunotherapy designed to stimulate an immune response directed to the tumor microenvironment. Recombinant IL-15 alone, which stimulates cancer-fighting immune effector cells, is not well tolerated when administered systemically. ENTITY has developed a novel approach to overcome this challenge by fusing IL-15 to an anti-PD-L1 antibody to direct IL-15 activity specifically to the tumor microenvironment, promoting efficacy and inducing durable responses while potentially increasing tolerability. \""Although immunotherapy has been game-changing for the treatment of cancer, many tumors learn to evade current therapies, limiting efficacy and durability of response. New approaches are needed to address relapsed or refractory patients as well as non-responders,\"" said Harlan W. Waksal, M.D., President and CEO at ENTITY. \""By directing a potent cancer-fighting response to the tumor site, KD033 has potential to safely overcome resistance and induce long-lasting responses for patients. We look forward to continuing our research on KD033 and initiating our first-in-patient studies in the second half of 2019.\""\n\nAdvaxis, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADXS) a late-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of immunotherapy products, announced recently updated data from the Phase 1/2 KEYNOTE-046 study in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This trial is being conducted in conjunction with Merck (known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada) and is evaluating ADXS-PSA, one of Advaxis' Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)-based immunotherapies, alone and in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy. Findings will be highlighted in a poster discussion entitled \""Effects of ADXS-PSA with or without Pembrolizumab on Survival and Antigen Spreading in Metastatic, Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients\"" at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting underway in Atlanta. The poster discussion will be held today from 1:00-5:00 p.m. ET and will be led by lead author Mark N. Stein M.D., FACS, Associate Professor of Medical Oncology at Columbia University Medical Center. \""We are very excited to report the updated ADXS-PSA data today at the AACR meeting,\"" said Kenneth A. Berlin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Advaxis. \""These data show the clinical potential of ADXS-PSA both alone and in combination with KEYTRUDA®. It is meaningful that the combination has been well-tolerated in the study population because dose-related toxicities can present challenges for cancer patients, and an additive therapy with a favorable safety and tolerability profile may offer an attractive option for clinicians if developed further in this indication.\"" He concluded, \""Based on the prolonged survival data and strong safety profile to date, we believe that continued clinical development of ADXS-PSA in combination with KEYTRUDA® is warranted and represents a potentially significant opportunity for Advaxis.\""\n\nSELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLS) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on novel cancer immunotherapeutics for a broad range of cancer indications. SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc. recently announced the dosing of the first patient in its Phase 1/2 open-label study of GPS in combination with Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), in patients with selected WT1-positive advanced cancers, including both solid tumors and hematologic malignances. \""This is an important milestone as this study allows us to potentially enhance our safety and activity profile of GPS in combination with anti-PD-1 therapies, particularly in combination with KEYTRUDA® in multiple malignances, following intriguing initial combination clinical data with OPDIVO®,\"" said Angelos M. Stergiou, M.D., ScD h.c., President and Chief Executive Officer of SELLAS. \""We are confident this study will build on our body of clinical evidence in support of the use of GPS in combination with PD-1 inhibitors to benefit cancer patients with limited treatment options. We believe that our innovative WT1 immunotherapeutic, GPS, in combination with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy agents, may provide therapeutic benefit for patients with WT1 expression. These beliefs are shared by the renowned U.S. oncologists who are undertaking this work. We look forward to studying this combination in patients with a wide range of cancers and expect to provide the first clinical data from this study in the first quarter of 2020.\""\n\nGeron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN) is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and potential commercialization of a first-in-class telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, in hematologic myeloid malignancies. Geron Corporation recently announced the opening of patient screening and enrollment for the Phase 3 portion of IMerge to evaluate imetelstat, a first-in-class telomerase inhibitor, in lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). IMerge is a two-part Phase 2/3 clinical trial of imetelstat in transfusion dependent patients with lower risk MDS who are relapsed after or refractory to erythroid stimulating agents (ESAs). The Phase 3 portion is planned to enroll approximately 170 patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the hypothesis that imetelstat improves the rate of red blood cell transfusion independence (TI). The trial is planned to be conducted at multiple medical centers globally, including North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. The primary efficacy endpoint is 8-week TI rate, which is defined as the proportion of patients achieving transfusion independence during any consecutive eight weeks since entry into the trial. Key secondary endpoints include the rate of transfusion independence lasting at least 24 weeks, or 24-week TI rate, durability of transfusion independence and the amount and relative change in transfusions. \""The start of the Phase 3 portion of IMerge is a significant milestone for Geron and imetelstat,\"" said John A. Scarlett, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \""We are hopeful that the Phase 3 will confirm the encouraging results from the Phase 2 portion, and that imetelstat could become a much-needed treatment alternative for patients with lower risk MDS.\""\n\nPlease Note: FinancialBuzz.com is not a financial advisory or advisor, investment advisor or broker-dealer and do not undertake any activities that would require such registration.

COUNTY SOVEREIGNTY COMMITTEE,0,"An addendum to the Building Bridges Initiative task force report last Wednesday leaves President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga with the discretion of deciding whether the country should go for a referendum to change the Constitution or not.\n\nThis comes in the wake of strong indications that the team has recommended alterations to the Executive to accommodate more players after the next elections, reintroducing the premiership, among other far-reaching changes.\n\nMultiple sources at the final meeting on October 23, the same day the term of the team expired, told us there was no consensus on the question of a referendum, the only motion that ended in a deadlock.\n\nCHANGES\n\nThose opposed to it, they said, held that any other changes in law needed to give the report life should be through Parliament.\n\nThe Sunday Nation learnt that Mr Odinga on Saturday retreated for a meeting with his trusted allies at the Coast to prepare them on possible scenarios before the final handover.\n\nHosted by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, the meeting was also attended by Kilifi ENTITY boss Amason Kingi and Minority Whip Junet Mohamed.\n\nMr Odinga is said to have tasked them to begin marshalling support for the recommendations, some that could see governors who are serving their final terms in office find a new lease of life in the new structure of government.\n\nLater on, they attended the burial of Michael Ngumbao, the slain uncle of the newly-elected Ganda MCA Ruben Katana in Malindi.\n\nA confidante of President Kenyatta also hinted at a silent mobilisation that is underway to enhance the acceptability of the report in his Central Kenya bedrock.\n\nMr Kenyatta is said to have taken exception to the move by Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri to lead a host of Mount Kenya MPs on Thursday in a press conference at Parliament Buildings to spell out conditions that must be met for them to embrace the yet-to-be-released recommendations.\n\nINCLUSIVITY\n\n\We are concerned about the underrepresentation of our people at all levels compared to the population and the number of voters in the region.\n\nWhen we talk about inclusivity, it must be reflected even in representation in Parliament and other spheres.\n\nIf the BBI does not address the challenges of equalisation of the vote, under the universal suffrage principle of one-man-one-vote, then we will sit down and advise our electorate accordingly,\"" the leaders said in a statement read by the lawmaker for Ndaragwa, Mr Jeremiah Kioni.\n\nThe popularity of the referendum among the committee members somewhat diminished after acting Treasury CS Ukur Yattani met the BBI team at the Sagana State Lodge, Nyeri, in the company of other technocrats and reportedly told them that the economy was not in a position to cater for a referendum before the next polls.\n\nThere were strong signals that President Uhuru Kenyatta would receive the BBI report on Sunday ahead of his expected trip to Saudi Arabia on Monday.\n\nHe returned to the country last evening from Sochi, Russia, where President Vladimir Putin hosted African heads of state for a summit.\n\nA member of the committee told us that they had all been asked to 'hang around' just in case the much-awaited call from the State House comes through.\n\nFrom Saudi Arabia, President Kenyatta is listed among guests at the swearing-in ceremony of President Mokgweetsi Masisi of Botswana.\n\nDEMOCRACY\n\nWith battle lines drawn ahead of the team making the report public, Deputy President William Ruto yesterday denied that he was walking a tightrope, having in the past said he would not support any recommendations that would seek to expand the Executive arm of government.\n\n\""Dilemma? No way! Jubilee as a democratic party celebrates diversity of opinion free of hate and focused on transformation for all; for us big or small matters but ultimately as initiators of inclusive non-tribal political discourse we will stand behind our Party and Leader,\"" he said.\n\nThe DP is alive to the fact that a referendum would not only redraw the country's political landscape but may also tilt the scales to his disadvantage as opposed to the current arrangement where he is almost assured of succeeding President Kenyatta in 2022.\n\nWhile his boss insists that BBI report would be the antidote for the ills facing the country, Dr Ruto is of the view that the content of the report must be subjected to a public debate by Kenyans before it can be adopted or rejected.\n\nSCATHING ATTACK\n\nNarok North MP Moitalel ole Kenta thinks a section of the political class's scathing attack on the BBI, even before its contents become clear, reflects an all-out opposition by forces allied to Dr Ruto to anything that Mr Kenyatta and Mr Odinga stand for.\n\n\""It also reflects a certain level of entitlement of politicians from certain communities to the leadership of the country. It is as if without them being leaders, there will be no Kenya.\""\n\nArticle 255 of the Constitution stipulates that any proposed changes to the supreme law that would affect the supremacy of this Constitution, the territory of Kenya, the ENTITY of the people, the national values and principles of governance, must be subjected to a referendum.\n\nOther areas are the Bill of Rights; the term of office of the President; the independence of the Judiciary and the commissions and independent offices to which Chapter 15 applies and the functions of Parliament.\n\nThere have been serious doubts whether President Kenyatta would want to subject the country to a referendum, a divisive exercise at a time he is racing against time to firm up his legacy.\n\nPOLITICAL CEASEFIRE\n\nAlready, he has two years to implement his projects before the campaign proper sets in. DP Ruto's camp is happy to sell this narrative. Well aware that the bicameral legislature is Dr Ruto's playground, his allies are itching to have the two Houses consider the recommendations of the BBI team.\n\nSome of the President's men, however, say he has no qualms pursuing the referendum route should it be contained in the report.\n\nA product of political ceasefire between Mr Kenyatta and Mr Odinga, the BBI team was formed after the March 9 handshake and mandated to come up with a solution to nine agendas, namely ethnic antagonism, lack of a national ethos, how to foster inclusivity, strengthening devolution and curing divisive elections.\n\nThe report is expected to cover aspects of safety and security, eradicating runaway corruption, enabling shared prosperity and entrenching rights and responsibilities.\n\nOn Saturday, task force chairman Yusuf Haji reiterated that the document was done."
COUNTY SOVEREIGNTY COMMITTEE,0,"With the UN now acting as if America must submit to its whims and decrees, it is more important than ever to understand how significant the implications of allowing this to continue would be. The whole notion that the UN was scheming to become a global government-style institution with centralized coercive powers was once dismissed as a \conspiracy theory\"" for \""kooks.\"" Today, it is obvious to anyone willing to pay attention to the news. As we reported in the companion article \""UN to America: We're the Boss,\"" the UN now regularly makes demands on America that fly in the face of traditional Americanism, across a broad range of crucial policy fields. And if left unchecked, this is only the start.\n\nUltimately, liberty, self-government, nation-states, and God-given rights will give way to total government if this is not stopped. And this is plain to see from the UN's own documents, statements, and agreements. Liberty is literally on the line, with globalists and the Deep State seeking to replace it with a fraud that sounds similar, at least at the most superficial level, but could not be more different in reality.\n\nAt the core of the UN's ongoing attacks against America is the drive to replace self-government under God and the God-given rights enshrined in America's founding documents with \""global governance\"" and UN-granted revocable privileges described by the UN as \""human rights.\"" And it is not exactly a secret. In fact, as The New American has documented extensively over a period of many years, the UN now brazenly and routinely claims that Americans' inalienable rights are actually violations of \""international human rights law,\"" and as such, must be drastically curtailed to comply with UN demands.\n\nIndeed, in the January 6, 2015 article headlined \""United Nations Exploits Pseudo-'Human Rights' to Attack U.S.,\"" The New American magazine documented this clearly with an array of examples. Among other concerns, the article gave multiple examples of the UN and its top officials publicly claiming that \""human rights\"" and \""international law\"" require that governments outlaw and punish certain speech, impose more gun control, ignore due-process protections, overturn state self-defense laws, eliminate constitutional limitations on federal power, prohibit spanking of children as a disciplinary tool, fund abortion with tax money, regulate private schools to comply with UN demands, provide more welfare and subsidized housing, and much, much more.\n\nAttacks on Free Speech, First Amendment\n\nSince the days of the Soviet Union's push to ban \""hate speech\"" internationally, the UN has been waging war on free speech. The UN actually claims international human rights law now requires nations to ban all sorts of speech -- basically, anything the UN deems hate, intolerance, discrimination, and so on. In 2014, for instance, two separate UN outfits, the dictator-dominated UN Human Rights Commission and the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, slammed Japan for not violating the free speech protections in its Constitution to ban speech, rallies, and groups that the UN considers \""hateful.\"" Even \""propaganda\"" that might \""incite discrimination or hostility\"" must be banned, the UN demanded of Japan, specifically targeting groups and rallies perceived as being \""Anti-Korean.\""\n\nThen UN Human Rights Czar Navi Pillay, a South African who condemned the United States after the killing of Trayvon Martin, offered some chilling insight into the dictator-dominated global body's views on the fundamental right to free speech. \""Defining the line that separates protected from unprotected speech is ultimately a decision that is best made after a thorough assessment of the circumstances of each case,\"" she argued. In other words, every time somebody speaks, they run the risk of violating the UN-backed restrictions on free speech. And in many nations, such outlandish international schemes are being cited as justification for jailing -- yes, jailing -- pastors, critics of Islam, critics of homosexuality, critics of mass migration, supporters of marriage, those who disagree with escalating gender confusion, and more.\n\nAfter the rally in Charlottesville over monuments that turned bloody, the UN openly called for free speech rights to be curtailed in America. In official statements, the UN said the U.S. government must \""provide the necessary guarantees so that such rights [free speech] are not misused to promote racist hate speech.\"" First, it will be \""racist hate speech.\"" Then, anything the UN and its member governments hate will be banned as \""hate speech,\"" as has occurred in so many nations. The UN also called on the U.S. government to wage a propaganda campaign that would \""actively contribute to the promotion of understanding, tolerance, and diversity between ethnic groups, and acknowledge their contribution to the history and diversity of the United States of America.\"" In other words, ban speech the UN dislikes, and use tax money to spread the UN's ideas.\n\nAttacks on Gun Rights, Second Amendment\n\nIt is not just free speech and freedom of the press that are in the UN's crosshairs. Gun rights are under threat, too. In 2016, after a jihadist with widely reported homosexual proclivities shot up a homosexual bar in Florida, the UN immediately interjected itself. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Hussein, an Islamic prince, claimed the U.S. government has an \""obligation\"" to implement \""robust gun regulation.\"" \""It is hard to find a rational justification that explains the ease with which people can buy firearms,\"" Hussein said, claiming that \""evidence\"" shows firearms make society less safe and that the U.S. government must intervene.\n\nTwo years earlier, a UN report on supposed human-rights abuses in America claimed the U.S. government must adopt more gun-control legislation, including gun registration, and remove self-defense rights. Countless similar statements and reports have been disgorged by the UN in recent years. In 2013, for example, the UN released a statement by \""experts\"" claiming the Obama administration was \""required\"" to \""amend, rescind, or nullify any laws or regulations which have the effect of creating or perpetuating racial discrimination.\"" Specifically, the UN was demanding an end to \""stand your ground\"" self-defense laws in Florida and other states, along with other laws protecting fundamental rights.\n\nAnd of course, as readers of this magazine know well, the global body has been working hard to force all nations to adopt draconian gun control through the UN Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). Among other claims, the treaty purports to grant a monopoly over weaponry to \""authorized state parties,\"" in other words to governments, ignoring the dangers signaled via the 300 million murders perpetrated by governments in the last century alone. Ammunition falls under the treaty's prohibitions, too. And in Article 5, the UN agreement commits all national governments to \""establish and maintain a national control system, including a national control list,\"" over \""the broadest range of conventional arms.\"" That means all of your guns are in the crosshairs.\n\nIt is hardly a pipe dream. In Venezuela, the UN helped socialist tyrant Hugo Chávez disarm civilians as part of a 2012 disarmament campaign that banned all private firearms. Speaking to regime-run \""reporters,\"" UN Coordinator for Venezuela Alfredo Missair urged them to actively support the gun ban. \""You are also responsible in this important fight -- we need the cooperation of not only the United Nations but of the media,\"" Missair said. \""So, we are offering all the support they require to do a good job.\"" Murder and crime rates promptly soared as the newly empowered regime stepped up its persecution of the opposition. Today, Venezuela has among the worst crime rates and the worst tyranny of any country on Earth.\n\nYet despite all that, the UN has plenty of friends in America who would love to see the same exact thing. In late 2017, Cook ENTITY Commissioner Richard Boykin went to New York City and asked the UN to send peacekeeping troops into Chicago to help deal with gun crime. \""I'm hoping to appeal to the UN to actually come to Chicago and meet with victims of violence, and maybe even possibly help out in terms of peacekeeping efforts, because I think it's so critical for us to make sure that these neighborhoods are safe,\"" Boykin was quoted as telling the press, claiming there was a \""genocide\"" going on against black Americans because most victims of shootings were black. \""So we must protect these population groups, and that's what the United Nations does. They're a peacekeeping force. They know all about keeping the peace, and so we're hopeful that they'll hear our appeal.\""\n\nAside from attacks on speech and gun rights, the UN also routinely denigrates America's federalist system of government. In direct violation of the 10th Amendment, which states that any powers not specifically given to the U.S. government remain the province of state governments or the people themselves, the UN has long been demanding that the U.S. government usurp all sorts of powers that were never delegated to it in order to comply with UN demands. It has also repeatedly derided the American justice system with its due process protections, presumption of innocence, trial by jury, and more. This was perhaps most extreme in the wake of the Trayvon Martin shooting, but continues to this day. Under the guise of fighting \""terrorism\"" and \""crime\"" and other issues, the UN now routinely demands all sorts of abuses of privacy, too, including global biometric databases, national biometric IDs, support from Big Tech to censor and spy on citizens, and much more.\n\nIn short, there are no fundamental rights enjoyed by Americans that the UN does not seek to eliminate.\n\nUN's \""Human Rights\"": Homosexual \""Marriage,\"" Government Control\n\nBy contrast, the UN celebrated the Supreme Court's usurpation of power to invent a right to a \""homosexual marriage\"" as a great leap forward in human rights. \""I whole-heartedly welcome this historic decision,\"" then-UN boss Ban said in San Francisco about Obergefell while commemorating the 70th anniversary of the signing of the UN Charter. \""This is a great step forward for human rights in the United States.\"" In a speech given that same day at a lunch for the UN pro-homosexuality and -transgender campaign \""free and equal,\"" Ban celebrated June 26 as \""a day we celebrate not only the birth of the United Nations but marriage equality for all Americans.\""\n\nThe UN's legions of discredited \""special rapporteurs,\"" meanwhile, have long made clear that they view \""rights\"" in the same way the regimes enslaving the people of the Soviet Union, Cuba, Vietnam, China, and other communist nations have viewed rights. In the United Kingdom, for example, a UN special rapporteur infamous for sacrificing an animal to Karl Marx was relentlessly ridiculed for accusing the U.K. government of \""human rights violations\"" because welfare recipients were not being given large enough houses. In Switzerland, UN bureaucrats attacked stay-at-home mothers as human-rights violators. In Canada, they claimed supposedly \""low\"" taxes were a \""human rights\"" violation because the government needed more resources to battle everything from obesity to inequality.\n\nThere is a method to the madness (See sidebar on page 36). The UN's vision of human rights for the world is exactly the opposite of the views held by America's Founding Fathers that produced the greatest and freest nation in history -- not to mention the moral code outlined in the Bible that is at the core of Western civilization. As explained in the Declaration of Independence, the Founders said it was self-evident that God had created people and endowed them with unalienable rights such as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They also said governments exist to protect those unalienable rights. The Founders literally viewed rights as a sacred gift from God, as they explained repeatedly.\n\nThe UN, by contrast, believes that governments and international agreements confer privileges that can be revoked at any time for little to no cause. In Article 29 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for instance, the document makes clear that rights can be limited by law under virtually any pretext. It also says that the alleged rights may \""in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\"" In other words, individuals have no unalienable rights under the UN's view of human rights, only privileges that can be revoked at will by governments and international organizations.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Council, meanwhile, is literally dominated by dictatorships, with unfree regimes holding the majority of seats. The predecessor organ-ization, the UN Human Rights Committee, was once led by the late Libyan tyrant Moammar Gadhafi. And current UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet is a known supporter of socialism and even mass-murdering communist dictatorships such as the Castro regime enslaving Cuba. In her younger years, as victims were being slaughtered trying to flee East Germany, she defected to that mass-murdering communist regime. She recently praised the \""squad\"" of fringe left-wing congresswomen (AOC et al.) famous for hating America and Trump. \""I believe that those four women are fantastic,\"" she said, describing them as \""bright\"" and celebrating their alleged courage \""to say what they think\"" about supposed U.S. deficiencies.\n\nNor does the UN itself respect even the most fundamental rights of people. According to the organization Hear Their Cries, UN troops and international aid workers and bureaucrats have raped and sexually exploited over 60,000 women and children just in the last decade. A poll conducted by the non-profit Save the Children revealed that just in the Ivorian town of Toulepleu, which was occupied by UN peace troops, eight out of 10 minor girls admitted to regularly being raped and forced into sexual acts by UN soldiers. Unspeakable horrors perpetrated by the UN's \""blue helmets\"" have been documented from Africa and Asia to Europe and the Americas and everywhere in between. And yet, because of \""diplomatic immunity,\"" there has been virtually no accountability at all.\n\nThe hypocrisy of the UN's supposed quest for human rights in America is perhaps most perfectly illustrated in its hypocrisy over Communist China. While the United States is constantly under fire, the regime in Beijing does not just get a pass -- top UN officials bend over backward to protect the mass-murdering dictatorship from criticism. Consider the recent case at the UN Human Rights Council, where a coalition of more than 120 organizations sought to file a formal complaint against Beijing's network of \""re-education\"" camps holding well over a million Uighur Muslims, but was prevented from even publishing a formal complaint at the UN Human Rights Council, in violation of its own procedures. Before that, a top UN \""human rights\"" official was exposed by a whistleblower handing straight to Beijing the names of Chinese dissidents seeking to testify against the regime. The whistleblower was persecuted, while the highest echelons of the UN worked to cover up the whole matter by firing judges and suppressing the facts.\n\nUN Seeking to Become Global Government\n\nUltimately, the globalist goal is to turn the UN into a global government that would actively deny individual rights -- one that could not be effectively resisted by its victims. It already has courts, armies, self-styled \""law enforcement\"" and \""crime fighting\"" divisions, and much more. Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon repeatedly referred to the UN as the \""Parliament of Humanity.\"" A parliament, by definition, is a law-making body of a government. Before that, Ban referred to the UN Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals -- essentially a roadmap to global technocratic government -- as the planetary \""declaration of interdependence.\"" The head of the UN General Assembly when the scheme was adopted, Peter Thompson, referred to it as a \""master-plan for humanity.\""\n\nThis has been the objective from the start, when U.S. diplomat (and Soviet agent) Alger Hiss led the conference to create the UN. Among those involved in the process who have admitted the goal was John Foster Dulles, a leading Deep State globalist who also helped create the UN and went on to become U.S. secretary of state. \""The United Nations represents not a final stage in the development of world order, but only a primitive stage,\"" he wrote in his book War or Peace. \""Therefore its primary task is to create the conditions which will make possible a more highly developed organization.\"" Dulles also observed in his book, \""I have never seen any proposal made for collective security with 'teeth' in it, or for 'world government' or for 'world federation,' which could not be carried out either by the United Nations or under the United Nations Charter.\""\n\nUnder President Trump, there have been some efforts to rein in the UN, including leaving some UN agencies. There have also been some tepid efforts to reverse the perverted UN view of human rights. This summer, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo created a commission to deal with the corruption of discourse about human rights. Dubbed the \""Commission on Unalienable Rights,\"" the body was tasked with recommending \""reforms of human rights discourse where it has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights.\"" It was a nice thought. But the commission was endlessly demonized and mocked by glob-alists and totalitarians, and it is not clear that it will accomplish much, if anything.\n\nThe real solution to the UN's escalating attacks on American ENTITY and liberty must involve getting out of the UN, something The John Birch Society, which publishes this magazine, has been advocating for over 50 years. Legislation to do that is in Congress already. One of the sponsors of the American ENTITY Restoration Act (HR 204), Representative Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), has been a leader in the campaign for an #Amexit from the UN. He told The New American in an interview last year that there are many reasons why the U.S. government should get out of the globalist institution.\n\n\""The best thing that you can say about the United Nations is it's mostly ineffective and a waste of money,\"" said Congressman Massie, who started campaigning for an \""Amexit\"" from the UN after the British people voted for a \""Brexit\"" from the European Union. \""That's the best thing you can say about it. So I'm glad that they are somewhat ineffective, but I don't like that we waste the money.\"" But that is just the start. \""It's full of dictators, and it's also something that I don't think our sovereign government should defer to,\"" he explained. \""For instance, a lot of these foreign relations bills that come in front of us in Congress and the whereas clauses -- they might say 'whereas the UN has said this,' or 'the UN decided this, now therefore be it resolved' -- well that's almost an automatic no for me, because why would I defer to the United Nations if we're a sovereign country?\""\n\nMassie also noted that many of his colleagues love the UN and would like to see the United States even more deeply ensnared within its grasp. And therein lies the problem. These members of Congress were elected by ignorant Americans who do not understand their own heritage, their freedoms, or the existential threat posed to them by the dictators club. As such, beyond simply ending U.S. membership in the UN, Americans must educate the electorate. Absolutely essential to that mission will be restoring a proper public understanding on the nature of rights, the role of government, the U.S. Constitution, and the danger of phony ideas on \""human rights\"" that require the government to redistribute wealth extracted from others by force. Without that understanding, even an #Amexit would be only a temporary solution. By getting involved in the JBS campaign to \""Get U.S. Out of the United Nations,\"" you can join with others and turn the tide today.\n\nPhoto credit: AP Images"

KARNES,0,"While HBO is credited with groundbreaking programming that changed television, it's easy to forget that FX was there, too. It's still changing television with shows like Atlanta, Pose, American Crime Story and Fosse/Verdon.\n\nBut when FX launched in 1994, it was the scrappy sister to the premium companies. That was back when all anyone knew about the channel was its tagline. Its first three series efforts -- none of which you remember -- were canceled within the year. But in 2002, FX hit its stride and began producing series that would become among the last of appointment TV before DVRs and Netflix.\n\nSo put down that Roku remote and recall some of the original FX shows that helped change off-network television.\n\nThe Shield\n\nAs an actor, Michael Chiklis doesn't get enough credit from going from the lovable Tony Scali in ABC's The Commish to Vic Mackey, who would have probably killed Scali and framed someone else for it. The Shield centered around Mackey: a cop and the leader of the Strike Team, a good cop (in the sense that he got results) and a bad cop in essentially every other way. You need a confession out of an accused child molester? Give Mackey five minutes and a telephone book.\n\nAs much as network television pushed the envelope with police dramas, The Shield started out with a bang and kept the momentum going. In the first episode, one of the Strike Team members is shot and killed by Vic Mackey himself, so it set the pace for future off-network dramas. Anything -- and anyone -- could go. Mackey and the team are set upon throughout the series by criminals, other officers and, finally, themselves.\n\nBy the show's conclusion, it had drawn the likes of Glenn Close (remember that name) and Forest Whitaker as guest stars. The supporting cast was pretty good, too: CCH Pounder's Claudette Wyms was the Strike Team foil for all seven seasons, and then there was Dutch Wagenbach (played by Jay ENTITY), who may or may not have been very close to pursuing a life as a killer.\n\nNip/Tuck\n\nTwo friends open a plastic surgery practice together.

The other is a family man whose son looks nothing like him -- but does have the features of his best friend and business partner.\n\nThat sounds like a basic premise, but it turned out that Nip/Tuck, the first vehicle done for FX by Ryan Murphy (who is now a writer for Pose), relied heavily on shock value. And it worked. There were the realistic-looking surgery scenes, the sex scenes, the guest stars (among them the late Joan Rivers, playing herself, as a patient who wanted the main characters to undo all the plastic surgery she'd had) and the plot lines, which were, in a word, wild. There were serial killers, and there were love triangles that became love octagons.\n\nNip/Tuck got a lot of attention from a storyline featuring one of the first transgender characters. Unfortunately, Famke Janssen's Ava Moore was also a baby abductor and definitely a child molester.\n\nDamages\n\nThis series put Rose Byrne on the map, and because of this show, it can still be a little unbelievable to watch her in rom-coms. In Damages, Byrne was cast opposite Glenn Close, and they spent the entire series trying to basically kill each other.\n\nClose was Patty Hewes, a lawyer who would do anything to win a case, and Byrne was Ellen Parsons, who was handpicked by Hewes as the newest addition to her firm. It doesn't take long to figure out why, which marked the beginning of the cat-and-mouse game Patty and Ellen would play for the next five seasons.\n\nEach season focused on a high-profile case that often featured stories stolen from recent headlines. There was also a deep roster of guest stars, including Ted Danson, Martin Short, William Hurt, Chris Messina and John Goodman. Close, Byrne and the show racked up awards in response to the strong showing.\n\nOf course, there were previous legal dramas that showed lawyers as unscrupulous puppeteers, but this was way beyond L.A. law. Patty resorted to means that seemed as if it would often be easier to just try the case, but why argue when you can watch Close and Byrne outfox each other instead?\n\nNafari VanaskiNafari Vanaski is a freelance writer for Adweek."
ABDELMALEK,1,"Commentary by Arezki Daoud: Algeria has been plagued by widespread corruption ever since Bouteflika became president in 1999. All the men and women he hired essentially set out to restructure the legal system to protect their interests, and created bureaucratic practices that enabled them to institutionalize corruption in unprecedented ways never seen anywhere else in the world.\n\nThe scale of corruption in Algeria was (is) such that it is almost impossible to find an official that has been in office from 1999 to 2019 who has clean hands. So much so that while the 1990s are dubbed \the dark decade\"" due to the civil war that claimed tens of thousands of lives, the Bouteflika reign should be dubbed \""the two decades of deep corruption.\"" Corruption practices used over the past 20 years include the classic and disgusting practice of demanding a commission on projects, imposing an equity partner on a business created by either another Algerian national or a foreign company, all the way to confiscating the lands and properties legitimately owned by individuals and families for the pleasure of the corrupt official.\n\nCorruption has been widespread, not just at the very top level, with ministers and state-own company CEOs milking the system, but smaller-scaled corruption was the de-facto culture in provincial (Wali) and local governments. Anyone with power, at any level, had to engage in extortion and other acts deemed criminal in normal societies. If you needed a simple birth certificate, you were at the mercy of a tiny clerk, demand bribes. This was the norm in Algeria. It was instituted by the Bouteflika clan, defended by Grand Viziers like Prime Ministers Ahmed Ouyahia and ENTITY, and practiced by everyone so as to divvy up the oil revenue. As for those small bribes in city halls, they were meant to keep the little people busy. Normal governance and management were non existent and that's why Algeria is where it is today, in a deep political crisis.\n\nThe current crisis and one of the main reasons why Algerian leaders are not willing to move to the next step is largely due to the fact that many of the men who form the Military Command in charge of the country today, are also deeply corrupt. They cannot fathom or accept the idea of letting it go altogether, or face the same predicament as those who are now behind bars. Algerian generals have long ruled like emperors in their fiefdoms. The country is divided into several so-called military regions, with each region having its general in charge of security. These men reported to no-one, as if they were warlords. They have always been and still are above and beyond the law. And, as part of the culture, nothing happens in their regions without their consent, and often that means commission payments, gifts, and so many other way to enrich themselves. In addition to the region's chiefs there are the commanders who oversee the various branches of the military, from the army to air force, and from the navy to intelligence, give or take 24 of them in today's Command who are frightened by what may happen to them should the rule of law prevail.\n\nThese men are powerful, unwilling to compromise, and without a reasonable strategy to save the republic. They still think that they invulnerable and untouchable, just like the mighty previous Ministers of Oil thought of themselves. Just like the Prime Ministers in prison, one of these oil ministers has been sent to the notorious Harrach prison over this past weekend. Not too long ago, Youcef Yousfi was the king of the industrial sector in Algeria, more powerful than his bosses, wining and dining with the most powerful global corporations, hedge fund managers, leaders of the IMF and World Bank, and government officials around the world. That myth of the all-powerful minister is over. Yousfi is alleged by Algerian prosecutors to have squandered public funds. But Algerians are waiting for another notorious figure of the Bouteflika reign, the president's very own friend Chakib Khelil, ex-oil Minister who has been accused by both Algerian and European courts of corruption. While he was once favored to replace President Bouteflika, Khelil is not in Algeria, having fled, fearing justice. It is unclear whether he is a US citizen or a green card holder, but he is likely in the Gulf, a region that has no problem sponsoring dictators and thugs from Idi Amin Dada to Zine el-Abidin Ben Ali. They used them well. If he is a US citizen, then he may even be in breach of US law banning US citizens from serving another government and he will have to face the US Justice Department on this.\n\nIn addition to demanding that the likes of Khelil return home to face justice, Algerians will be expecting from the judiciary to reactivate the cases involving the misdeeds and illegal activities of the many foreign companies that have help perpetuate the state of chaos in Algeria. Canada's SNC Lavalin and many Italian firms have been named in court cases in Algeria, Italy and elsewhere and have yet to face their accusers in an Algerian court. But that day will only come after the military command surrenders power to a civilian government.\n\nAlgiers, July 14, 2019 (AFP) - Algeria's former industry minister was placed in provisional detention Sunday on allegations of squandering public money, state television reported. Youcef Yousfi is the latest among a series of prominent politicians and businessmen to be detained or questioned in connection with corruption since longtime leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned in April in the face of mass protests against his rule.\n\nYousfi, who served between 2017 and 2019, is under investigation for graft and is suspected among other things of \""squandering public funds\"" as well as \""abuse of power and conflict of interest\"", the state broadcaster said. He was placed under preventive detention by the supreme court's investigating magistrate, it said."
ABDELMALEK,0,"The newly-appointed Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the Democratic People's Republic of Algeria Hossein Mashalchizadeh held a series of meetings with Algeria's high-ranked officials with a view to explore avenues for bolstering and reinvigorating all-out bilateral cooperation.\n\nThe Iranian Diplomat held a meeting with the Algerian Commerce Minister Said Djelab, during which both sides put forward the deep and solid friendship between the two brotherly countries, expressing the will of their countries to further work for their consolidation and strengthening, especially in the economic field in the best interests of both peoples.\n\nWelcoming the level of bilateral cooperation in the various spheres, both officials noted that this cooperation has initiated a new era given the deep links binding both countries, wishing its promotion at a higher level, through the conclusion of joint projects as well as the exchange of expertises and experiences as well as the participation of both countries' delegations at exhibitions promoting local products.\n\nIn the same vein, the Iranian Envoy met with the Minister of Communication, Government's Spokesman and Acting Minister of Culture, Hassan Rebahi.\n\nAfter highlighting the fraternal relations between Algeria and Iran, both sides called for the intensification of efforts to further promote cooperation at the highest level, in accordance with the will of the leaders of the two countries and on the basis of their converging positions on numbers of causes.\n\nWith respect to communication aspect, they welcomed the level of the cooperation binding both countries, highlighting the need to further expand media cooperation and the exchange of press technology and expertise between both countries given the great role assigned to news agencies in terms of helping to realize a better knowledge of others in order to overcome the great deficiency in Muslim world, especially nowadays when our world is facing biased media of the World Arrogance and need to make more efforts to introduce and prove righteousness of its positions.\n\nHighlighting the potentials and energies of these countries, they called to speed up the pace of exchange of delegations of journalists, adding that the exchange of information in both countries can provide fertile ground for the development of cultural and diplomatic ties as well as scientific, economic, commercial and cultural cooperation, which is supported by the existence of common will among the leaders of the two countries. The spotlight was placed also on the need to ink MoUs between both countries' news agencies.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that National news agency Algeria Press Service (APS) and Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) signed, in 2018, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on news exchange.\n\nThe Memorandum of Understanding was signed by \APS\"" Director General, Abdelhamid Kacha, and IRNA Agency Director General, Seyed Zia Hachémi.\n\nDuring the signing ceremony, both parties agreed to exchange information services (information, photos, videos and computer graphics) as well as to carry out joint projects, affirming that grounds for expansion of professional cooperation between the two news agencies are well prepared.\n\nBefore the signing ceremony, IRNA agency Director General paid a visit to the various departments of the APS, where he received explanations on the activities of the Agency and the processing of information, meanwhile, MR. Hashemi expressed his admiration for the \""organization\"" of these services.\n\nOn the other hand, Algerian delegations frequently pay visits to Iran with a view to usher in good cooperation between the two media for strengthening and expanding Iran-Algeria relations.\n\nThe opening of IRNA bureau in Algeria was, repeatedly, arisen by Algerian visiting delegations. Director General of the Algerian news agency APS Abdelhamid Kacha, Managing Director of 'Al-Khabar\"" newspaper Kamal Jouzi and Managing Director of \""Al-Khabar \""TV network Ali Jari, stressed, in different visits, that the opening of IRNA news bureau in Algiers and the exchange of reporters and media persons will help broaden cultural affinities between the two sides.\n\nAs long as culture is concerned, the Iranian Diplomat and the Algerian Acting Culture Minister hailed the cultural cooperation exiting between both countries, calling for its broadening into other fields such as; theater, music and literature.\n\nA movie on Ahmed Bey (c. 1784-1850), the last Ottoman ruler of Algiers is co-produced by Algeria and Iran. Iranian filmmaker Jamal Shurjeh is the film's director and the costumes and film sets have been designed by Iranian experts. The Iranian cineaste Danesh Eqbashavi, is, also, collaborating on the film, directing the war scenes for \""Ahmed Bey\"". An Iranian team will give consultation on the stunt, make-up, shooting and sound-on-film.\n\nThe film, depicting Ahmed Bey's life from 1826 to 1848 when he ruled the Regency of Algiers, laid grounds for more cooperation between Tehran and Algiers in various fields related to cinema and arts.\n\nThis experience is highly appreciated by the Algerian side, as expressed by the former Culture Minister Azzedine Mihoubi, who considered this joint project of film-making with Iran as an opportunity for getting familiar with the Iranian cinema style as well as exchanging cultural knowledge between the two countries.\n\nAlgeria, for its part, is eager to introduce Algerian culture and art to Iranian people, participating in different exhibitions, lastly few months ago, an Algerian Cultural Exhibition was held at Melal Cultural Center, with a view to make people of the two countries more familiar with each other's cultures, customs and traditions. Works of visual and traditional arts (Watercolor, oil paint, acrylic painting, miniature, painting on sand, ceramic panels, etc.) and handicraft were displayed, illustrating to Iranians the historical aspects and life of the people of Algeria.\n\nOn the other hand, different Iranian cultural exhibitions took place in Algeria to get the Algerians familiar with Iran's culture and art.\n\nSeveral major cultural and art fairs are frequently organized by Iran's embassy in Algeria, such as: the one held last year in Blida province, located about 45 km south-west of Algiers, and 10th Intl. Festival of Calligraphy, Miniatures Exhibition with prominent Iranian artists in attendance, where they were warmly honored.\n\nScreening Iranian films and documentaries, holding calligraphy workshops, performing Iranian music, introducing Iranian food and confectionery, introducing Iranian science, tourism and historical attractions and displaying films are always on the agendas of the exhibitions' programs, international book fairs and cultural weeks which help the two nations get more acquainted with the cultural identity and tradition of one another.\n\nLast May, Algerians discovered for a week the Iranian movies following a government initiative to diversify cinematographic products. An Iranian Film Week was held in Algeria in order to present Persian culture and cinema to the African country's public.\n\nProminent Iranian film directors, namely; Seyyed Reza Mirkarimi and Kamal Tabrizi attended the event where a number of Iranian films were screened; such as; A Cube of Sugar by Reza Mirkarimi, About Eli by Asghar Farhadi, A Piece of Bread by Kamal Tabrizi and Mainline by Rakhshan Bani-Etemad. Different cultural panels about Iranian cinema were also held on the sidelines of the event with Algerian directors and producers.\n\nThe Iranian Ambassador was received, also, by the Minister of Relations with Parliament Fathi Khouil. During their meeting, both sides emphasized the need to boost parliamentary cooperation through the exchange of delegations and the activation of Algeria-Iran parliamentary friendship group, reiterating that parliamentary diplomacy can help reinforcing peace and stability and fostering talks to remove tensions and settle the regional crises.\n\nOn January 10, 2019, Algeria-Iran parliamentary friendship group was set up at the headquarters of Algeria's People's National Assembly ( Parliament's Lower House) in Algiers with a view to consolidate and strengthen parliamentary relations in accordance with the provisions of a framework for joint activities, especially in the parliamentary arena.\n\nFor his part, Algerian Religious Affairs and Endowment Minister Youssef Belmahdi granted the Iranian Diplomat a meeting, during which both sides hailed the brotherly relations between the two Muslim countries, underlining the necessity of strengthening them in various fields.\n\nThe religious cooperation and exchange between both countries is experiencing a glare with meetings between religious scholars from Algeria and Iran taking place frequently. Earlier, an agreement was inked, in Algiers, between the President of High Islamic Council, Bouabdellah Ghlamallah, and Iran's Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, Reza Salehi Amiri, which aimed at finding means of preventing and fighting Takfiri and extremist groups, as well as rescuing the Islamic world from the crisis being experienced.\n\nIn addition, Algeria expresses admiration for Tehran's International Holy Quran Exhibition held each year, describing it as a big, major religious display in the global arena that has contributed to Muslims solidarity.\n\n'The Zionist regime's plots against the Muslim world have caused division among the Muslim countries; however, the Islamic Republic of Iran has played a role in making the Muslim nations united by holding an international exhibition of Holy Quran,' Algerian Ambassador to Iran Abdel Moun'aam Ahriz told the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).\n\nBesides, hand-woven Persian carpets covering an area of 12,000 square meters are decorating the Grand Mosque of Algiers (world's third largest mosque, also known Djamaa El Djazair mosque, to be completed in Algeria).\n\nEarlier, Algeria's the then Minister of Religious Affairs and Endowments Mohamed Aissa said that his ministry received the first batch of the carpets, made up of 539 pieces at the end of 2014, in a contractual framework with the Waqfs or Endowments Foundation.\n\nAccording to IRNA news agency, the carpets were purchased by an Algerian businessman with a price tag of 6 million from Iranian cities of Naeen and Kashan with a view to add a unique touch to this tremendous cultural and architectural project.\n\nEarlier and following the handing of his credentials, His Excellency Hossein Mashalchizadeh held a meeting with the Algerian Head of State Abdelkader Bensalah, during which, he described relations binding Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Algeria as friendly, emphasizing the determination of the Islamic Republic for strengthening and expanding relations in various fields with Algiers.\n\nFor his part, Bensaleh conveyed his warmest greetings to his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhan, wishing evermore success for the ambassador in his new post in line with strengthening bilateral ties.\n\nThe Iranian Ambassador held another meeting with the foreign Minister Sabri Boukadoum, during which bilateral relations and means to further boost them in the best interests of the two brotherly countries and peoples have been reviewed. In addition, the latest developments in the region have been discussed.\n\nMashalchizadeh replaced Reza Ameri, former Iranian Ambassador to Algeria.\n\nIran and Algeria enjoy constructive relations with bilateral cooperation increasing since the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries in September 2000. Former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad expressed, in 2007, Iran's determination to remove all obstacles to developing economic ties between Iran and Algeria.\n\nOver 2008, bilateral trade between Algeria and Iran doubled from $25 million in 2007 to $50 million. In addition to bilateral trade in commercial good, Iran and Algeria have inked up to 70 agreements and MoUs in different fields, to wit, inter alia, energy, industry, banking, agricultural industries, mining, energy, justice, education, tourism, and art.. etc.\n\nIran and Algeria, respectively the world's second and seventh largest natural gas reserve holders also want to share expertise in various areas of gas including production, marketing and the liquefied natural gas (LNG) business.\n\nTalks were launched to buy Algeria's phosphate, a move welcomed by the Algerian side as the then Algerian Energy Minister Yousfi responded favorably, proposing that companies in both countries get together to discuss the details in order to reach agreements to facilitate the exporting of Algerian phosphate to Iran.\n\nIn July 2008, Iran and Algeria announced plans to build a joint cement plant in Algeria worth nearly $300 million, thus greatly increasing their industrial cooperation.\n\nWith respect to automotive industry, many agreements between the Algerian group Tahkout and Iranian car manufacturer Saipa for the establishment of a great complex, with an implementation cost amounts USD 300 to million, made up of fifteen factories in Tiaret, west of Algiers, were inked.\n\nThe Iranian party is contributing with its technological expertise in the manufacturing of cars running on CGN.\n\nAnother automotive industry agreement has been signed between private group Rahmouni and Khodro manufacturer for the assembling of cars in Algeria.\n\nBesides, Iran's major tire producer Yazd Tire concluded an export deal with Renault's Algerian operations to export 50,000 tires produced by the company in central Iran to Algeria.\n\nFurthermore and covering different fields, a draft agreement between Algeria's Geological Survey Agency and its Iranian counterpart was inked to establish a cooperation framework in the mining research.\n\nIn this regard, the Algerian standardization institute (IANOR) signed a draft agreement with its Iranian counterpart to ease trade exchange between Algeria and Iran while bringing closer both countries' standards.\n\nThe Algerian Company of Fairs and Exhibitions (Safex) and the Iranian Agency for Foreign Trade signed an agreement to facilitate Algeria's participation in Iranian exhibitions and shows, and vice-versa.\n\nA MoU on the production of drugs and medical equipment was signed by the then Director of Pharmacy and Medical Equipment at the ministry of Health, Population and the Hospital Reform Hamou Hafedh and Iran's Deputy-Minister and President of the Organization of Food and Drugs Rasoul Dinar Kand. It relates to the manufacturing of vaccines and serums in Algeria.\n\nAnother MoU was inked from the Algerian side by the then Director General of Frater-Razes Labs Abdelhamid Cherfaoui and from the Iranian side by Director of Baboush lab Darou Khir Abadi on the manufacturing of biotech drugs.\n\nIn 2017, eight cooperation deals, covering different fields, were inked during the Second Joint Iran-Algeria Economic Cooperation Commission presided by First Vice President Es'haq Jahangiri and Algerian Prime Minister ENTITY Salal with a number of the two countries' cabinets in attendance.\n\nThe first deal signed by the two sides pertains to education. Other documents included cooperation agreement between the two countries' youth and sports ministries during 2015-2017, technical collaboration deal between their labor ministries as well as cultural cooperation deal between the culture ministries.\n\nThe two countries' higher education and justice ministries also signed relevant deals.\n\nRelations between central banks of the two countries picked up in the recent years coinciding with the exchange between high-ranking banking officials from Iran and Algeria. At present, central banks of the two countries are interrelated and obstacles related to issuing purchase and sale contracts have been removed through serious follow-ups.\n\nAs regards tourism; some Iranian travel agencies are in touch with their Algerian counterparts with a view to boost tourism cooperation for the acquaintance of the two nations with each other's history and civilization.\n\nPolitically, Iran and Algeria hold regular talks on bilateral, regional and international issues. Regular meetings between the two foreign ministries' officials, high-ranked delegations within the framework of relations and regular consultations are taking place. Their brotherly relations are deeply rooted and go back to the 1960s. Soon after Algeria's independence from France in 1962, Iran was among the first countries to recognize it as an independent nation, opening the Iranian embassy in autumn of 1964, in Algiers.\n\nFor its part, Algeria, as a mediator, led the initiative to address the border dispute between Iran and Iraq in 1975. It hosted a meeting with the Iranian and Iraqi officials in attendance that led to the signing of a deal known as \""the Algiers Agreement\"".\n\nFollowing the victory of 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, bilateral ties between the two nations developed and the two countries intensified meetings and exchanges culminating in the adoption of similar stances on an array of international issues, particularly the problems faced by the World of Islam like the ones in Palestine and Syria. Algeria is one of countries which have independent positions close to those of Iran on many issues, including in terms of its political literature.\n\nAnother accord was inked between Iran and the USA due to the mediation of Algeria during the US embassy takeover in Tehran. Algiers Accord became another cause for better ties between Iran and Algeria. However, both counties' relations experienced some ups and downs. Yet, in the wake of the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000, Tehran and Algiers resumed diplomatic relations and since then these relations keep flourishing, maintaining common approaches to regional and international issues. Algeria opposed the Arab League members on giving the Syrian seat in the League to the Syrian opposition, and Algiers resisted taking any kind of military action in Syria, and as for Hezbollah and Hamas, Algeria objected putting their names on the terrorist group list in the Arab League.\n\nSince the very beginning of the nuclear talks and even before the conclusion of the JCPOA, Algeria was positive about Iran's peaceful nuclear activities and constantly and explicitly defended Iran's right in international bodies. Following the implementation of the nuclear deal finalized by Iran and six world powers in July 2015, known as the JCPOA, Algeria considered the deal as an important stage in the process of the settlement of the tension and crisis situations, in a view to preserving international peace and security, and development in the benefit of all the peoples.\n\nAlgiers had, in 2015, received the first vice president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Eshaq Jahangiri, just after expressing refusal to join the Saudi coalition. The beginning of a deeper cooperation between the two countries is, therefore, also a clear message sent to Riyadh: Algiers wants to diversify its cooperation with Iran, avoiding getting into a diplomatic game that would be dictated by the Americans. Iran's Hassan Rouhani said the two countries have always backed each other in difficult times and today, whereas the Algerian side stressed that Tehran-Algiers relations would witness further expansion in all domains during the new Algerian administration's tenure."
ABU ZUBAYDAH,1,"A former commander of the most secretive part of the prison compound told how the accused plotters of the Sept. 11 attacks were guarded by a secret force dressed like U.S. troops.\n\nThis article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\n\nGUANTÁNAMO BAY, Cuba -- In the months after their arrival at Guantánamo in 2006 from years in C.I.A. detention, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and the other accused plotters of the Sept. 11 attacks were guarded by a secret force disguised as United States troops and kept isolated in individual cells, unable to communicate with each other, a former commander testified Friday.\n\nThe account of their early days at Guantánamo emerged in a pretrial hearing on Friday in the case of Mr. Mohammed and four other men accused of conspiring in the 2001 attacks. The commander's testimony amounted to the most comprehensive view yet of Guantánamo's most mysterious prison, known as Camp 7, and the secret unit, called Task Force Platinum, that has guarded it since its inception.\n\nLawyers for Mr. Mohammed and the other defendants want the judge to exclude from their death-penalty trial, scheduled to start in January 2021, what they told F.B.I. agents in early 2007, months after they got to Guantánamo. The defense lawyers say those interrogations -- carried out by what prosecutors say were \clean teams\"" from the F.B.I. who were unfamiliar with evidence unlawfully obtained from the defendants during the years they were in C.I.A. custody and subject to torture -- were in fact tainted by years of clandestine C.I.A.-F.B.I. collaboration.\n\nThe defense lawyers argue that the prisoners provided the same answers to F.B.I. agents in 2007 that they had previously given to the C.I.A. at black sites where they were punished for not cooperating, and did not believe, based on conditions at Guantánamo, that they had free choice to refuse.\n\nTo rebut the defense, prosecutors on Friday called the former Army officer who served as the first commander of Camp 7. He testified about how he took custody of the accused Sept. 11 plotters and other C.I.A. prisoners as they came off a C-17 cargo plane in the dark of night at Guantánamo in September 2006 and, starting four months later, had his troops shepherd them to the F.B.I. interrogations.\n\nThe prisoners were told on the eve of an interrogation that they had an appointment the following day, which they could chose to attend. The commander said he never told them they were to be F.B.I. interrogations but checked with them the next morning on whether they would go to the appointments. They took place at a portion of the Guantánamo prison compound called Camp Echo II.\n\nThe former Army officer, who came to court in a sports jacket and tie, testified anonymously at the insistence of case prosecutors. He described a security regime set up by the Bush administration in September 2006 as it acknowledged to the world, for the first time, that it had held and interrogated prisoners in secret sites around the world starting in 2002.\n\nAccounts of the violence the C.I.A. used in the black sites -- waterboarding, beatings, sleep deprivation, rectal abuse and hanging their captives by their wrists -- would emerge later.\n\nOnce at Guantánamo, according to the Camp 7 commander, the 14 prisoners were taken to their new cells, showered and provided with \""fresh clothes.\"" The prisoners included Mr. Mohammed as well as a Saudi man now awaiting a capital trial as the accused mastermind of Al Qaeda's 2000 bombing of the U.S.S. Cole warship of Yemen and a never-charged Palestinian man known as ENTITY, who was the first detainee to be waterboarded in C.I.A. custody.\n\nMost of the commander's testimony on Friday occurred in a hearing closed to journalists because prosecutors invoked a national security privilege over much of the information about how the prison was set up and who worked there.\n\nFor example, the former commander was forbidden to describe in open court what the 14 former black site captives were wearing or how they looked when they arrived in 2006. Nor did he explain in his testimony why the guards who worked for him on the cellblocks wore United States military uniforms but were not employees of the Defense Department, a remark that suggested they were C.I.A. agents or contractors disguised as soldiers. Their uniforms bore no ranks and had pseudonyms where their names belonged.\n\nThe former commander also said he disagreed with a finding of a Senate Intelligence Committee that Camp 7 was \""under the operational control of the C.I.A.\"" He said he worked directly for the overall Guantánamo detention center commander at the time, Rear Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr. of the Navy.\n\nDuring their first Ramadan at Guantánamo, the commander said, the Camp 7 prisoners ate alone, prayed alone and had no contact with each other. A recorded prayer call piped through a speaker system announced prayer times.\n\nThe prison provided them with halal meals, which the guards delivered by opening two doors leading to their cells and then unlocked a slot in the innermost door.\n\nIn time, they were allowed to exit the back door of their cell to an enclosed recreation yard that has been described as a cell made of chain-linked fencing surrounded by camouflage netting with a restricted view of foliage on one side. Later, the Pentagon sent word that the prisoners could have recreation time in pairs, in separate cells.\n\nA lead prosecutor, Robert Swann, disclosed for the first time during the hearing that an F.B.I. agent came to Guantánamo in November 2007 with an unusual request for the guard force. The agent got permission to bring a six- to eight-inch hair brush to an interrogation of Mr. Mohammed to photograph him holding it.\n\nThe anonymous Camp 7 commander said the agent was photographing how Mr. Mohammed \""held the brush\"" to \""compare it to the time when he had a weapon in his hand to murder someone.\"" Mr. Swann said that the agent was trying to establish if the hand that held the brush matched the hand of a man on a videotape beheading Daniel Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter, in Pakistan in 2002.\n\nMr. Mohammed has never been charged with killing Mr. Pearl, although Pakistan prosecuted several other men for the kidnapping and killing"
ABU SAYYAF GROUP,1,"Before we begin, for those who are not intelligence specialists, these axioms must be, if not learned, at least introduced.\n\nBehind the curtain exists a Deep State, a world super-government that will minimally influence and in most cases control national governments.\n\nGovernments are controlled to control resources, to manipulate markets through manufactured needs and shortages, through currencies, though militarization and humanity is little but fodder, tolerated only so long as it serves these efforts.\n\nIf two million are killed in Vietnam or Iraq or Afghanistan, the Deep State only counts its profits, the dead mean nothing.\n\nGovernments are fragile. Elections can be rigged, politicians purchased for a paltry sum and in a world where \everyone has a price,\"" anyone worth purchasing has been purchased.\n\nThus, every demonstration can be controlled or \""turned\"" in some way, every government can be destabilized and today, with the power of corrupt social media monoliths and Google Corporation, a massive psychological war begins not only on nations but individuals, all individuals, who are subject to the most dangerous addiction of all, electronic devices.\n\nAfter so many years, the most recent set up Middle East wars should be examined with skepticism and those involved assumed to be employees of Western intelligence agencies, faker than fake.\n\nWith the dramatic and somewhat manic and incoherent announcement by American President Donald Trump of the killing of \""chief head chopper\"" and \""super-villain,\"" Baghdadi, alleged head of ISIS or ISIL or Daesh, an analyst or intelligence specialist might well drown in skepticism or simply quit from frustration.\n\nThere are a thousand reasons the Baghdadi killing is fake, but top of the list is this one, there are no ISIS fighters, no facilities, no groups friendly to ISIS within hundreds of miles from where he was allegedly chased down by a dog.\n\nThose of us who know how the US works too well, those who had worked on similar projects, are fearful for different reasons. I once spent several weeks hunting Americans in South Vietnam, so very long ago, who had commanded a Viet Cong unit, the Q84 company.\n\nIt seems more than a few American joined the Viet Cong, not pilots mind you, but \""tip of the spear\"" special operations troops.\n\nThen again, half a century later and that story is forgotten. It may well be classified still, I can wait and find out, I guess.\n\nThen of course we will mention the bin Laden story in the most cursory manner. Reported dead on December 3, 2001 by even Fox News, after denying any complicity in the 9/11 terror attacks, he rose from the grave 6 inches shorter and with entirely different facial features for a long career of audio recordings carefully timed to distract audiences from endless American scandals, massive corruption, a badly botched hurricane recovery effort, a story too lengthy to get into now but fascinating all the same.\n\nThen back to Baghdadi and Trump's performance, which in itself was a humiliation for Americans, or at least literate and mentally stable Americans, a group that still exists despite efforts by American media to prove otherwise.\n\nThe entire idea is absurd according to Major General Igor Konashenkov of Russia's Defense Ministry, who initially reported the that the alleged raid was not seen by Russia's S400 radars, which everyone knows see everything, even the smallest drone a few feet off the ground.\n\nThat report was scrubbed by Google and Facebook but exists still on Tass.\n\n\""Russia's defense ministry has no reliable information about an operation by US forces in the Turkey-controlled part of the Idlib de-escalation zone aimed at another extermination of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,\"" he said.\n\nHe said that the fact that the number of those who say about their participation in al-Baghdadi's extermination and share contradictory details of the operation make one doubt that such an operation ever took place.\n\n\""We know nothing about any assistance to the flight of US aircraft to the Idlib de-escalation zone's airspace in the course of this operation,\"" Konashenkov said.\n\nAmericans and others in the West won't have this information, Google and Facebook delisted it and any publications that carried this language, but it exists just the same.\n\nYet another report about the extermination of al-Baghdadi can hardly influence the situation in Syria, Konashenkov said.\n\n\""After Islamic State was ultimately defeated by the Syrian government army with support of the Russia aerospace forces in early 2018, yet another 'death' of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi will have no impact either on the situation in Syria or on the actions of terrorists staying in Idlib,\"" he said.\n\nNo airstrikes by US forces reported from Syria's Idlib\n\nNo airstrikes by the US air force or by the US-led coalition have been reported from Syria's Idlib de-escalation zone in the recent days, Konashenkov noted.\n\n\""No airstrikes by either US air forces of the so-called international coalition have been registered in the Idlib de-escalation zone on Saturday and over the recent days,\"" Konashenkov said.\n\nApart from that the Russian defense ministry said it doubted that al-Baghdadi could be hiding on a territory controlled by Jabhat al-Nusra (outlawed in Russia as a terrorist organization) in Idlib.\n\n\""This organization has always unhesitatingly killed Islamic State fighters on the spot as key rivals for power in Syria. Bearing this in mind, the US or other participants in the operation should at least provide direct evidence that the former Islamic State leader had been safely staying on a territory controlled by the 'Syrian Al Qaeda (also outlawed in Russia),\"" he added.\n\nYou can't talk about ISIS without taking a cursory look at the White Helmets. According to the Russian government, this organization, an NGO which isn't an NGO as it gets its endless millions from NATO, fakes videos of alleged atrocities and has, itself, killed hundreds, even thousands.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming and has been presented time and time again, science, video analysis, witness statements and eventually 40 White Helmets themselves who told the world court that they were hired as actors to dupe the media.\n\nIt isn't just the White Helmets. You have the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights or several fake medical groups that report each attack on a terrorist operations center as the \""barrel bombing\"" of an orphanage or hospital.\n\nHowever, it is necessary that we return to background. After years of reports of ISIS operating with aid from the US and other nations delisted and censored, truth has become a rare commodity.\n\nWhile in Syria I reviewed statements made by captured ISIS employees in the custody of the Syrian Justice Ministry. Syria was holding these people for a period of time, debriefing them and resettling them with their families, thousands of them, many of whom now serve with the Syrian Arab Army.\n\nThough some were from Syria, others came from Malaysia, Indonesia, China and the Philippines, even Australia. They were given travel documents and passports that passed high level scrutiny and were flown to regions close enough to Syria to be trucked in by NGO's, often fake medical organization or refugee groups, that, in fact, were really run by Western intelligence agencies.\n\nAll the while, normal business travelers or tourists with their children would find themselves questioned and turned back if they attempted the same travel routes. This tells you who ISIS really is.\n\nThen I looked at the record of ISIS' real commanders, military officers from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, one even a Brigadier General from Israel, captured by Shiite Militias. I saw his identification papers and those of dozens of other ISIS leaders who still carried military identification from nations in the region. None were named \""Baghdadi.\""\n\nOne was an American Major General, a former head of psychological warfare and later commentator on Fox News who was rescued from Syrian commandos by the US Delta Force, an organization founded by one of Veterans Today's advisory board members.\n\nThat raid, on May 15, 2015, was fictionalized in this ABC News report from that period:\n\n\""In a ground raid deep in Syrian territory, U.S. special operations forces killed a top ISIS leader who they were attempting to capture and interrogate about American hostages and how the terror group finances its war machine, the Obama administration said today.\n\nOfficials told ABC News that the large-scale operation that killed ISIS oil and gas \""minister\"" ENTITY was carried out by the Army's elite counter-terror unit known as Delta Force under the direction of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC).\""\n\nThe American general, who Russian sources said had planned ISIS military actions against Iraq, was rescued as a force of Syrian commandos and Russian Spetznaz approached.\n\nThis was a real military success for the US, one where those involved deserved great credit even though it was done, as is too often the case, to advance the cause of international terrorism.\n\nYou see, whoever Baghdadi is or was, and there are two stories, one that he was released from prison by Americans, trained in Jordan, and put in command of ISIS, in a real sense he never existed.\n\nThe other story, one with more support, is that he is a British citizen of Jewish heritage named Shimon Elliott, trained in Israel to pass for an Arab, as thousands of Israeli intelligence operatives have over the years, and serve as \""fake commander\"" for an equally fake terror group, ISIS.\n\nWhoever Baghdadi is or was, and reports from Russian sources inside Syria say he is Iraq under American protection, it is reasonably sane to assume that his persona was fabricated to put a face on an intelligence operation that obviously advanced the cause of Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States against Russia, Iraq, Syria and Iran, a simple continuation of the wars begun after 9/11.\n\nTo understand why ISIS exists or who created al Qaeda in its many guises, this May 2, 2007 quote from General Wesley Clark, former Chairman of the JCOS and NATO commander under President Clinton will help. The interviewer is Amy Goodman from Democracy Now, General Clark speaking:\n\n\""But, you know, history doesn't repeat itself exactly twice. What I did warn about when I testified in front of Congress in 2002, I said if you want to worry about a state, it shouldn't be Iraq, it should be Iran. But this government, our administration, wanted to worry about Iraq, not Iran.\n\nI knew why, because I had been through the Pentagon right after 9/11. About ten days after 9/11, I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the Joint Staff who used to work for me, and one of the generals called me in. He said, 'Sir, you've got to come in and talk to me a second.' I said, 'Well, you're too busy.' He said, 'No, no.\"" He says, 'We've made the decision we're going to war with Iraq.\"" This was on or about the 20th of September. I said, 'We're going to war with Iraq? Why?' He said, 'I don't know.' He said, 'I guess they don't know what else to do.' So, I said, 'Well, did they find some information connecting Saddam to al-Qaeda?' He said, 'No, no.' He says, 'There's nothing new that way. They just made the decision to go to war with Iraq.' He said, 'I guess it's like we don't know what to do about terrorists, but we've got a good military and we can take down governments.' And he said, 'I guess if the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail.'\n\nSo, I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan. I said, 'Are we still going to war with Iraq?' And he said, 'Oh, it's worse than that.' He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper. And he said, 'I just got this down from upstairs' -- meaning the Secretary of Defense's office -- 'today.' And he said, 'This is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran.' I said, 'Is it classified?' He said, 'Yes, sir.' I said, 'Well, don't show it to me.' And I saw him a year or so ago, and I said, 'You remember that?' He said, 'Sir, I didn't show you that memo! I didn't show it to you!'\""\n\nWithout this statement from General Clark, to an extent a man who had outlived his time, it would be impossible to put a perspective on today's events.\n\nDid America create ISIS and al Qaeda? The probability of a \""yes\"" for that would be 100%. Can history be used as proof? If not, proof of every kind exists and control of the internet, buying the media, filling it with paid \""operatives\"" and silencing truthtellers has not been enough.\n\nWhy did Baghdadi have to die, a real or imaginary Baghdadi who died a real or imaginary death? The issue is always timing.\n\nLook at the most recent death of Osama bin Laden and note, Baghdadi has died several times before, once in an Israeli hospital in 2015 according to media reports.\n\nWith bin Laden, who sources say died in 2001, a daring operation in Pakistan, by operatives who mysteriously died in a helicopter crash soon after, the timing was even more curious.\n\nCIA Director Leon Panetta was retiring, and this operation was the last of his career. He was being replaced by General Petraeus and, according to sources, it was necessary to \""kill off\"" the endless number of fake bin Laden's so that Petraeus, a potential presidential candidate for the opposition party, would never be able to take credit.\n\nWe are reminded of SEAL Team 6, credited with the bin Laden raid, from the statement made by President Obama on their fate:\n\n\""Their deaths are a reminder of the extraordinary sacrifices made by the men and women of our military and their families, including all who have served in Afghanistan,'' President Obama said Saturday. 'We will draw inspiration from their lives and continue the work of securing our country and standing up for the values that they embodied.'\""\n\nOf recent events, Jeffrey Epstein killing himself in prison, Baghdadi being hunted down somewhere he could never be by people flying invisible planes coordinated with governments that say it never happened, we could go on forever.\n\nAll the while, the plan Wesley Clark read on that piece of paper so many years ago, plans made by absurd people serving an invisible master, has since become ingrained in history.\n\nGordon Duff is a Marine combat veteran of the Vietnam War that has worked on veterans and POW issues for decades and consulted with governments challenged by security issues. He's a senior editor and chairman of the board of Veterans Today, especially for the online magazine \""New Eastern Outlook.\""\n\nfrom https://journal-neo.org/2019/11/01/baghdadi-the-invisible-leader-of-a-fake-army/"
ABU SAYYAF GROUP,1,"MANILA - Despite the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and uncertainty surrounding the leadership of the terror group, the Mindanao region of southern Philippines is a new den of radical militants, where local militia give shelter to and train with foreign terrorists who have fled the extinct caliphate.\n\nENTITY, Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, Ansar Khalifa Philippines and the Maute group are the main groups affiliated with the IS in the Philippines.\n\nAlthough these groups don't have the capacity to establish a new caliphate, they have embraced forms of violence such as suicide attacks, a new phenomenon in the Southeast Asian country.\n\n\Mindanao is viewed to be a new land of jihad, a safe haven and an alternative home base by foreign terrorist fighters,\"" the chairman of the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research, Rommel Banlaoi, told EFE.\n\nThe analyst said that the southern Philippines is currently home to more than a hundred foreign terrorists from Malaysia, Indonesia and the Middle East, who are importing more violent methods to employ in their armed struggle.\n\nThe demise in March of the ruthless caliphate across Syria and Iraq declared in 2014 by Baghdadi prompted an exodus of terrorists to the Philippines, taking advantage of the weak controls at the airports and porous ports dotting the Mindanao coast, he added.\n\nAccording to Banlaoi, the manner of Baghdadi's death - he detonated his suicide vest in Syria on Sunday during a United States special forces raid - \""may intensify the nature of terrorist violence in Mindanao\"" due to the method \""which is an act of martyrdom for ISIS (another name for the IS) followers.\""\n\n\""Suicide terrorism is the current face of terror in the Philippines. Future trends can include children and youth in suicide terrorism,\"" he warned, in reference to the new tactics being employed by insurgent groups, which attract young people in poor and volatile Muslim Mindanao through a powerful propaganda machine on the internet.\n\nAlthough Islamist terrorism is not new in the Philippines, suicide attacks do not correspond to the classic modus operandi of local groups and pose a new threat in the country which, in the past year, has recorded four attacks of this kind, the first in its history and all claimed by the IS.\n\nThe first attack took place on July 31, 2018 on Basilan island - the traditional stronghold of ENTITY - where a dozen people were killed, followed by twin blasts in January in a cathedral in Jolo, the capital of Sulu, one of the most deadly attacks in the country's history with around 20 deaths and 100 injured.\n\nThe other two attacks, in June and September, targeted military camps in Sulu, a hard-to-reach archipelago that has become the new bastion of ENTITY, currently the strongest insurgent group with over 300 members in that area alone.\n\nIt is there that Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan, ENTITY's leader and new emir of the IS in Southeast Asia, has been hiding following the death of Isnilon Hapilon in the five-month Battle of Marawi that ended in October 2017.\n\nThe June attack was conducted by 20-year-old Norman Lasuca, an ENTITY militant and the first Filipino behind a suicide bombing, yet another symptom of the radicalization of local extremist groups.\n\nPhilippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana described Baghdadi's death as \""just a momentary setback, considering the depth and reach of the organization worldwide, particularly in the Philippines.\""\n\nHowever, the director of the International Observatory on Terrorism Studies, Carlos Igualada, pointed out that Philippine insurgent groups were greatly weakened after their defeat in the Battle of Marawi following their occupation of the heart of that Muslim city in the southern Philippines.\n\n\""I do not believe that Baghdadi's death will have much impact on the evolution of the jihadist movement in Southeast Asia because the groups in the region are focused on recovering the capacity that they had before Marawi, immersed in a process of reorganization, especially in positions of leadership,\"" he told EFE.\n\nIgualada also noted that Philippine extremist groups, despite many swearing allegiance to IS in 2014, have retained their independence and the influence of the caliphate was limited to the ideological level, with a leadership that was autonomous of Baghdadi.\n\nHowever, an estimated 800 Southeast Asian militants went to Syria to fight in the caliphate, many of whom have managed to escape the prison camps in which they were held.\n\n\""That poses a risk to Southeast Asia, which may be attacked by these returned fighters, which is the biggest concern for counter-terrorism,\"" Igualada added.\n\nFor Luke Lischin, an investigator of the United States' National War College, the links between the IS and Philippine extremism, especially ENTITY, is limited to ideology, but he also warns of the danger of the arrival in the country of fighters from Syria and Iraq \""in search of a new battleground.\"
ABU SAYYAF GROUP,1,"In 1971, Saul Alinsky published a book called Rules for Radicals in which the father of modern community organizing shared lessons he had learned over the years for successful protest. But the problem with Rules for Radicals is that protesters often conclude that protesting isn't enough. Historically, many social movements have escalated to violence after nonviolence failed.\n\nMichael Collins, for example, determined that \Irish Independence would never be attained by constitutional means\"" and that \""when you're up against a bully you've got to kick him in the guts.\"" In his memoire, Irgun leader Menachem Begin described the Zionist group's predicament after nonviolence failed to protect the Yishuv: \""What use was there in writing memoranda? What value in speeches? No, there was no other way. If we did not fight we should be destroyed.\"" When asked why they adopted violence in the 1950s, Algerian nationalists complained that the French had just shrugged off their futile strikes and boycotts. In her autobiography from the American Weather Underground, Susan Stern explained why her radical left-wing group escalated: \""As the years have passed, I've seen my efforts fail with thousands of others in the Civil Rights and anti-war movements. The time has come not merely to protest but to fight for what we believe in.\"" The leader of the Tamil Tigers shared a similar rationale for why his group embraced violence: \""The Tamil people have been expressing their grievances...for more than three decades. Their voices went unheard like cries in the wilderness.\"" The African National Congress released a similar statement in July 1963 about why it ramped up its anti-apartheid tactics: \""It can now truly be said that very little, if any, scope exists for the smashing of white supremacy other than by means of mass revolution action, the main content of which is armed resistance leading to victory by military means.\"" The truth is that some radicals will become rebels, and there are rules for them, too.\n\nMy book, Rules for Rebels, starts off where Rules for Radicals ends. It analyzes hundreds of militant groups from all over the world to discern why some succeed and others fail. I come with welcome news for the rebel leader. My research reveals that he possesses a surprising amount of agency over his political destiny. Triumph is possible. But only when he knows what to do. It turns out there's a science to victory in militant history. But even rebels must follow rules.\n\nSmart militant leaders do three simple things to increase the odds of victory.\n\nThe first rule is for the leader to recognize that not all violence is equal for achieving his stated political goals. In fact, smart leaders grasp that some attacks should be carefully avoided because they're deeply counterproductive for the cause. My research is the first to empirically demonstrate that there's variation in the political utility of attacks depending on the target. Compared with more selective violence against military and other government targets, indiscriminate violence against civilian targets lowers the likelihood of political success. So the first thing smart militants do is recognize that civilian attacks are a recipe for political failure. You might say that the first rule for rebels is to not use terrorism at all. There's no consensus over the definition of terrorism. But most scholars define it as attacks against civilian targets in particular. When we talk about terrorism, we mean attacks on civilian targets like schools, markets, movie theaters, rock concerts, soccer games, commercial airplanes, cruise ships, mosques, businesses and apartment buildings unless occupied by military personnel. We're certainly not talking about blowing the treads off a tank. What matters for the militant leader, though, isn't how we define terrorism, but that he learns the folly of harming civilians.\n\nThe second rule is to actively restrain lower-level members from harming civilians. It doesn't matter whether the leader understands the futility of terrorism if his members continue to do it. The key is for the leader to centralize the organization, so he can educate fighters to avoid civilians, discipline those who harm civilians and vet out prospective members who seem prone to undermining the cause with terrorism.\n\nAnd the third rule is for the leader to distance the organization from terrorism whenever wayward subordinates flout his targeting guidelines by attacking civilians. Like CEOs, smart militant leaders know how to brand their organization for maximum appeal when members publicly shame it. In practice, this means denying organizational responsibility when members kill civilians. Or when caught red-handed, apologizing for the terrorist attack and blaming it on rogue fighters to highlight that their grisly methods run counter to the ideals of the group.\n\nWhen you look scientifically at the history of militant groups, one thing becomes immediately clear about the Islamic State (ISIS): Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was one stupid leader. Baghdadi could have written a book called Rules for Rebels to Fail. Indeed, he did the exact opposite of what smart leaders have historically done to achieve their stated political goals.\n\nBaghdadi clearly didn't understand the most important rule of sparing civilians to reduce the audience costs. Like Antar Zouabri of the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi of the Al-Qaeda affiliate in Iraq and other imbecilic militant leaders throughout world history, Baghdadi failed to appreciate that blowing up innocent people only jeopardizes the cause by turning the population against you and reducing the likelihood of political concessions. This is true, I find, even in hostage settings, where killing even one civilian substantially lowers the odds of governments making any concessions at all to the perpetrators.\n\nTo maximize the civilian carnage, Baghdadi also flouted the second rule by decentralizing ISIS' recruitment and operations. By 2016, he had accepted the \""bayat,\"" or allegiance, of 43 terrorist group affiliates, from Boko Haram in Nigeria to ENTITY in the Philippines. Now, they were all fighting under the black banner. Where affiliates didn't exist to maximize the bloodletting, he appealed to lone wolf terrorists to kill essentially anyone on their wish list.\n\nAnd Baghdadi broke the third cardinal rule by publicly broadcasting in lurid detail ISIS' heinous crimes against civilians over social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Rather than denying organizational responsibility for the carnage, he encouraged members to brag about it, leaving no doubt that his group was the baddest one on the block.\n\nThis was a terrific strategy for attracting sociopaths to the group, but quickly turned other militant organizations against it, dried up local support and elicited the largest counterterrorism coalition ever assembled, costing his life along with the caliphate. The media fixated on every known foreign fighter to join ISIS, while ignoring the bigger picture that its attrition rate had steadily outstripped its recruitment rate.\n\nBecause most militant leaders restrain the rank-and-file, taking them out with drones or other means typically increases the amount of organizational violence against civilians by empowering less strategic lower-level members. But Baghdadi's death won't increase the amount of terrorism because he was too dense to recognize its limitations. Baghdadi was like a CEO so incompetent that losing him will have no discernible effect on the firm's performance.\n\nMax Abrahms is a professor of political science at Northeastern University and the author of Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History."

ABU SAYYAF GROUP,1,"People look at a destroyed house near the village of Barisha in Syria's Idlib province, after a U.S. military operation that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Oct. 27, 2019. AP\n\nSoutheast Asian nations have beefed up security to thwart possible \revenge attacks\"" after the killing of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, officials said Monday, even as counter-terrorism agencies in the region felt his death would not dampen the resilience of local militants.\n\nAl-Baghdadi, who became the world's most-wanted terrorist after he declared a so-called caliphate in Mosul, Iraq, in 2014, killed himself and three of his children when he detonated a suicide vest during a raid by U.S. forces in northwest Syria's Idlib region, President Donald Trump announced Sunday.\n\nIn Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, officials warned of the possibility of attacks by local militants sympathetic to Baghdadi in a bid to avenge the death of the IS leader, who had led the jihadist group since 2010.\n\n\""All [militant] networks have been monitored by Densus 88,\"" Indonesian national police spokesman Asep Adi Saputra told BenarNews, referring to the country's elite counter-terrorism strike force. \""But, still, the recent event has prompted us to be more alert to anticipate possible revenge attacks by al-Baghdadi supporters.\""\n\nThe first terrorist attack claimed by IS in Southeast Asia was in Indonesia, more than three years ago.\n\nIn January 2016, authorities blamed a local IS-linked group known as Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) for a gun and bomb attack that killed eight people, including the four attackers, in Jakarta's central business district.\n\nJAD was also blamed for coordinated attacks in the Indonesian city of Surabaya in May 2018, when two families carried out suicide bombings on three churches and a police station. Twenty-four people were killed, including the attackers who used their children as young as 9 in the bombings.\n\nRidlwan Habib, a security analyst at the University Indonesia, said al-Baghdadi's killing could prompt IS's local supporters to launch revenge attacks, as he urged Jakarta to remain on alert, \""because even though he is dead, the ideology is still alive.\""\n\n\""It is possible that some followers are determined to avenge his death,\"" he told BenarNews. \""Some may even be inspired by al-Baghdadi and blow themselves up with a bomb vest.\""\n\nGovernments in Southeast Asia, home to more than 270 million Muslims, have been concerned over IS expanding its network in the region ever since the militant group lost control of its self-proclaimed caliphate - wide swaths of land covering an area as big as Great Britain - in parts of Syria and Iraq in March.\n\nIn the Philippines, where IS-linked local militants launched a major siege that devastated the southern city of Marawi two years ago, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said he believed that al-Baghdadi's death was \""just a momentary setback\"" for IS, considering the militant group's reach worldwide.\n\n\""Somebody will take his place to lead the IS. Maybe not as famous and well known,\"" Lorenzana told reporters.\n\nMilitary officials placed troops in the restive southern Philippines on heightened alert Monday for possible \""sympathy attacks.\""\n\nThe precautionary move was taken just before the Catholic country was to shut down for annual All Souls' and All Saints Day holiday this coming weekend, when millions of Filipinos were expected to visit cemeteries and pay respects to the dead.\n\nAmong IS-linked groups in southern Philippines is the ENTITY, which President Rodrigo Duterte has vowed to crush after it was linked to deadly attacks on civilian and military targets, as well as numerous abductions, including foreigners.\n\nA key ENTITY faction is led by Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan, who has been identified as the new leader of the IS affiliate operating in the southern Philippines. He took over from Isnilon Hapilon, who was killed when Philippine government troops regained the city of Marawi two years ago.\n\nHapilon was believed to have led the IS in Southeast Asia before he was killed.\n\nLt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, commander of Philippine Army's Western Mindanao Command, told BenarNews that al-Baghdadi was not well-known among low-ranking members of militant groups in the Philippines.\n\n\""Here in the Philippines during my custodial debriefing from among those who have surrendered to us, they don't really know about this [IS leader named] al-Baghdadi,\"" Sobejana said.\n\n\""I should say the impact is lesser in as far as if they want to project it as martyrdom,\"" he said. \""Not that much, unless those who were commanding [local militants] will ... motivate the followers to avenge.\""\n\n'The terror threat will continue'\n\nMalaysia, a Muslim-majority nation of 33 million people has experienced one IS-linked attack so far but the nation was mostly concerned about \""lone-wolf attacks\"" involving individuals radicalized through online propaganda, according to Malaysian police counter-terrorism chief Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay.\n\n\""The terror threat will continue to exist if we fail to deal with the ideologies spread by IS or the other groups that hold onto the same ideologies,\"" he told BenarNews.\n\nMalaysian authorities have arrested 495 people linked to alleged terror activities since 2013, according to government figures compiled by BenarNews. Dozens have been freed but no clear number is available.\n\nMalaysia's first IS-linked terror attack took place on June 26, 2016, when a grenade blast injured eight patrons at the Movida nightclub in Puchong town near Kuala Lumpur. Authorities blamed that attack on Islamic State.\n\nBut the nation also faces threats from local IS sympathizers and regional militant groups, including the ENTITY, whose suspected members had been arrested during police crackdowns in Sabah in recent months.\n\nIn Thailand, where a decades-long Muslim insurgency in the country's Deep South has killed thousands, analysts do not expect Baghdadi's death to have any influence on rebels.\n\nThai authorities earlier this month denied any connection between IS and the Deep South insurgents, despite the recent arrest of a Thai student in Egypt on suspicion of belonging to the terror group.\n\n\""Our enquiries have found no link between the people in the three southernmost provinces and the Islamic State,\"" Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters.\n\nSecurity analyst Don Pathan told BenarNews that al-Baghdadi's killing was not expected to have any impact on militant groups in Southeast Asia.\n\nTrump said al-Baghdadi, who was believed to be 48, died Saturday when he detonated his suicide vest in a tunnel while being pursued by U.S. Special Forces. \""There wasn't much left,\"" Trump told reporters, referring to al-Baghdadi's remains. \""But there are still substantial pieces that they [special forces] brought back\"" for identification, he said.\n\nAmong the 31,500 foreign fighters who had joined IS in Syria, about 800 came from Asia, including 400 from Indonesia, Indonesia's Defense chief Ryamizard Ryacudu told BenarNews in June last year, citing intelligence data from his government.\n\nAl-Baghdadi's 'Inspirational approach'\n\nMunira Mustaffa, a Malaysian terrorism researcher at American University in Washington told BenarNews that al-Baghdadi's decision to kill himself using a suicide vest could be an \""inspirational approach to signal to his followers to do the same.\""\n\n\""I don't think there's going to be much impact on Malaysian IS sympathizers given that he was pretty distant as a leader,\"" Munira said. \""However, I would be cautious with making any assumptions on how it would resonate with Indonesians.\""\n\nMeanwhile, Bangladeshi Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan on Monday urged countries around the world to \""work together to stop resurgence of such notorious outfit\"" as the IS.\n\n\""Islamic State (IS) has never been Islamic,\"" Khan told BenarNews. \""This notorious militant outfit is synonymous with mass murder, genocide, slaughter, destruction, arson and all other notorious activities. ... So, killing of its chief al-Baghdadi is good news for the world.\""\n\nBangladesh has been targeted in terrorist attacks in recent years, most notably the July 2016 siege of a Dhaka café in which militants hacked to death 20 hostages. IS claimed responsibility for the attack, but Bangladeshi officials adamantly denied that it was linked to IS or that the group had a presence in the South Asian nation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi government had \""apparently crushed\"" the local network of militants linked with the IS, such as the Neo-JMB, and it would be unlikely that Bangladesh would see retaliatory attacks as a result of al-Baghdadi's killing, security analyst Sakhawat Hossain, a retired Army brigadier general, told BenarNews.\n\n\""As the law-enforcement agencies in Bangladesh are very aggressive, they would not be able to carry out attacks in the near future,\"" Hossain said.\n\nBut, he said, militants \""would try to stage their capability at an opportune moment.\""\n\n\""We may see violent attacks by the sleeper cells in different countries in retaliation of Baghdadi's killing,\"" he said."

ABU SAYYAF GROUP,1,"The Syrian Civil War represents one of the most complex battlespaces in the history of modern warfare. Since the war began in 2013, the Syrian landscape has been pocked with regular Syrian forces, Russian military advisors, American special operations forces, rebel groups opposed to Bashar al-Assad, non-state groups in support of al-Assad, Islamist militias, Syrian Kurdish militias, terrorist organizations, and opportunist criminal enterprises. At one point, media reported an estimated 1,000 armed opposition groups, and most have divergent agendas.\n\nNotwithstanding the killing this weekend of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a U.S. military operation, those complexities are compounded by the increasing urgency of finding solutions to ensure accountability for individuals who might be responsible for war crimes and other atrocities and who have been detained by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. The recent focus on the untenable humanitarian and operational situation at the al-Hawl (Al Hol) refugee facility, along with the Turkish invasion into northern Syria, has brought those questions to the fore.\n\nAs with other armed conflicts, finding competent jurisdictions with the requisite resources to resolve atrocity crimes, particularly those committed by ISIS in Syria, is difficult. An examination of available jurisdictions and the feasibility of using each of them reveals what is clearly the best option to ensure accountability.\n\nJurisdiction represents the official power to make legal decisions and judgments, usually from a system of law courts. Building criminal cases against war criminals during or shortly after armed conflict is difficult to begin with, as criminal intelligence and law enforcement activities historically take a back seat to operational intelligence and military operations. Northeastern Syria represents even greater challenges due to the number of nationalities represented in the population of detained foreign fighters, lack of an effective international criminal accountability mechanism, disparate enforcement of extraterritorial jurisdiction laws of third countries, lack of effective documentation methods, a just-barely functioning court system in the self-administered region of Rojava in northeastern Syria that is running at maximum capacity, and a Syrian court system that knows no due process. All of that is exacerbated by the reticence of third countries such as the United Kingdom and France to repatriate their citizens so that they can be held accountable with better judicial resources and stronger guarantees of due process.\n\nOften, initial information during armed conflict about potential violations of international atrocities law -- covering war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity -- comes from observations and documentation from media and human rights organizations. Such information is rarely evidence quality and is stored away with the hope that one day, far into the future, some competent tribunal will take on a criminal case.\n\nThis practice fails to recognize that there are sometimes criminal jurisdictions immediately available to prosecute these crimes, or related crimes, under the domestic laws of those states where the violations occurred, or those states whose citizens have participated in the commission of crimes.\n\nCriminal jurisdiction requires official legal authority over a person due to his or her nationality, or jurisdiction over an offense committed within the sovereign territory by a person of any nationality. There is also universal jurisdiction, allowing states to prosecute certain international crimes regardless of where they have been committed or by whom. However, some states have chosen not to exercise universal jurisdiction. For example, the United Kingdom has chosen not to repatriate British nationals Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, two of the so-called \Beatles\"", and instead chose to strip them of their citizenship.\n\nIn northeastern Syria, there are multiple potential criminal jurisdictions available right now that could remove detained belligerents from seemingly indefinite pre-trial or security detention in sub-standard facilities, and subject them instead to due process where governments can achieve final accountability. However, prosecution in some of these jurisdictions is more feasible than others.\n\nSyrian \""Justice\""\n\nThe government of Syria has primary jurisdiction over offenses committed by ISIS for two reasons. First, the criminal activity committed by members of ISIS occurred on Syrian soil in violation of Syrian domestic law. Syria is a civil law system that has functioning criminal courts and well-educated lawyers. On paper, Syrian criminal law appears very similar to other civil law systems.\n\nThat said, despite having a written criminal code, Syrian criminal justice is not known for its guarantees of due process, but rather its pre-trial torture and post-trial mass executions after trials lasting several minutes. The disparity comes from non-legal forces that have authority greater than the law itself, namely a corrupt dictator with absolute power who is above his own laws.\n\nDespite being an available jurisdiction, justice in the Syrian system, without due process and the protection of the rights of an accused, is not the type of accountability that would be palatable to the international community.\n\nThe Rojava Option\n\nWhen stability in Syria first dissolved in 2012, the inhabitants of northeastern Syria attempted a level of democratic self-governance without the acquiescence of the Syrian government. The Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (NES), or Rojava as it is known in Syria, has been the de facto government in that region since 2012. Rojava has a constitution and a legal system that notably features a ban on the death penalty, female judges, a ban on extradition to death penalty countries like Iraq, and creative restorative justice. The courts have already tried thousands of Syrian ISIS suspects.\n\nOn the surface, this progressive-leaning system should be ripe for international support. Although it is successfully convicting thousands of ISIS members, it remains rudimentary in a number of respects. For example, it lacks forensic, fingerprinting, and DNA capability. This means defendants are convicted for violations of terrorism laws that are easy to prove (laws against the state) instead of more substantive crimes like rape, murder, and slavery (laws against people) that require more evidence than just membership in a terrorist organization. Further, trial and conviction for international crimes that capture the full extent of ISIS brutality, like war crimes and genocide, are impractical within that system.\n\nUnfortunately, several practical hurdles also stand in the way of international support of the nascent Rojavian justice system. Rojavian jurists are accused by the government of Syria of setting up and creating an illegal judiciary. Judges and staff face arrest warrants from Syria, lack passports, and are frequently subjected to death threats. Additionally, international engagement with the Rojavian courts is difficult since Rojava is not recognized as independent by any state and can only conduct limited foreign relations as a result. This makes governmental programming very difficult, if not impossible.\n\nRojavian authorities have asked the international community to set up an international war crimes tribunal based in Rojava, but there are significant obstacles to such a concept. First, the recent invasion of Syria by Turkish forces threatens to de-stabilize the region even further, raising the question to what extent the Rojavian government will be able to maintain any effective control over the area. Second, the creation of an international court in Rojava, against the wishes of the government of Syria, would violate Syrian sovereignty and would likely require the approval of the United Nations Security Council. Russia, China, and very likely even the United States would not approve such a measure. Finally, many states maintain a concern about the connection between Rojavian authorities and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in Turkey that the United States and others consider to be a terrorist organization.\n\nInternational Tribunals\n\nThe International Criminal Court, often lauded by human rights activists and victims of atrocities as the tribunal of choice, lacks jurisdiction to try ISIS members in Syria for the simple fact that Syria is not a party to the Rome Statute (nor were its crimes at issue here committed within a jurisdiction that is a party). This has not precluded other initiatives for international tribunals. Sweden has long supported the idea of an international tribunal to try ISIS members to fill the capability and jurisdiction challenges in Syria and Iraq.\n\nAn international tribunal has several advantages. First, such a tribunal can usually try criminal defendants for crimes under customary international law, like war crimes, capturing the full extent of a defendant's criminality. Second, international tribunals ordinarily recruit some of the world's best jurists. Third, international tribunals are neutral compared with those of an interested nation-state.\n\nOf course, there are practical issues hindering the effectiveness of all international tribunals. The first, and most chronic problem, is that their creation tends to move at a glacial pace, often resulting in stale accounts of facts and evidence tainted by time and battlefield mishandling. Second, the primary witnesses to atrocity crimes are often displaced persons who have no known address and are difficult to find when their testimony is needed at later dates. Third, because of a lack of capacity, international tribunals usually only focus on the most senior defendants, leaving more junior actors to be subjected to some other form of justice, or escape it entirely. Although senior members of terrorist organizations may be most responsible, often some of the more junior members carried out the most monstrous criminal acts.\n\nIraq's Terrorism Courts\n\nThe terrorism courts of Iraq are certainly available to try ISIS members for crimes against Iraq. In the past, the Iraqi courts have focused on defendants captured in Iraq, or Iraqi citizens captured in Syria, like the case of ISIS member Umm Sayyaf. Sayyaf was the wife of senior ISIS member ENTITY. She was captured by American special operations forces in 2015. As an Iraqi citizen, she was handed over to Iraq by the United States. Interestingly, she was tried in Erbil, the capitol of the semi-autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan Region, which has a de facto moratorium on the death penalty. Sayyaf was convicted of being a member of ISIS and sentenced to death by the Iraqi Kurdish terrorism court, although there is little chance of the sentence actually being carried out at this time.\n\nSayyaf has also been indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice under American laws. The United States has an extraterritorial jurisdiction statute that allows the prosecution of non-U.S. citizens for acts of terrorism that result in the death of an American citizen, in this case American aid worker Kayla Mueller.\n\nIraq has tried non-Iraqi members of ISIS captured in Syria, like the French ISIS member Mustapha Merzoughi, under Iraqi laws since ISIS is a transnational threat to the security of Iraq. Merzoughi is being tried in Iraqi courts because France refused to take him back. Whether Iraq will continue this practice or it is an aberration remains to be seen, considering the Iraqi Foreign Minister's statement this month that it is Iraqi policy to bring only Iraqi members of ISIS back to the country for trial.\n\nCompetent jurisdiction aside, the Iraqi criminal justice system is not well-respected by the international community: the trials are notoriously short, with little opportunity to confront accusers and cross-examine witnesses, and sentences are severe, often resulting in the death penalty. The exception is the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, which has a de facto moratorium on the death penalty.\n\nRepatriation Remains the Best Option - and a Long Shot\n\nAt least for third-country-national members of ISIS, the greatest chance of criminal accountability is for those states to repatriate their citizens and subject them to the judicial process at home. Most states have extraterritorial jurisdiction laws that allow them to have jurisdiction over serious crimes committed by their citizens worldwide. The United States has urged, with varying success, that other countries, especially in Europe, take their thousands of detained citizens back.\n\nMany European states have refused to take their fighters back, citing an inability to prove cases against suspects and a lack of resources to place returning jihadists under constant surveillance. The United States has warned that a failure to repatriate these individuals could result in them simply going free.\n\nRegardless of which countries try which members of ISIS, the international community needs to begin taking more decisive action if it is serious about bringing members of ISIS to justice. Without effective prosecutions, there is a danger of ISIS members going free.\n\nOr worse, ISIS members with no prospect of criminal trial may be subjected to a more \""political\"" disposition in Syria: extrajudicial killing. Using a tactic against ISIS that the group has used so brutally against its victims risks compounding the injustices of these conflicts and extending the cycles of violence."
ABU SAYYAF GROUP,1,"The death of ISIS' top leader in the Middle East may shift extremists' attention closer to home as they try to avenge his death and assert their influence, says leading terrorism analyst Rohan Gunaratna\n\nTERRORIST KILLED. An image grab taken from a propaganda video released on July 5, 2014 by al-Furqan Media allegedly shows the leader of the Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, addressing worshippers at a mosque in the ISIS-held northern Iraqi city of Mosul. Al-Furqan Media/Handout/AFP\n\nMANILA, Philippines - Filipino terror groups linked to Islamic State (ISIS) will \very likely\"" attempt violent attacks to avenge the reported killing on Sunday of ISIS top leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a leading terrorism analyst told journalists on Monday, October 28.\n\n\""As you know, in the Philippines itself, more than 3 dozen groups pledged allegiance to Islamic State. In Southeast Asia alone, there are more than 100 networks that pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. So it is very likely that at least some of these groups will mount revengeful attacks, or what they call retribution attacks,\"" said Rohan Gunaratna, professor of Security Studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technology University in Singapore.\n\nAlthough al-Baghdadi was a central figure in the ISIS lore that drew a following of tens of thousands of extremists from different parts of the world, the group's relative decline in the Middle East and the emergence of its \""provinces\"" elsewhere such as in the Philippines means its ideology, influence, and malevolence lives on.\n\n\""I think it was important that he was killed. He was a very ruthless and a very cruel leader. And he created a very effective legend, that he was the caliph, the leader of the Islamic State,\"" Gunaratna said.\n\n\""It has been shattered. But he has invested a lot of time and energy and organization to mobilize tens of thousands of people around the world. And now the world has to deal with those people,\"" he added.\n\nThe loss of al-Baghdadi, Gunaratna said, will further decentralize ISIS and push its regional tentacles to organize on their own.\n\nISIS in the Philippines\n\nSeveral extremist groups based in Mindanao have pledged allegiance to ISIS since it came to prominence for its ruthlessness and destructiveness in the Middle East in 2014.\n\nThe Maute group, named after the family that formed it, laid siege to Marawi City in May 2017. The 5-month battle with government forces killed more than 1,000 people, and marked the undeniable entry of ISIS ideology - the attempt to carve out an Islamic territory based on a brutal interpretation of the religion - into the Philippines.\n\nThe Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters faction led by Esmael Abdulmalik a.k.a. Abu Torayfie - the Dawlah Islamiyah Torayfie Group - has been blamed for several bombings and attacks in central Mindanao.\n\nThe ENTITY (ASG) faction in Basilan province led by Furuji Indama carried out what was believed to be the first suicide bombing in the Philippines, according to the military. On July 31, 2018, a \""foreign looking\"" suspect drove a van by a paramilitary checkpoint in the outskirts of Lamitan City, where it exploded, killing 10 people.\n\nAnother faction of the ASG based in Sulu province led by Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan was responsible for a series of suicide bombings in the province earlier this year. Attacks on a Catholic cathedral in Jolo town in January, a Philippine Army camp in Indanan town in June, and a military checkpoint also in Indanan in September, have killed a total of 32 people, including the bombers.\n\nOne of the suicide bombers in the June 28 attack in Indanan was Filipino, an unprecedented case according to the police and military.\n\nSawadjaan is known to be the leader of ISIS in the Philippines. Security officials earlier said he was harboring at least 7 foreign extremists in his hideout in Sulu to train suicide bombers, if not to do it themselves.\n\nAttacks unlikely?\n\nPhilippine security officials on Monday welcomed the report of al-Baghdadi's death. US President Donald Trump on Sunday said the ISIS leader detonated a suicide vest when he was cornered in a raid by US Special Forces in northwestern Syria.\n\nThe Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) said it was a \""severe blow\"" to terror groups around the world. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said as much, but added that al-Baghdadi's death was \""just a momentary setback\"" for ISIS.\n\nThe military downplayed the threat from local terrorists, saying it \""seriously doubts\"" there would be retaliatory attacks, according to AFP spokesperson Brigadier General Edgard Arevalo.\n\nNevertheless, government forces on the ground were \""ready for any eventuality,\"" Arevalo added.\n\nAlthough the leaders of local ISIS-linked groups will likely feel the impact of al-Baghdadi's loss, their \""rank and file\"" fighters probably know too little about him to get the urge to avenge his killing, said AFP Western Mindanao Command chief Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana.\n\nSobejana said he ordered troops under his command \""to intensify their intelligence operations, monitor the hostile plans of the ISIS-inspired groups here in the area, and take proactive measures so we do not just take it for granted...but there is no cause for alarm.\""\n\nISIS and Al Qaeda\n\nAlthough some local extremist groups are linked to ISIS in the Middle East by ideology, Gunaratna said they are mostly able to finance and organize their own operations, and are unlikely to feel the pinch should the mothership tank.\n\nMoreover, al-Baghdadi's rivalry with Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was pretty much the only thing that prevented ISIS and Al Qaeda from joining forces.\n\n\""When these leaders die, the younger leaders have no problem with cooperation and collaboration,\"" Gunaratna said, and wiith al-Baghdadi gone, the two terror organizations will likely \""come together.\""\n\nThat means local ISIS-linked groups may soon join forces with Al Qaeda-linked ones. For example, Sawadjaan's faction of the ASG might absorb the broader group led by the aging Radullan Sahiron, who rejected ISIS.\n\nISIS-inspired groups in Southeast Asia could pair up with the Indonesia-based Jemaah Islamiyah, which is linked to Al Qaeda.\n\nWith ISIS losing territory in Iraq and Syria, its leadership dispersing, and now, its apex leader killed, extremists in other parts of the world have less reason to fixate on the Middle East, and will likely shift their attention closer to home.\n\nTerrorism is \""morphing\"" and terrorists are \""changing their format,\"" Gunaratna warned.\n\n\""They are now returning to their own home countries, and they will build a new generation of fighters.... Governments will have to be prepared for that,\"" he added. - Rappler.com"
ABU SAYYAF GROUP,1,"Kayla Mueller, 26, was taken prisoner in 2013 after she crossed over the Turkish border to visit a hospital in war-ravaged Syria.\n\nThe parents of Kayla Mueller, who was raped and tortured by slain ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, say she could still be alive if Obama had been as decisive as Trump, as they revealed yesterday how they secretly met her captors after her death.\n\nPraising President Donald Trump on Sunday after the announcement of Baghdadi's death, Marsha Mueller told the Arizona Republic: 'I still say Kayla should be here, and if Obama had been as decisive as President Trump, maybe she would have been.'\n\nMeanwhile Carl Mueller, the 26-year-old's father, spoke of his gratitude to General Mark Milley for dedicating the mission to his daughter who died while an ISIS captive in 2015.\n\nHer body was never recovered, but Carl Mueller revealed he and his wife traveled from Arizona to Syria to try to recover her remains and met with an ISIS bride who had kept the American locked up for Baghdadi to sexually abuse.\n\nPresident Donald Trump praised Mueller as a 'beautiful young woman' on Sunday when he announced the death of the leader of the so-called caliphate, who blew himself up, along with three of his children, during a raid by US special forces.\n\n'We just learned that the whole thing was dedicated to Kayla thanks to General [Mark] Milley and it's very touching,' Carl Mueller told ABC News Sunday.\n\n'President Trump mentioned her today in his statement and he mentioned that he deserved what he got for what he did to Kayla.'\n\nKayla Mueller, an American humanitarian worker, was taken prisoner in 2013 after she crossed over the Turkish border to visit a hospital in war-ravaged Syria.\n\nDuring her 18-month captivity, Mueller was taken as a wife by Baghdadi and raped multiple times, according to the testimony of Yazidi sex slaves who say they were kept alongside her. She was also forced to convert to Islam but did not truly accept the religion.\n\nMueller, who was credited for saving the lives of other female captives, was killed in 2015 but her body has never been recovered. After her death was announced in February 2015, her parents journeyed to Irbil to meet with Umm Sayyaf, the wife of high-ranking ISIS oil baron ENTITY.\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, being interviewed by his group's Al-Furqan media outlet, was killed in a US special forces raid in northwestern Syria over the weekend\n\nSatellite image of the residence of the former ISIS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in northwestern Syria near the village of Barisha\n\nCarl Mueller described how 'against the advice of the FBI' they had met Umm Sayyaf, whose husband had previously been killed in a Delta Force strike.\n\n'It makes a big difference when you are talking to these people with a humanitarian attitude,' he told ABC.\n\n'We don't care what you did, what you've done - we just want to know what you know about our daughter to bring her home.\n\n'She was held in many cold, dark places, she was raped by al-Baghdadi, we know that to be a fact ... She was murdered by him or someone in his organization. That's what we're pursuing and that's what we hope that President Trump will help us with.'\n\nThe couple said they were still working with President Trump to try to have their daughter's remains repatriated.\n\n'For me what matters most I'm hoping now we will finally get the answers we have been asking for all along ... I think this administration truly might help us. I don't think they are as closed about what happened,' Marsha Mueller told the Arizona Republic.\n\nTrump announced Sunday morning that Baghdadi 'died like a dog' as the result of a raid on his hideout in northwest Syria.\n\nThe president touted the operation and al-Baghdadi's death as 'bigger than bin Laden'. Osama bin Laden, founder of Al-Qaeda and the terrorist leader behind the September 11 terrorist attacks, was killed in 2011 during a Navy SEALs operation during Barack Obama's presidency.\n\n'This is the biggest there is. This is the worst ever. Osama bin Laden was big, but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center. This is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, a country,' Trump said, referencing Baghdadi's creation of the Islamic State.\n\nTrump also referred to Baghdadi and those who followed him as 'losers,' and lauded that no U.S. personnel were lost during the raid. He did say, however, that one 'talented canine' was injured.\n\n'I got to watch much of it. No personnel were lost in the operation, while a large number of Baghdadi's fighters and companions were killed with him,' Trump said during his rare Sunday morning remarks.\n\n'He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way,' Trump continued, adding that Baghdadi drug three of his children with him.\n\n'They were led to certain death.\n\nCarl and Marsha Mueller, the parents of Kayla Mueller, who was raped and tortured by slain ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, say she could still be alive if Obama had been as decisive as Trump\n\nAl-Baghdadi, the leader of the so-called Islamic caliphate, blew himself up during the targeted attack on his lair in Syria's Idlib province in the early hours of Sunday morning. His lair was in a village known for smuggling, and he arrived there 48 hours before the raid\n\nTrump said, without explanation on Saturday that 'Something very big has just happened!' and the White House confirmed the president would be addressing the nation on Sunday morning\n\n'He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast. the tunnel had caved in on it, in addition. But test results gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification. It was him. The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him,' he said.\n\nInformation is now emerging over how the U.S. was able to track down Baghdadi, including details of his whereabouts from two inside informants.\n\nA senior Iraqi intelligence official told the Associated Press that a few months ago an Iraqi aide to al-Baghdadi was killed in western Iraq by a U.S. airstrike, and his wife was arrested and handed over to Iraqi authorities.\n\nThe official indicated that the wife ended up being a key source of information on Baghdadi's whereabouts. The Iraqis who had her in custody were ultimately able to pass along to the U.S. coordinates on Baghdadi through information they learned from the aide's wife.\n\nA second Iraqi security official said Baghdadi's brother-in-law was recently arrested by the Iraqis and also gave information on Baghdadi's whereabouts\n\nThe ISIS leader's two wives, who were both wearing explosive devices that never detonated, were taken down. Several of his children were taken from the lair and are still alive. Several others were killed in the attack.\n\nTrump said more people were killed than captured, but confirmed there are some in U.S. custody.\n\nKurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) confirmed on Sunday they had worked with the U.S. on a 'successful' operation against Islamic State.\n\n'Our strong and effective operations once again confirm our strength and determination to go after (Islamic State),' the head of the SDF's media office said.\n\nSyrians ride a motorcycle past a burnt vehicle near the site where a helicopter gunfire reportedly killed nine people near the northwestern Syrian village of Barisha\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces is an alliance in the Syrian Civil War made up of primarily Kurdish, Arab and Assyrian/Syriac militias.\n\nSDF General Commander Mazloum Abdi took partial credit for taking down Baghdadi, but also thanked the president and U.S. Army in its efforts, which he said have been under way for almost half-a-year.\n\n'For five months there has been joint intel cooperation on the ground and accurate monitoring, until we achieved a joint operation to kill Abu Bakir al-Baghdadi. Thanks to everybody who participate in this great mission,' Abdi tweeted, tagging Donald Trump's Twitter account.\n\nThe president also thanked those who had assisted in finding Baghdadi, participated in the raid and brought him to his death. He said that while the Kurds provided information that was useful in taking down Baghdadi, they did not assist in the military operations.\n\nThe ISIS leader has been among U.S. and Europe's force's most wanted figures since his chilling call to arms in 2014, which saw a shift away from the mass casualty attacks carried out by al-Qaeda in favor of smaller-scale acts of violence.\n\nShifting away from the airline hijackings and other mass-casualty attacks that came to define al-Qaeda, Baghdadi encouraged smaller-scale acts of violence that would be harder for law enforcement to prepare for and prevent.\n\nHe encouraged jihadists who could not travel to the caliphate to instead kill where they were using whatever weapon they had at their disposal, resulting in a series of devastating attacks in the UK and Europe.\n\nHis words inspired more than 140 terrorist attacks in 29 countries other than Iraq and Syria, resulting in the deaths of at least 2,043 people, CNN reports.\n\nMeeting in the situation room Saturday night (from left to right): National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, Vice President Mike Pence, Trump, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley and Brig. General Marcus Evans\n\nSince 2016, the State Department has offered a reward of up to $25 million for information or intelligence that could lead to Baghdadi's capture or death.\n\nBaghdadi led ISIS for the last five years, presiding over its ascendancy as it cultivated a barbaric reputation for beheadings and horrific executions.\n\nThese recordings, often noted for their high production values, were distributed online along with the ISIS propaganda magazine Dabiq.\n\nHe remained among the few ISIS commanders still at large despite multiple claims in recent years about his death and even as his so-called caliphate dramatically shrank, with many supporters who joined the cause either imprisoned or jailed.\n\nWith a $25 million (£19.5m) bounty on his head, Baghdadi had been far less visible in recent years, releasing only sporadic audio recordings, including one just last month in which he called on members of the extremist group to do all they could to free ISIS detainees and women held in jails and camps.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported an attack carried out by a squadron of eight helicopters accompanied by a warplane.\n\nThe attacks were on positions where ISIS operatives were believed to be hiding in the Barisha area north of Idlib city, after midnight on Saturday-Sunday.\n\nIt said the helicopters targeted ISIS positions with heavy strikes for about 120 minutes, during which jihadists targeted the helicopters with heavy weapons.\n\nReports suggest that al-Baghdadi, the elusive militant who has been the subject of an international manhunt for years, had been killed in Idlib, Syria\n\nThe Syrian Observatory documented the death of nine people as a result of the coalition helicopter attack, adding that the death toll is likely to rise due to the presence of a large number of wounded.\n\nThe strike came amid concerns that a recent American pullback from northeastern Syria could infuse new strength into the militant group, which had lost vast stretches of territory it had once controlled.\n\nThe purported audio was his first public statement since last April, when he appeared in a video for the first time in five years.\n\nIn 2014, he was a black-robed figure delivering a sermon from the pulpit of Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri, his only known public appearance.\n\nHe urged Muslims around the world to swear allegiance to the caliphate and obey him as its leader.\n\n'It is a burden to accept this responsibility to be in charge of you,' he said in the video.\n\n'I am not better than you or more virtuous than you. If you see me on the right path, help me. If you see me on the wrong path, advise me and halt me. And obey me as far as I obey God.'\n\nThe death of such a high-value U.S. target comes amid a difficult political backdrop for Trump, who has been frustrated heavy media focus on the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, which he calls a bipartisan smear.\n\nHe has also faced withering criticism from both Republicans and Democrats alike for his U.S. troop withdrawal from northeastern Syria, which permitted Turkey to attack America's Kurdish allies."
BAYT AL MAQDIS,1,"Reports of a secret war being waged by Hamas against Salafi-jihadist groups in the Gaza Strip are indicative of increasing challenges to the former's security control within the enclave. Recent attacks launched by Salafist cells toward Israel and on Hamas members, including those with purported links to ISIS, impede the fragile ceasefire that exists between Hamas and Israel. Hamas' current approach to violent Salafist cells in Gaza is equally demonstrative of an ongoing warming of relations between Cairo and Hamas, and one that has afforded Hamas international legitimacy and an ease in border restrictions. Aided by Israeli intelligence and military operations, Egypt has been engaged in the largest military campaign in the Sinai since the 1973 war with Israel in an effort to curb ISIS-affiliated militants. The expanded crackdown in the Gaza Strip is thus also meant to provide further confirmation of Hamas' new-found allegiance to Cairo and its definitive break from past collaboration with Sinai-based militant groups.\n\nA delicate status quo\n\nHamas' adoption of a more aggressive attitude toward armed Salafists in the Gaza Strip comes in the wake of attacks on the group's political and military leadership. This summer, suicide bombers believed to be linked to ISIS killed three Hamas police officers in Gaza City. According to Gazan officials, the recent arrest of four Salafist cells disrupted further planned attacks on Hamas security forces and representatives. Salafist factions have also allegedly been responsible for ramping up tensions with Israel, by launching long-range rockets into Israeli territory in defiance of fragile ceasefire agreements between Hamas and Israel. In March 2019, both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) denied responsibility for rockets fired at Tel Aviv -- in spite of reports suggesting that the military capability for such attacks lies exclusively with these two groups. Hamas has, at times, contracted PIJ to hit Israeli target to avoid direct involvement. Nevertheless, Hamas' reported confiscation of long-range rockets held by Salafi cells points to the existence of a sophisticated arsenal of weapons that can reach far into Israeli territory.\n\nThis is not the first time that Hamas has sought to curb violent Salafi-jihadi activities in Gaza. Over the past decade, Hamas has, as Benedatta Berti notes, become more determined in regulating and controlling these groups, mostly as a reaction to the Salafi-jihadis' repeated defiance of the Hamas government. Salafi-jihadi groups, such as Jaysh al-Islam, have emerged in the Palestinian Territories -- and predominately Gaza -- since the mid-2000s, where they have been able to gain strength due to the ongoing power struggle between Fatah and Hamas and capitalize on disgruntlement with Hamas' perceived accommodation with Israel and its gradual approach to Islamization. This latter criticism equally derives from the radical ideology which underlies Salafi-jihadism in Gaza. Similarly to criticism levelled at the wider Muslim Brotherhood movement out of which Hamas emerged, Salafi-jihadi groups denounce pragmatic governance, including electoral participation, and seek a transnational religious dimension to Palestinian resistance that is closer to the rhetoric used by al-Qaeda than armed Palestinian opposition groups such as Hamas.\n\nHamas-Salafi cooperation\n\nDespite diverging ideologies and practices, Hamas has in the past cooperated with Salafi-jihadi groups, including those based in the Sinai Peninsula, in an effort to buoy its Islamist credentials and achieve common objectives. In the aftermath of Mohammed Morsi's ousting and Egypt's subsequent campaign to destroy Hamas' underground tunnel infrastructure, Israeli reports revealed the existence of a transactional relationship between Hamas and ISIS' Sinai branch, Wilayat Sinai (WS). In return for cross-border weapons smuggling through the so-called \Libya Highway\"" and the Sudan route, Hamas is said to have provided critical logistics and military training to WS and its predecessor, Ansar ENTITY, in addition to advanced weapons and medical assistance.\n\nJihadi groups in the Sinai also benefitted from the influx of Gazan fighters, including members of the Jund Ansar Allah movement, which has aided WS in launching a deadly insurgency against the Egyptian regime. The reported reconciliation in 2013 with Salafi groups in the Gaza Strip through the mediation of Kuwaiti and Qatari clerics, too, was attributed to the removal of Muslim Brotherhood leader Morsi and reflected what one Hamas source referred to as a relationship \""based on common local interest that trumps ideology.\"" Still, the then established joint committee evidently failed to solve internal problems and ensure Salafists' adherence to cease-fire agreements with Israel while ensuring Hamas' military superiority.\n\nAn Egyptian-Hamas détente\n\nA warming of ties between Hamas and the Egyptian regime has also proven an obstacle to Salafi-Hamas cooperation. The execution of an alleged Hamas collaborator by ISIS' Sinai branch in 2018, according to the video's narrator, was partly conducted in response to Hamas' crackdown on Islamist militant groups in Gaza and its \""following in the footsteps of the disbelieving West.\"" The coordinated attack by Gazan Salafi-jihadists in an ISIS operation that targeted an Egyptian security checkpoint in July 2017 was similarly attributed to militants' discontent with the growing Egyptian-Hamas rapprochement -- and one that has involved Hamas disclaiming its links to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nThe relationship between Hamas and Egypt has improved markedly since 2017. Beyond functioning as a mediatory between Hamas and Fatah and Hamas and Israel, Egypt is believed to have offered concessions on trade and free movement across the Rafah crossing in return for moves to secure the border -- through the establishment of a buffer zone -- against ISIS fighters. Since May 2018, Egypt has opened the border crossing with Gaza and Hamas delegations visiting Cairo, including those involving Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, have become a common occurrence.\n\nIn a further sign of détente, Hamas recently ordered its supporters to refrain from commenting on ongoing demonstrations against Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi's rule, contrary to its position in 2011, when it welcomed the removal of President Hosni Mubarak and clamped down on pro-Egyptian rallies in Gaza. According to Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassam, this change in position is a consequence of \""the relationship with Egypt [being] at its best and there [being] continuous communication between the Hamas leadership and the leaders in Egypt, and an understanding on bilateral issues such as securing borders and fighting extremism.\""\n\nWith the outside aid upon which the Gaza Strip has depended drying up and an impending humanitarian crisis enveloping the enclave, Hamas might become more willing to concede to Egyptian -- and Israeli -- demands in an attempt to garner developmental support and address criticism of its economic policies. While the majority of Gazans (64 percent) polled in 2018 supported a long-term cessation of violence with Israel that would ease the siege, any perceived political concessions are bound to feed Salafi-jihadi rhetoric. Questions concerning Hamas' commitment to the Palestinian cause thus are likely to fuel further violent challenges to the group's rule and, in turn, test its dedication to pragmatic governance."
ABU AHMED GROUP,0,"November 7, 1975. A unique day in the life of Bangladesh. At the early hours on this day, soldiers in the Dhaka Cantonment came out in force against the conspiratorial putsch staged by Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf' four days earlier. Firing with whatever personal weapons they possessed in all directions, they made it warlike. They chanted self-serving slogans, anti-officer ones being the loudest.\n\n\Being a freedom fighter,\"" said retired General Ibrahim, then a Captain, \""I was used to such firing. But the fireworks I had seen and heard that day was unprecedented.\"" Captain Ashraf of Signal Corps saw the approaching crowd shouting \""Sipai-sipai bhai, officerder rokto chai, Subedarer upore rank nai (soldier-soldier brothers, we seek the blood of officers. No rank above Subedar).\"" He quickly donned uniform, took off his rank badge and joined the crowd slanting slogans against officers. In confusion and in the darkness of the night, nobody identified the badge-less officer. He was not alone. Many officers did the same while some went hiding wherever they could. Colonel Oli ENTITY remained hidden in a paddy field for three days. Nearly two dozen officers lost their lives in the hands of the agitated and unruly troops in Dhaka alone. Another 20 casualties in other cantonments were reported. A batman killed his boss, a lady captain of the medical corps (Batman was a soldier assigned to an officer to take care of the officer's official chores, a British legacy). An angry soldier shot the wife dead when he could not find the Major at the residence. Some soldiers were kinder; they just tore the ranks off the shoulders of the officers whomever they found.\n\nMeanwhile, Major Mohiuddin and Subedar Major Anis of 2 Field Artillery Regiment led a group of their men and rescued General Ziaur Rahman from confinement at his residence, which was nearby. Outnumbered by the storming artillerymen, the guarding soldiers of 1 Bengal Regiment gave away. A reinstated Army Chief made 2 Field his headquarters for the next few\n\ndays. (In the Sylhet warfront in 1971, Captain Rashed Chowdhury founded this artillery unit as part of the Z Force of Colonel Ziaur Rahman. This unit was also in the forefront during the August 15 revolution. Major Mohiuddin was hanged in 2010 for his involvement in the August 15 Coup).\n\nOutside, the soldiers rode tanks and trucks and fanned out to the city. The general public, dismayed at Khaled's betrayal of the August 15 spirit, as well as to the nation-most of them perceived Khaled's was a pro-Indian takeover-joined the troops and paraded the city streets slanting slogans jointly, which included Sipahi-Jonota Bhai (soldiers-public brothers) and praises for President Mustique, General Ziaur Rahman and the heroes of August 15. The event thus came to be known as Sepoy-Jonota Biplop (Soldier-People Revolution). Later termed as the National Revolution and Solidarity Day, or simply National Solidarity Day (NSD), it is observed as such on November 7. It was a national holiday.\n\nHowever, the day's events were not as simple as the eyes and ears caught. A few vested and vicious forces came into play. I will come to that later. The most important thing about NSD is not what happened on that day, it is how such a serious broken discipline and dangerously chaotic situation in the ranks and file were brought under control by General Ziaur Rahman.\n\nLost Vision of NSD\n\nGeneral public attach the Sepoy-Jonota Biplop to the national unity, which was disturbed by Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf's revolt on November 3, 1975. For decades, the day received due importance under different administrations. But not under Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League. To them, it resurrected their nemesis, General Ziaur Rahman, and heralded him to be a great leader in Bangladesh. Zia's successes reminded them of the abject failures of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, their worshiped leader. To demean the importance of NSD, the Hasina administration struck it off the list of national holidays. The day passes unsung under it. It's observance and programs are not only frowned, but at times disbanded or forcibly stopped on various pretext. Sheikh Hasina could not tolerate any program that eulogized Ziaur Rahman. Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of Ziaur Rahman and other non-Awami elements, fearful of the official scowl and restriction, try to observed the day in a low key. In the process, they make a mockery of the significance of the day by shying away from mentioning how November 7 came about in the first place. It is like talking about a child without acknowledging its father. But the people are no fools. They detest such ostrich vision as displayed by today's observers of the NSD.\n\nAs one cannot discuss the independence of Bangladesh without first tracking the independence of India and its partition in 1947, one cannot also talk of National Solidarity without taking into account the November 3 and August 15 ante. The moment we talk of November 7, our immediate attention goes to November 3. And, November 3 takes us to August 15, 1975.\n\nWhat Happened on November 3\n\nOn the night of November 2, 1975, Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf, Army's Chief of the General Staff, arrested Army Chief General Ziaur Rahman and declared himself the new Chief of Army Staff. Next day, he promoted himself to a Major General. On November 5, public were entertained with a front-page image in most dailies, in which the chiefs of the Navy and the Air Force gleefully helping a beaming Khaled with his general's badge.\n\nKhaled and his cohorts tried to tell those willing to listen that their action was to restore \""the chain of command\"" that was broken on August 15, 1975. Far from convincing. On August 15, a group of young army officers brought an end to the repressive and dictatorial one-party BAKSAL (Bangladesh Krishok Sramik Awami League) regime of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to the great relief and joy of Bangladeshis. Within hours, service chiefs and Khaled Mosharraf rushed to the Radio Station to express their support and solidarity with the August 15 action.\n\nThe self-styled army chief (Khaled) demanded that President Khandakar Mushtaque ENTITY step down and turn over the August 15 officers to him. Khaled's intention was no secret to Bangabhaban, the presidential palace. He wanted to rid of those Majors who had become obstacles to his personal ambition. The president and the officers refused to comply.\n\nA power struggle ensued between Bangabhaban and Khaled's headquarters at 4 Bengal in the Dhaka cantonment. (4 Bengal was part of his K Force in the liberation war and he commanded its loyalty. But its Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Aminul Haq was a Zia loyalist. Amin was sidelined during Khaled's plan and operation). President Mushtaque, General M A G Osmany, president's Defense Adviser, and the young officers of August 15 showed great courage, prudence and restraint, even in the face of serious insolence and heightened provocations by Khaled and his cohorts.\n\nGeneral Mohammad Ataul Gani Osmany, the Chief of Mukti Bahini in 1971 and Defense Advisor to President Mushtaque ENTITY\n\nMercifully, the public life had not been disturbed. People continued their business as usual, mostly oblivious of what had been going between Khaled and Mushtaque. The most ominous lapse, however, was the total silence of the electronic media-radio and television-for almost three days, generating umpteen rumors and premonitions among the citizenry.\n\nWhy Khaled Did It\n\nKhaled Mosharraf was one of Bangladesh's brightest officers. He made glorious contributions during the liberation war in 1971. He was wounded during the closing days of the war. To say he was ambitious would not be enough. He was overambitious and could go to any lengths to fulfill his objectives.\n\n(During the war, Khaled was the Commander of Number 2 Sector, responsible for Comilla, Dhaka and part of Noakhali districts. His tactical headquarters was based close to India's eastern city of Agartala, the second most important center, after Kolkata, of the military and political activities of Bangladesh. Khaled used public relations to the fullest to augment his image by frequently inviting reporters to his headquarters. Few other commanders had the time, opportunity and interest to do so.\n\nIn July 1971, the Mukti Bahini Headquarters at Mujibnagar decided to form two conventional army brigades -- Z Force, to be commanded by Ziaur Rahman, and S Force, to be commanded by K M Safiullah- with the nuclei composed of former military personnel with superior armaments. Khaled moved heaven and earth to have a third brigade, K Force, for himself. That speaks of his ambition and how haste he was in to reach his goal.)\n\nKhaled perhaps could have reached any height he desired in the national hierarchy, had he waited for his turn. But he was impatient. He developed a personal rapport with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through his younger brother Rashed Mosharraf, an Awami League Member of the Parliament. Reportedly, he even made an overture to Sheikh Mujib, to appoint him the army chief, superseding his seniors Ziaur Rahman, Safiullah and many others.\n\nAfter the August 15, 1975 revolution, Khaled Mosharraf was the first senior officer to react positively. He came forward to help the young officers consolidate their success. He was a regular visitor to the Bangabhaban and tried to befriend the young Majors, and posed as their greatest supporter and well-wisher. Obviously, he eyed a leadership position within and outside the group, including perhaps the coveted post of the army chief, before it went to anyone else. He knew Safiullah's days as the army chief were coming to an end. But the young officers knew better.\n\nZia Honored\n\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman could not digest the fact that an unknown Major Ziaur Rahman had the \""audacity\"" to declare the Independence of Bangladesh on March 27, 1975 and stole the show. This was a task Mujib ought to have done but failed, which true to his characteristics, did not have the integrity to own. Instead, a few fake stories were released in the market to the effect that Mujib made the declaration before his arrest or surrender. None of those stories sustained because of serious inconsistencies. It has later been revealed that Mujib had no plan for an independent Bangladesh. He eyed the premiership in Islamabad while obtaining full autonomy for East Pakistan.\n\nAs a punishment to Zia, Mujib made his junior K M Safiullah the army chief. But Zia was too popular in the army to be sidelined. His peers and juniors both feared him and respected him for his honesty, discipline, assertiveness and effectiveness. Noting the consequent displeasure in the military hierarchy, a new post of Deputy Chief of Army Staff (DCAS) was created and Zia was accommodated there. Most people in the military knew that Safiullah was the titular head while the real command rested with Ziaur Rahman. He handled all matters relating to organization, administration, operation and technical. As a Staff Officer in one of the formations those days, I had seen the formation commanders would invariably endorse a copy of their letters meant for the Army Headquarters to the DCAS for immediate compliance. Ziaur Rahman became a legend, an icon but I never saw him showing it off. (Having served as one of his unit commanders in the war, I had maintained personal relationship with him even though our positions were miles apart.)\n\nThe August 15 officers thought it was time to recognize Zia's seniority, competence and his contribution to the independence of Bangladesh. On their recommendation, Ziaur Rahman was made the new army chief. Air Vice Marshal AK Khandakar was replaced by Group Captain Tawab, an efficient officer, who had gone on self-retirement in Germany since 1971. He was promoted to Air Vice Marshal. The replaced officers-Safiullah and Khandakar-were sent abroad as ambassadors.\n\nThe Conspiratorial Putsch\n\nLosing his bet with the August 15 officers, Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf devised his counter coup to satisfy his ambition and ego. Some senior officers felt dwarfed by the August 15 officers who achieved a spectacular success that the whole country welcomed. \""Missing the boat,\"" those peeved officers wanted to do something to outdo the August 15, and they bonded with Khaled Mosharraf. Brigadier Rouf, Director-General of the Defence Forces, Colonel Malek, Director of Military Operations, Colonel Shafaat Jamil, Commander of Dhaka's 46 Brigade, also joined in the conspiracy. Shafaat had four Infantry Battalions under his command: 1, 2, 4 and 22 Bengals. Lieutenant Colonels Matiur Rahman, Azizur Rahman, Aminul Haq and Abdul Ghaffar Hawladar commanded the four units respectively. Shafaat could not trust Artillery, Armour, Engineer and other service units of his Brigade. There was another reason for the desperation of these senior lots.\n\nKhaled learned that he topped the list of about 30 officers to be purged soon on various grounds. Ziaur Rahman was not involved in the preparation of the list but was kept in picture. Considering possible repercussion in hostile quarters, he went slow on the cleansing matter pending further scrutiny and advised the president accordingly. Most officers who joined Khaled belonged to that list. For them, it was now or never. The result was the November 3, 1975 putsch. Zia became the first victim.\n\nThe conspirators failed to enlist the support of most military establishments inside and outside Dhaka. Men outside their orbit could not accept Khaled's action aimed at negating the success of August 15. They also could not approve of the arrest of General Ziaur Rahman, the most popular officer at the time. Khaled relied on whatever loyal elements he could muster. He ordered 10 Bengal, another of his wartime K Force units, to move from Jessore to Dhaka. Upon arrival on November 5, it camped at the Parliament area at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar in the city. Thus, scope of his activity and support was limited. He thought if he could seize control of the Bangabhaban, the rest will fall in line. It didn't work.\n\nDuring the early hours of November 3, 1975, elements of 2, 4 and 22 Bengal quietly left the Dhaka cantonment and deployed themselves at a few strategic points that included the main thoroughfares connecting the capital with the rest of the country. Major Hafiz, Brigade Major of Shafaat's 46 Brigade, played a key role in executing Khaled's plan. (In end March 1971, Hafiz defected with parts of 1 Bengal that was deployed outside Jessore. In July, 1 Bengal re-grouped in Mymensingh and joined the Z Force. The unit was loyal to both Zia and Hafiz and was in a crossroad on November 3).1 Bengal was then guarding the Bangabhaban. Hafiz sent a message to the troops at Bangabhabon to leave the place. Captain Iqbal, Hafiz's brother-in-law, who commanded the guard detachment in Bangabhaban, readily complied. But all the troops did not obey Hafiz or Iqbal. A platoon or so still remained inside and closely guarded the president and his team. Later, elements of 2 and 22 Bengal arrived, but were not allowed in and they positioned themselves outside the perimeter. Apparently, acknowledging the shortage of his troop strength, Khaled had strict instructions not to enter into any direct confrontation with opposing forces.\n\nHafiz also said to have arranged the house arrest of Ziaur Rahman with 1 Bengal soldiers. But he was a Zia loyalist too. Reportedly, he visited the Zia family regularly during those crucial days and ensured that no harm was done to anyone. Squadron Leader Liaquat made an air show over Dhaka with a MiG-19 in solidarity with Khaled. Flight Lieutenant Iqbal Rashid and Shamsher, made a few helicopter rounds over the Bangabhaban. However, no untoward incident was reported, other than generating various rumors in public minds.\n\nAugust 15 Officers Leave Country\n\n(This is from an officer involved in August 15 Action)\n\nAt one stage, Mushtaque offered to leave the country temporarily for Khaled and Majors to sort their business. Colonels Rashid, Farook and Dalim, who had since been promoted, decided to join the president. They feared that once Khaled took control, they would be made scapegoats and face the consequences. One by one, other officers and their families also joined the bandwagon. Finally, it was decided that only the officers would leave the country, the president needed not. Mushtaque opted out.\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs frantically looked for a suitable country which would give temporary shelter to the officers. Finally, a positive response came from Thailand. A Bangladesh Biman Fokker Friendship plane was made ready to fly to Bangkok. Brigadier Mashhoor ul- Haque, the Military Secretary to the President, issued temporary Identity Cards to the officers and their family members, in absence of passports. Around 10 pm, the officers and their families were escorted to the airport. All the valuable possessions of the officers, including cash whoever had, were confiscated. Some officers had small firearms which were also taken. Lieutenant Colonel Aminul Haq, was in charge of the security clearance at the airport. \""Why are you leaving?\"" he asked an officer with whom he fought the war together and were close. \""You have no problem. It is Rashid and Farook, if any.\"" The officer was hesitant, but his batch mate and friend Major Mahbubur Rahman of the Military Intelligence, who was also at the airport, cautioned that if he stayed in the country, he could face trouble with Khaled and Co. The officer knew Mahbub was loyal to Khaled and had inside information. He took Mahbub's advice and boarded the plane with wife and their 18-month old son.\n\nAround midnight on November 3, the Fokker left Dhaka. Most officers had no idea where they headed. After a short time, it landed in Chittagong, said to be for refueling. Soldiers from local formation kept the plane cordoned. No one was allowed to leave the plane. Those inside were keeping their fingers crossed, some reciting Quranic verses assuming their doom was close. It was a scary syndrome!\n\n\""Through the window, I saw Brigadier Atiqur Rahman, the local area commander and Captain Wali, an officer with whom I fought the war,\"" said the officer of the group. \""I knew them personally. Wali and his newly married wife were close to my family when we served together in Chittagong after the war. When he saw me and my wife, he waved to us with a thumb up, signaling everything was okay. I felt confident.\"" After about an hour, which seemed too long, the plane took off. It landed at Bangkok during the early hours of the morning on November 4. \""It was the longest night,\"" recalled the officer. \""We were still confined inside the plane which was parked in an isolated place away from the tarmac with no electric connection. As sun rose high, so did the Bangkok temperature and the children kept screaming in heat and discomfort. Around 10 am, we disembarked and went to the tarmac building. Another wait till late afternoon. Meanwhile, Bangladesh Embassy people came, brought food and drinks and milk for the children. Everyone was issued with a passport \""Valid for Travel to the Kingdom of Thailand Only.\"" Temporary IDs were taken away.\n\nAfter completion of immigration formalities, we were taken to a mid-level Victoria Hotel on Silom Road. We received one hundred Thai Baht, about $4, per family per day for our subsistence. On November 7, our allowance was raised to 100 Baht per person. That was a relief and we could save some money to buy a few essentials. Our passports were re-endorsed to 'Valid for All Countries of the World, except Israel and South Africa.'\""\n\nColonel Nazmul Huda (an Agartala Conspiracy Case officer, hence had a personal loyalty to Sheikh Mujib. A nice person otherwise) rushed in from Bogra to help Khaled. Upon arrival in Dhaka, his first query was the whereabouts of the August 15 officers. When he learned that they had left the country, he immediately contacted the Dhaka Airport Control Tower and asked them to bring the plane back to Dhaka. \""It cannot be done, Sir,\"" replied the Air Controller. \""The plane is outside our airspace.\"" A tower officer later confided to another officer of the group that, in reality, at that moment, the plane was readying to take off from Chittagong. They let it go. Colonel Huda then contacted Brigadier Atiq in Chittagong and received the same response.\n\nMustaque's Resignation\n\nAfter the August 15 officers left the country on the night of November 3, Khaled offered Mushtaque to continue as president while he ran the show. It did not work. \""If I am to stay as president,\"" Mushtaque reportedly replied, \""I will be the President, not your President.\"" Brigadier Rouf and Colonel Malek went to Bangabhabon on behalf of Khaled on November 4 and 5 and unsuccessfully tried to persuade the stubborn president to resign. Later, an infuriated Colonel Shafaat took a platoon of armed soldiers and stormed the president's office and forced him to sign the resignation in presence of General Osmany on November 5. He said to have applied physical force on the elderly leaders. Shafaat, an honest and decorated freedom fighter, was politically close to Awami ideology, though he had a personal loyalty to Ziaur Rahman. He commanded 3 Bengal, one of the component units of Z Force during the war. On November 6, Chief Justice of Bangladesh, ASM Sayem, was made the new president. Mushtaque cabinet stood dissolved and the constitution suspended with the declaration of a renewed Martial Law under Khaled.\n\nClearly, the November 3 conspiracy was aimed at undoing the August 15 revolution. Opportunists in the disgraced Awami League came forward to lend support to Khaled and his cohorts. Bangladesh Intelligence arrested a few agents, identified as Indians, in Dhaka and elsewhere while they were distributing leaflets in support of Khaled. Lawrence Lifschultz, a left leaning American journalist, asserts of an Indian hand in Khaled's attempted takeover. \""Before news of the jail house murders became public on November 5th,\"" Lifschultz writes in Bangladesh: The Unfinished Revolution, p-7 (Zed Press London, 1979) \""the official Indian radio and strictly censored press greeted this second putsch with such unrestrained pleasure that few observers failed to suspect India's covert hand.\""\n\nOn November 4, Rashed Mosharraf, Khaled's brother, and their mother led a small protest march against the \""killing\"" of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to his residence at 32 Dhanmodi. They chanted slogans in favor of Khaled's coup and friendship with India. Their action did not receive much public enthusiasm and it soon died. But it had big impact on Khaled's coup. The news was flashed in most dailies the next day and the people took it granted that Khaled was an Indian agent. When Khaled learned about it, he called his mother. \""You just dug my grave, Ma,\"" Khaled moaned. Khaled was not known to be pro-Indian.\n\nJail Killing\n\nAn unfortunate incident happened on the night of November 3, 1975. A few armed soldiers entered the Dhaka Central Jail and killed four top leaders of Awami League who were in custody there. Former Vice President Syed Nazrul Islam, former Secretary General of Awami League and wartime Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmad, former Minister Mansur Ali and former Minister Qamaruzzaman were gunned down at close range. The Jail Killing episode remained shrouded in mystery and no proper investigation to the incident was carried out for a long time. Exact time of the incident has not yet been established or revealed. After more than two decades, the Hasina administration held a trial, which convicted, among others, Mushtaque-by then dead- and most of the August 15 Coup leaders. Like the Mujib Murder case, the Jail Killing was also handled in a highly political light and there existed glaring discrepancies in the investigation. It ignored the fact that the officers were out of the scene, in fact out of the country, when the incident reported to have taken place. According to investigation report, the jail authority had received a call, supposedly from the office of the president, to allow the armed soldiers inside the jail. Most analysts point fingers at Mushtaque for the gruesome act.\n\nKhaled Miscalculated the Impact of August 15\n\nThe young officers of August 15 could have easily taken on Khaled and his co-conspirators. They had the support of the troops, the majority of officers and the public at large. Most importantly, they had command of the formidable tanks and artillery guns. On the other hand, Khaled had virtually no troops with him. Infantry troops of Dhaka Brigade-1, 2, 4 and 22 Bengal-which Shafaat banked on, had divided loyalty (During the sepoy uprising on November 7, soldiers of these units also participated). President Mushtaque and General Osmany prevailed on the young officers. They did not want the onset of a civil war because of a \""stupid action\"" of Khaled, nor did they want to see any renewed bloodshed in the country. August 15 officers were persuaded to leave the country for the time being, to be brought back after the dust settled. Most importantly, the Bangabhaban leaders did not want to present a pretext to India to intervene.\n\nKhaled and his cronies miscalculated the victory and the impact of August 15. They forgot the public joy and celebration following the fall of Sheikh Mujib, and ignored how people from every walk of life came forward to welcome the August 15 revolution, hailing it as a Day of Deliverance, and how quickly the foreign governments recognized the follow-up administration under Mushtaque. They overlooked the peoples' overall satisfaction at the tremendous success achieved by the new administration in such a short time.\n\nTaher's Vicious Game\n\nAs mentioned earlier, various groups came into play in the November 7 uprising.\n\nA clandestine organization styled as Biplobi Soinik Sangstha (Revolutionary Soldiers' Organization, BSS) was in the offing in some units of the Dhaka Cantonment. It was the brainchild of Colonel ENTITY Taher, a decorated freedom fighter, who lost a leg in the war. He was released on medical ground and made chief of the Sea Truck Division of the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) at Narayanganj, east of Dhaka. A highly spirited officer, Taher was not to remain quiet or passive. He secretly joined the Marxist party of Jatiyo Samajtantric Dal (JSD) formed by ASM Abdur Rob and Major M A Jalil. A US trained commando, Taher was in charge of the underground militant faction of the party. Hasanul Haq Inu was his deputy. Through his links in the military, he tried to indoctrinate radical JSD ideology among a few chosen officers and some members in the ranks and files. Taher fought in Mymensingh area, in conjunction with Kader Siddiqui. His main target was the remnants of those freedom fighters who later formed the Rakkhi Bahini. The Rakkhi Bahini, dissolved in post-August 15, was absorbed in various units. Taher also had some followers in the Armour and Engineers. BSS took roots with the formation of a few secret cells. The main montro of its Twelve Demands was that Bangladesh would have a Biplobi Gono Bahin (Peoples' Revolutionary Army-PRA), a class-less (officer-less) military and removal of the colonial era discriminatory practices, such as Batman system. PRA was the JSD's version of Chinese Peoples' Army. Secret outfits of the BSS were in their embryonic state.\n\nJSD said to have its own plan to remove Sheikh Mujib and his BAKSAL. It was to be achieved through a nationwide popular uprising. Though it has started some propaganda works at various levels but the people were not yet ready for such radical programs. The August 15 surgical operation and its wide acceptance by the people threw them out of the plank. Some JSD leaders thought August 15 hijacked their objective.\n\nNot to be given up, Colonel Taher quickly extended his support to the August 15 group and was seen hobnobbing around the officers. He was even seen at the Mushtaque's cabinet swearing in at Bangabhaban. He insisted that Mujib's dead body should not be buried anywhere in the country; it could turn out a BAKSALi rallying point in future. He suggested that the body be thrown in the Bay of Bengal. Mujib rests at his village home in Tungipara, Faridpur. Not finding much cordiality among the August 15 officers, Taher went to concentrate on his militant plan through the BSS. Khaled's counter coup, and the general disapproval to it by the military as well as by the public presented a renewed opportunity to him.\n\nDiscipline Restored\n\nTaher came up with his 12-Point Demands, including removal of officer class. Lifschultz claims that Taher wanted to use the image of Ziaur Rahman for his uprising. His soldiers would accept only Zia. But the general was not to be sold. In a meeting of soldiers to present their demands to General Ziaur Rahman on November 8, the representative of the soldiers addressed him as Ziaur Rahman Saheb. Zia immediately and firmly corrected him saying, \""I am General Ziaur Rahman.\"" The speaker got a jolt and corrected his statement. It needed guts to challenge the agitated troops in that situation. But Zia did. Later, he addressed the troops in another gathering and asked them to surrender their weapons before he could consider their demands. \""Those who refuse,\"" Zia said in a stern tone, \""will be arrested.\"" Nobody dared to challenge Ziaur Rahman. To help him in the task, Zia recalled Brigadier M A Manzur from New Delhi, where he was the Defense Adviser in the Bangladesh High Commission, and made him the Chief of the General Staff. The discipline restored in the ranks slowly.\n\nWithin the military, there existed another closely guarded loose organization which called itself Bangladesh Sena Parishod (BSP). Its facade seemed welfare oriented and said to have a few serving and retired officers in its fold. It also claimed that some senior officers, including Ziaur Rahman, were in the know of it. If any, it was also in its infancy. Taher's Biplobi Songstha attempted to link up with the Senal Parishod and influence it with its radical ideas. Taher might have some converts but I doubt if it made any headway or created much impact, because the larger part of the military still remained disciplined and loyal to the command structure. These clandestine cells were weak and remained confined within a few non-fighting units like Signal, Ordnance and Supply. It may have infiltrated in the Engineer and Armour units in Dhaka too. Subsequent developments demonstrated that there existed some unity among troops of all units on the reform and welfare demands contained in the 12 Points. Colonel Shariful Haq Dalim, one of the August 15 leaders, claimed in his book Untold Facts that the August Coup was initiated by the BSP, that is Sena Parishod. I find it difficult to accept. An idea and operation to the magnitude, importance and precision of the August 15 could not have come from the brains a few non-descript officials. The architects of the August 15 plan, Khandakar Abdur Rashid and Farook Rahman, were never known to have any connection with the so called Sena Paarshod.\n\nKhaled's counter coup and arrest of Ziaur Rahman did not go well among the troops. Most officers also did not approve of it. Taking advantage of a general dissatisfaction among soldiers, elements of BSS and BPS contacted like-minded colleagues to initiate an uprising to undo Khaled's putsch and to realize their 12-Point demands. The idea appealed to most troops and they decided to act at the midnight of November 6. Common soldiers were largely oblivious of the BSS or BSP, much less their ideologies but they seemed united on their demands that included 'no officer class in the military.' But they seemed to accept only one officer: General Ziaur Rahman. Once started, soldiers' reaction was instantaneous and the Biplob spread like wild fire and fanned out to almost all units. In absence of a controlling body, it soon went out of control. Wild soldiers made the sky ablaze with small arms fires, as in a closely fought war. Their immediate objectives were Soldiers' Empowerment, oust Khaled and reinstate Zia. General Zia was rescued by 2 Field men and reinstated in authority in their unit. Few of those artillery soldiers had any connection with the radical elements.\n\nTaher Lost the Gamble\n\nColonel Taher was not ready for it. He had worked on a plan which did not mature yet. And, I doubt if he had any plan to rescue Zia even though Lifschultz claims so. The uncontrolled "
ABU AHMED GROUP,0,"State Department Official Demanded Kurds Capitulate to Islamists\n\nFirst, the United States agreed to withdraw special operations forces from a section of northeastern Syria, opening the door to a Turkish invasion aimed at U.S.-allied Kurdish, Arab and Syriac Christian forces there who played a key role in defeating ISIS.\n\nNow, the State Department is demanding that those vulnerable Kurds work with Islamist forces who support the very Turkish onslaught that places them in harm's way.\n\nA top State Department official made the demand last week during a meeting with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Council (SDC) leaders, said an SDC source who was present. The Kurds were told to capitulate politically to the Muslim Brotherhood-dominated National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces (ETILAF).\n\nThat means the Kurds will not get any say in negotiations over Syria's future, but Islamists will.\n\nETILAF is based in Istanbul and closely follows the Turkish party line, including endorsing Turkey's invasion which aims to ethnically cleanse Kurds from a swath of northern Syria. It is dominated by members of Syria's Muslim Brotherhood who support a theocratic future for Syria, and have supported al-Qaida-aligned jihadists in Syria.\n\nPresident Obama recognized ETILAF as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people in 2012 even though it controls no ground in Syria. In contrast, the SDC controlled a third of Syria's territory prior to Turkey's invasion two weeks ago.\n\nIn supporting the Turkish assault, ETILAF cited \the transnational terrorism organizations which make of [sic] these areas a haven for spreading chaos, violence and terrorism,\"" in a press release about the invasion. \""The Coalition also supports the [Syrian] National Army, the Ministry of Defense and the Chief of Staff in their efforts. Syria is a platform to threaten the security and stability of Syrians and neighboring countries.\""\n\nAn Oct. 15 meeting at the State Department between Joel Rayburn, the U.S. Syria envoy, and SDC officials quickly grew heated over the U.S. direction that the Kurds work with the same people supporting Turkey's assault on them. Rayburn angrily broke a pencil in the face of SDC President Ilham ENTITY's translator after the SDC representatives reminded him of a 2016 incident when U.S. Special Forces had tried joining the fight alongside the ETILAF-supported Free Syrian Army (FSA).\n\nThese FSA fighters had threatened to kill them and shouted \""Death to America\"" at them.\n\nThe SDC members also told the State Department official they would not work with the Islamist-dominated group because they could not be trusted.\n\nState Department officials declined to comment about the meeting.\n\nDespite U.S. policies, the SDC's military arm, the Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF), continued to demonstrate its worth as an American ally when intelligence it provided helped make possible Saturday's special forces raid that killed self-appointed ISIS Caliph ENTITY Bakr al-Baghdadi. SDF spies worked with the CIA since May to track Baghdadi's movements, tracking him down to a house near the Turkish-controlled town of Jarablus, Syria, Polat Can, a top SDF adviser wrote on Twitter. They got so close that they were able to steal a pair of Baghdadi's underwear to verify his DNA.\n\n\""You don't sell out an ally like that, my God,\"" said Anne Speckhard, director of the International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism (ICSVE).\n\nSpeckhard spent considerable time in northeastern Syria getting to know ENTITY and members of the YPG/YPJ Kurdish militia, which Turkey considers part of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Turkey's contention that the militia and the PKK are the same organization and that it poses a threat to the Turks is false.\n\n\""I've worked with those YPG people; they're amazing,\"" Speckhard said. \""Anyone who can manage to put together a government that acts and looks like a democracy in the Middle East on the ashes of ISIS should be congratulated and win the Nobel Prize.\""\n\nRecent decisions have left that work in ruins.\n\nThe source from the State Department meeting named three people with Muslim Brotherhood ties with whom Rayburn demanded the SDC cooperate. They are former ETILAF President Anas al-Abdeh, former Syrian National Council President Mouaz al-Khatib and former Syrian National Council member Hassan Hachimi. All three have made public statements supportive of al-Qaida terrorists.\n\nAl-Abdeh told London-based Al-Hayat in 2016 that the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and al-Qaida-linked Jabhat al-Nusra were \""all in the same trench.\""\n\n\""We cannot differentiate between fighters,\"" al-Abdeh said.\n\nHe also opposed the Obama administration's decision in 2015 to partner with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to oust ISIS from its self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa. SDF forces lost 11,000 lives fighting to defeat al-Qaida and ISIS.\n\nHachimi and al-Khatib each made statements in late 2012 that condemned the Obama administration for declaring Jabhat al-Nusra as a terrorist organization.\n\nSpeckard's primary work involved interviewing ISIS prisoners held by the SDF.\n\n\""Everybody knows when taking a look into it that Turkey was arming ISIS and helping ISIS to fight the Kurds,\"" Speckhard said. \""That went on for years, and Turkey also let 40,000 foreign fighters stream through; they let the wounded come to be treated. Now they are back at it.\""\n\nETILAF's \""Prime Minister\"" Abdul Rahman Mustafa toured the border town of Tal Abayad on Thursday, a week after evidence showed the Turkish military using incendiary white phosphorus munitions against civilians. Mustafa also toured the headquarters of the \""Syrian National Army\"" (SNA) Third Legion. Top SNA commander Maj. Gen. Selim Idris, who endorsed al-Qaida's Syrian affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra in 2015, accompanied Mustafa on the visit. The SNA previously was known as the Free Syrian Army (FSA).\n\nThe Third Legion includes Jabhat al-Shamiya, a jihadist group considered a terrorist organization by the Dutch government. It seized homes from Christians in the town, according to an Arab news correspondent who took photos and posted them online. The legion also recently was responsible for the brutal murder and beheading of Hevrin Khalaf, a prominent Kurdish politician, early in the invasion.\n\nVideo showed another element of the Third Corps, Faylaq al-Majd, known in English as the Glory Corps, mutilating the body of a dead female Kurdish fighter.\n\nETILAF also showed its unreliability when weapons the Obama administration supplied to FSA-umbrella groups found their way into the hands of the al-Qaida affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra and ISIS.\n\nDue to last week's agreement between Turkey and Russia, an approximately 20-mile \""safe zone\"" has been imposed along the border between Syria and Turkey. The SDF was required to withdraw from the zone.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan acknowledged his desire to ethnically cleanse his 20-mile wide security zone along Turkey's border with Syria, replacing Kurds with Arabs.\n\n\""The most suitable for this area are Arabs. These areas are not suitable for the lifestyle of Kurds. Because these are virtually desert regions,\"" Erdogan told the Turkish state TV channel TRT.\n\nSo far, a supposed cease-fire Turkey agreed to has not held, despite President Trump's decision to remove economic sanctions against Turkey.\n\nSources in Syria told Speckhard on Thursday that Turkish drones continue to attack Kurdish targets and bombs continue to fall.

ABU AHMED GROUP,0,"For five years, Shorashim has facilitated meetings between Israeli settlers and Palestinians from nearby communities.\n\nPalestinian and Israeli women who took part in the Roots women's photography workshop plant a tree. (photo credit: SASKIA KEELEY)\n\nFor anyone who has lived in this country, whether Arab or Jew, the scene in the Gush Etzion region in the West Bank mid-September would have seemed nearly surrealistic. A dozen young men from a nearby yeshiva were sitting in a circle together with young Palestinian men, drinking coffee and chatting. Leading the discussion were several adults - Jewish religious settlers and devout Muslim Palestinians from neighboring towns.\n\nThe site of the gathering was a well-hidden Palestinian-owned plot of land off the main Route 60 artery and the home of a remarkable grassroots organization called Roots - Shorashim in Hebrew, Judur in Arabic. Since 2014, the not-for-profit group has facilitated interactions between Israeli Jewish settlers and Palestinians from nearby towns. They may be neighbors, but they live in parallel universes that rarely if ever cross.\n\nRoots, say the founders, was created to provide a safe space where Israelis and Palestinians could begin to understand each other's identity and daily struggles in the conflict, and \seek a path of partnership.\""\n\nIn addition to interreligious meetings for adults and youth, Roots organizes a range of activities for Israeli and Palestinian residents, including women's photography workshops, summer camps and break-fasts around religious holidays, and a summer camp for children.\n\nRoots also carries out solidarity visits to victims of violence both Palestinian and Israeli, has worked with Palestinian farmers to gain access to their farmlands adjacent to Jewish settlements, and carried out joint charity initiatives including a blood drive.\n\nThe 19-year-old Jewish participants in the meeting this particular evening are students at the nearby Machanaim Hesder Yeshiva near the town of Efrat. Machanaim is a post high-school institution that combines religious studies with service in the Israel Defense Forces. A month earlier one of their classmates, Dvir Sorek, was stabbed to death as he was returning to the yeshiva from Jerusalem. [Two Palestinian suspects have been charged with the murder.]\n\nDvir had been a member of Roots. In the wake of his murder, Palestinians in the interfaith dialogue group wrote an unprecedented condolence letter to Sorek's family and classmates expressing their shock and horror. \""As a group we condemn such brutal actions; such violence hurts all of us,\"" the letter stated. \""We build bridges between the peoples on this land and we hope that this tragedy will be the last.\""\n\nSINCE ITS founding, thousands of young Israelis have visited Roots' little oasis, many of them hearing for the first time Palestinians' views. None of Sorek's Yeshiva classmates who came to September's gathering had ever personally met any Palestinians before, and most had never heard of Roots until Sorek's death.\n\nThe \""moderators\"" of the meeting were the Roots project co-directors, Rabbi Shaul Judelman, who lives in the settlement of Tekoa, and Khaled ENTITY Awwad from the Palestinian town of Beit Ummar. A small compound has been erected on the three-dunam plot of land serving as Roots' home base. What members call \""The Field,\"" the name of a 2017 documentary on the project, or \""Ard\"" - \""the land\"" - belongs to the ENTITY Awwad family, whose members are well-known Palestinian activists with status as genuine patriots and freedom fighters.\n\nTheir mother, Fatma, was jailed by Israel for her activities in the PLO. Khaled ENTITY Awwad's brother Ali spent time in jail during the First Intifada. Another brother was shot dead by Israeli soldiers under circumstances that are still contested.\n\nAli evolved into a champion of non-violence, and was one of the founders of Roots. Khaled, one of the heads of the Israeli Palestinian Bereaved Families Forum, was awarded a UNESCO prize in 2011 for \""his efforts to promote tolerance, peace and non-violence through his work as a peace activist and leader in the reconciliation process between Palestinians and Israelis.\""\n\nRoots co-director Judelman says he believes that the organization and other movements can point the way to a model for \""more creative political solutions than just the one-state or two-state paradigm.\""\n\n\""Dvir was one of our children,\"" ENTITY Awwad said to the Yeshiva students at the September gathering. \""The murder harmed all of us. I hope this is the beginning of a continuation between us in the name of all those who lost their lives because of the hatred and the fear here. We were born here and will continue to live here, and all the violence doesn't give us anything, only pain and suffering.\""\n\nMousa Sabateen, a tour guide from Bethlehem, told the visitors: \""Once we started meeting at Roots I saw that we were all human beings. We don't want a war; we want to be with you together.\""\n\nSabateen, who had initiated the condolence letter, told them about another Palestinian member of Roots, 28-year-old ENTITY Benasra from the village of Wadi Fukin, who was shot to death by Israeli soldiers in March while trying to help a Palestinian family trapped in a car after an accident. Sabateen said it had been hard to convince Benasra to join the group because he was afraid of the settlers, but in the end found it a positive experience. \""Till now no one has written about this, people only ask me about Dvir,\"" Sabateen added. None of the yeshiva students had heard about Benasra's death.\n\nThe discussion continued in three smaller mixed groups of Palestinians and Israelis. \""My group discussed the issue of fear,\"" recalls Nitzan Fensterheim, one of Dvir's classmates. \""Both sides said they were afraid, but there was a difference in the type of fears we experienced.\""\n\nFensterheim, who grew up in Ra'anana, told The Jerusalem Report that this was the first time he had had any experience with Roots. He said the students compared notes after the meeting.\n\n\""We each took away something different,\"" said Fensterheim. \""I saw the difference between what you hear on the news and what the Palestinians themselves actually go through. For example, for me it was interesting that a lot of the Palestinians there were more interested in day to day safety than grand ideas of nationalism or statehood or where the borders should be drawn.\"" Fensterheim said he found the conversation \""eye-opening. It was actually a relief from how relations between Israelis and Palestinians are portrayed in the media.\""\n\nThese Yeshiva students will be going into the army in March, and it's entirely possible that the same Palestinians in the discussion group will be meeting them armed and in uniform at a checkpoint in the future. \""This probably went through the minds of everyone there, but it went entirely unsaid,\"" Fensterheim admitted. \""It was a fact no one cared to comment on.\""\n\nThe Jewish members of Roots may face criticism or ridicule from their fellow Israelis, but Palestinians take a far greater risk in meeting with Israelis, especially with Jewish settlers. Many do not want to be identified because they could lose their jobs. Khaled is sometimes accused of \""normalization,\"" considered a curse in Palestinian society. This has not deterred him or his family.\n\nThe Jewish activists in Roots/Shorashim/Judur include many disciples of the late Rabbi Menachem Froman from the settlement of Tekoa, a legendary activist in interfaith and peacemaking efforts. He penned the maxim \""the land does not belong to Israelis and Palestinians, but rather, Israelis and Palestinians belong to the land.\""\n\n\""I accompanied Menachem for 18 years,\"" related poet Eliaz Cohen from Kibbutz Kfar Etzion. \""He was a bulldozer, but all of his efforts never penetrated the population. For many years we searched for a Palestinian group that shared our dream.\""\n\nTHE INITIAL shidduch (match) between the Jewish and Palestinian peace activists was through John Moyle, an American pastor from the Washington area who'd been working in the West Bank as a peacemaker for years. \""He was the first person to understand that there were Jewish settlers and Palestinians living in the same area that could be brought together,\"" explains Cohen.\n\n\""After several years of studying the Arab-Israeli conflict and more importantly, building real and trusting relationships with many Israelis and Palestinians living in the West Bank, I began to realize that the great separation that had been created over time between the two peoples in the land was a central cause of the violence and conflict, and was doing literally nothing to reduce or prevent it,\"" Moyle told The Jerusalem Report. \""It became clear to me that separating Israelis and Palestinians from each other - even though they might live in neighboring communities! - made it nearly impossible for them to build relationships with each other.\""\n\nMoyle began meeting with scores of Jews and Palestinians who might be interested in getting to know each other. \""I was looking for the 'jewels,' those willing to take a risk and meet in person with those from the other side,\"" he relates.\n\nThe first meeting that would establish Roots took place in January 2014 on the ENTITY Awwad family property. In a symbolic act, Ali and Khaled ENTITY Awwad gave the Jewish visitors a key to the gate, stating \""if you need a place to bring people together to work for peace - you are welcome here.\"" Nearly 80 Jews and Palestinians from the surrounding settlements and towns took part in the first general encounter later that month, which participants would describe as \""transformative.\""\n\nOnly six months later the group faced its first real crisis. Three Jewish teenagers from Gush Etzion were kidnapped and murdered, followed by the murder of a Palestinian teen by Jewish Israelis. \""The entire area was on fire, everyone was so enraged,\"" recalls Cohen. \""That's when we realized the relationships we had developed through Roots were stronger than anything else - we found that we needed each other.\""\n\nROOTS IS supported in part by a registered nonprofit association in Geneva called B8 of Hope that today backs a dozen grassroots efforts in Israeli and Palestinian societies. Roots was the first of these.\n\nIt all started with a personal trip Mehra Beit and her husband took to Israel with their children in the summer of 2014. Both Swiss citizens, her husband is Jewish while Mehra is Muslim. Their friend Jean-Marc Liling, a Swiss human rights attorney, took them to visit the Roots compound in Gush Etzion.\n\n\""This was the time of the kidnapping and murders, but we didn't know this, though we could see he was nervous\"" Beit tells the Report via phone from Geneva. \""We went there in the middle of this madness, and met the inspiring co-founders of Roots. We were blown away that this could exist - this dialogue between Palestinians who might have been prisoners, and these religious Jewish settlers. It seemed crazy.\""\n\nOn returning to Switzerland they decided to invite representatives from Roots to talk to their friends and acquaintances about their organization.\n\n\""In Switzerland, Jews and Arabs are very friendly,\"" explains Beit. \""They socialize, and golf together, but there is an elephant in the room and they never talk about the conflict so they won't make each other uncomfortable. But we thought everyone would be at ease here because it's not about the conflict, more about the solution.\""\n\nDemand to hear the speakers was so great that they organized six presentations in synagogues, schools and Muslim centers. It was so successful that six of the couple's friends suggested setting up a nonprofit to help this \""pro-solution\"" grassroots effort to pave a path for a solution. Thus the eight - a mixture of nationalities and faiths, including Muslims and Jews - founded B8 (for Beit/Bayit) of Hope.\n\nAfter a series of workshops and lectures in Geneva, the founders decided to help other organizations.\n\n\""We thought, let's give them visibility and opportunities, because all of us are from different professions and have lots of connections,\"" explains Beit. Little by little, B8 of Hope added other not-for-profits, and is currently supporting 11 organizations including Combatants for Peace, The Jerusalem Youth Chorus, The Parents Circle Families Forum, The Road to Recovery, and Women Wage Peace.\n\n\""What is interesting to us in all these groups is the humanization effect of their activities,\"" explains Beit. \""We like movements that create unity within a society, breaking down stereotypes and bridge-building. Roots does this really beautifully.\""\n\nJudelman says he believes that the organization and other movements can point the way to a model for \""more creative political solutions than just the one-state or two-state paradigm.\""\n\nRaz Kones, a former career Israeli army officer, is coordinator of Roots' youth division. Speaking at a Geneva gala dinner fund-raiser last spring, she conceded that both Israeli and Palestinian young people are pressured not to belong to the group. But, Kones insisted, \""The value of our work has proven itself. We created a space where youth from both sides can get involved in their societies and show there is another way. We both have no other land, and that is exactly why we cannot stop until we find a solution to this conflict.\""\n\nSpeaking at New York's Fordham University last year, Roots international leader Rabbi Hanan Schlesinger from the settlement of Alon Shvut told the audience: \""I see it again and again - Palestinians and Israelis coming to our center with hesitancy, with fear, like there's a red line in the sand. But when the meeting takes place, I often see a sense of liberation on people's faces as the fear dissipates, and the disease begins to be healed, and people become, in my mind, whole... and a little bit more human.\""\n\nSchlesinger and Roots Youth Leader Shadi ENTITY Awwad (Ali ENTITY Awwad's son) are on a speaking tour throughout the US until the end of November.

ABU AHMED GROUP,0,"The far-right party linked to a string of murders and other violent acts once enjoyed considerable success at the ballot box.\n\nIn recent weeks, a handful of high-ranking Golden Dawn members have testified in the ongoing trial of the party, shedding light on the neo-Nazi party's internal operations and violent attacks on political opponents and migrants.\n\nIn September 2013, Golden Dawn member and cafeteria employee Giorgos Roupakias stabbed and killed 34-year-old anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas in Keratsini, a suburb of the port city Piraeus.\n\nIn the wake of Fyssas's murder, authorities cracked down on Golden Dawn, arresting dozens of members in a massive operation that targeted the party.\n\nSince April 2015, 69 Golden Dawn members- including much of the party's leadership- have been on trial for charges including allegedly operating a criminal organisation.\n\nWhat's Golden Dawn's history?\n\nIn 1980, Nikos Michaloliakos, who had a history of violent crimes and far-right activism, founded a national socialist journal called Golden Dawn.\n\nFive years later, Michaloliakos registered the political association Popular National Movement - Golden Dawn, shortly after breaking away from the ultra-nationalist National Political Union.\n\nDocuments from that period demonstrate Golden Dawn's adherence to National Socialism - the ruling ideology of Nazi Germany - and photographs show prominent members posing in front of Nazi flags and performing fascist salutes.\n\nAlthough Golden Dawn occupied the political fringes, members of the group carried out a number of attacks in the early 1990s, most notably during demonstrations over the Macedonia name dispute between Greece and its northern neighbour.\n\nFollowing the widespread upheaval over the Macedonia dispute, Golden Dawn registered as a political party in 1993.\n\nBut Golden Dawn found little success in the early years following its recognition as a political party. During the 1994 European Parliament elections, the party garnered less than a percent of the vote nationwide.\n\nIn September 1996, Golden Dawn participated in legislative elections for the first time, but the outcome was again unimpressive: the party only 4,487 votes around the country, less than a single percentage point.\n\nMeanwhile, Golden Dawn continued to build a base of hardline followers, many of them regularly engaging in violence.\n\nIn 1998, prominent Golden Dawn member Antonis Androutsopoulos participated in the brutal beating of leftwing student activist Dimitris Kousouris, who was subsequently hospitalised for severe injuries. (Years later, Androutsopoulos was convicted of attempted murder for that incident.\n\nViolence\n\nGolden Dawn christened its long wave of violence against political opponents in the early 1990s.\n\nIn December 1992, party members are believed to have executed attacks on leftists and other political opponents after massive demonstrations over the country's longstanding name dispute with its northern neighbour, Macedonia.\n\nInvestigative reporter Dimitris Psarras, author of several books on Greece's radical right, was one of the few journalists closely tracking the organisation in its early years. \They had to show that they were different,\"" he told TRT World, \""so they carried out these attacks.\""\n\nIn 1998, a prominent Golden Dawn member Antonios \""Periandros\"" Androutsopoulos assaulted Dimitris Kousouris, a leftwing student activist who had to be hospitalised owing to his injuries.\n\n\""Only then the system began to [understand],\"" Psarras explained of the 1998 incident.\n\nThe attack shocked many, but most observers still predicted that the party would not make much headway in electoral politics, pointing to its poor performance in 1994 European Parliament elections and 1996 legislative elections.\n\nThe party briefly dissolved in 2005, but party chief Nikos Michaloliakos announced in 2007 that Golden Dawn had resumed its political activities.\n\nAlthough still largely on the outskirts of Greek politics, the party gradually constructed a base of hardline supporters.\n\nWhen the global financial crisis, which started in 2009, started to send Greece's economy plummeting in 2010, Golden Dawn was confronted with an opportunity.\n\nFar-right violence targeting leftists and immigrants surged around the same time that party leader Michaloliakos landed a seat on the Athens city council in 2010.\n\nThe international watchdog Human Rights Watch documented 51 \""serious attacks\"" between August 2009 and May 2012.\n\nAs Golden Dawn and other far-right groups harnessed anti-immigrant sentiment, the number of attacks surged.\n\nIn many of the instances of violence, attackers came equipped with weapons and shouted anti-immigrant and pro-Golden Dawn slogans, the HRW report notes.\n\nHow successful has Golden Dawn been?\n\nBy the time legislative elections rolled around in May 2012, Golden Dawn had been gaining popularity - partially owing to widespread anger stemming from the country's crippling economic crisis.\n\nDuring that vote, Golden Dawn secured 6.97 percent of the vote and 21 seats, paving the way for the neo-Nazi party to enter the country's parliament for the first time in its existence.\n\nBecause the leading parties in the May vote were unable to form a government, an additional round of elections were held in June 2012.\n\nYet Golden Dawn repeated its success, gaining 6.92 percent of the vote and 18 seats in the Hellenic Parliament.\n\nIn January 2015, even as the left-wing Syriza party surged in the elections and became the lead party in the governing coalition, Golden Dawn became the third largest party in the parliament.\n\nLater that year, in September 2015, Syriza repeated its success in snap elections, and Golden Dawn retained its spot as the third largest party in the parliament.\n\nIt was not until snap elections in July 2019 that Golden Dawn lost its seats in the parliament, after failing to surpass the three-percent threshold parties must obtain to enter the Hellenic Parliament.\n\nMurders\n\nIn August 2012, a group of men on motorcycles murdered a 19-year-old Iraqi immigrant in Athens. The killing went unsolved, but authorities suspected that Golden Dawn had been involved.\n\nIn January 2013, two men stabbed to death Shahzad Luqman, a 27-year-old Pakistani migrant worker, in the capital. When police subsequently raided their homes, they found Golden Dawn pamphlets and weapons. (Both men are currently named as defendants in the ongoing trial of Golden Dawn.\n\nLater that year, in September 2013, Golden Dawn member Giorgos Roupakias fatally stabbed a 34-year-old anti-racist rapper, Pavlos Fyssas, in the Keratsini area of Piraeus.\n\nFyssas's death proved to be a turning point, and authorities belatedly clamped down on Golden Dawn. Dozens of members -- including most of the party's leadership -- were arrested and slapped with a host of charges.\n\nThe trial\n\nAlthough the trial initially did little to detract from Golden Dawn's support, the legal proceedings have been costly.\n\nAdditionally, worrisome revelations that have emerged throughout the trial detail the extent of the party's involvement in organised violence and potentially criminal activities.\n\nThroughout the trial, a harrowing theme has been the complicity of many locals and Greek authorities during the bloodiest periods of far-right violence.\n\nIn 2016, migrant fishermen from Egypt testified about Golden Dawn attacks four years prior in Perama.\n\nExplaining that he and others were targeted because they were foreign-born nationals, Egyptian fish shop owner ENTITY ENTITY Hamad recalled 15 black-clad men arriving at a home where he lived with several others in June 2012.\n\n\""I saw them face-to-face,\"" he said, as reported by the Greek daily Kathimerini at the time, adding that he believed his attackers targeted them because \""we are Muslims, dark-skinned and they want us out of the country\"".\n\nTapped phone calls entered into evidence have revealed close ties between Golden Dawn members and some Greek police officers.\n\nIn recent weeks, high-ranking Golden Dawn members have taken the stand and attempted to deflect responsibility for members' actions.\n\nParty leadership has also sought to downplay Golden Dawn's links to neo-Nazi ideology.\n\nGolden Dawn member Ilias Panagiotaros, a former parliamentarian, addressed the court earlier this month, claiming that the party had banned supporters from using the Nazi salute, Kathimerini reported.\n\nAnother former Golden Dawn parliamentarian, Kostas Barbarousis, contradicted Panagiotaros when he said the fascist salute was \""the best there is\"" and had been unfairly \""demonised\"".\n\nAs the party has began to dissolve in the wake of its poor performance in July elections, some analysts believe the infighting has turned many formerly loyal members against one another.\n\nGolden Dawn leader Michaloliakos has consistently denied accusations that the party had played a central role in organising violence. Rather, he claims that the ongoing prosecution was part of an effort to clamp down on the party for its ultra-nationalist politics."

ABU AHMED GROUP,1,"Al-Baghdadi personally promoted and participated in the systematic rape of women who ISIS considered non-believers. He held an American woman, Kayla Mueller, captive as a sex slave before she was killed.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Sunday that US Special Forces killed ENTITY Bakr al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader of the Islamic State, during a raid in the Idlib province of Syria on Saturday.\n\n\Last night, the United States brought the world's number one terrorist to justice,\"" Trump announced at a nationally-televised Sunday morning press conference. \""ENTITY Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead.\""\n\nThe self-declared caliph of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Al-Baghdadi, 48, was instrumental in building the Islamic State into one of the most potent terrorist groups in history that, at its height, controlled a territory the size of Great Britain.\n\nThe secretive jihadist was born as Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri in a village in central Iraq to a Sunni Muslim family and was educated in the city of Samarra. His family claimed to descend from the Prophet Muhammad's tribe, which made it possible for al-Baghdadi to later become the leader of the Islamic caliphate.\n\nHe took to a conservative interpretation of Islam early in his life and received an undergraduate degree from the Shariah College of University of Baghdad in 1996. Three years later, he earned a master's degree in Koranic recitation from the Saddam University for Islamic Studies.\n\nHe interrupted his doctorate work to join the fight against American forces after the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nAl-Baghdadi, whose nom de guerre was then \""ENTITY Dua,\"" was arrested at the home of his parents-in-law near Falluja in January 2004. His brother-in-law, who'd been fighting the American invasion of Iraq, was the target of the raid. Al-Baghdadi was ultimately detained at Camp Bucca, which housed tens of thousands of Iraqis in communal tents, for 11 months.\n\n\""He was a street thug when we picked him up in 2004,\"" an anonymous Pentagon official told The New York Times in 2014. \""It's hard to imagine we could have had a crystal ball then that would tell us he'd become head of ISIS.\""\n\nExperts say Al-Baghdadi's stay at the detention center helped facilitate his radicalisation and served as a planning headquarters for ISIS. He was chosen as a leader by fellow prisoners in the camp, making alliances with other Sunni prisoners and former Iraqi Baathists.\n\nIt was there that al-Baghdadi met and became a follower of Jordanian jihadist, ENTITY Musab al-Zarqawi, who would go on to lead al-Qaeda in Iraq.\n\n\""We could never have all got together like this in Baghdad, or anywhere else,\"" ENTITY, a jihadist imprisoned with al-Baghdadi at Camp Bucca, told The Guardian in 2014. \""It would have been impossibly dangerous. Here, we were not only safe, but we were only a few hundred meters away from the entire Al Qaeda leadership.\""\n\nMore broadly, many argue that the US invasion and occupation of Iraq in the early 2000s motivated and fueled al-Baghdadi's rise.\n\n\""He is Iraqi to the core, and his extremist ideology was sharpened and refined in the crucible of the American occupation,\"" Tim Arango and Eric Schmitt of The Times wrote of al-Baghdadi in 2014. \""The American invasion presented Mr. Baghdadi and his allies with a ready-made enemy and recruiting draw. And the American ouster of Saddam Hussein, whose brutal dictatorship had kept a lid on extremist Islamist movements, gave Mr. Baghdadi the freedom for his radical views to flourish.\""\n\nThe US military released him in December 2004.\n\nFor years, very little was known about al-Baghdadi. He served as a religious adviser to al-Qaeda terrorist cells in Iraq. As US forces dealt significant blows to al-Qaeda's leadership, the spiritual instructor rose to become the top leader in 2010 of what was then the Islamic State of Iraq.\n\nThe Arab Spring, which began in late 2010, and the civil war in Syria, which began in early 2011, provided his weakened group with new motivation, fighters, and weapons. His fighters eventually captured the eastern Syrian city of Raqqa.\n\nBy the early summer of 2014, Islamic State forces shocked the world by seizing control of one-third of Iraq, including the country's second-largest city, Mosul, and half of Syria.\n\nIn his only filmed public address, al-Baghdadi declared the founding of the caliphate in a speech in a Mosul mosque in 2014, telling his followers, \""Know that today you are the defenders of the religion and the guards of the land of Islam.\""\n\nThere were multiple reports that al-Baghdadi was killed or injured in various attacks over the last few years, but all of them proved false.\n\nThe Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ultimately recruited tens of thousands of fighters from 100 countries, according to The Times. It carried out or inspired terrorist attacks that have killed thousands in countries around the world and became perhaps best known for its extraordinarily brutal, gruesome murder and torture of its prisoners, including Americans.\n\nThose attacks included suicide bombings at a Sri Lankan church on Easter Sunday this year, the massacre at a German Christmas market in 2016, and the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernadino, California.\n\nThe group used the internet to build networks of support around the world, enforced extreme religious rules inspired by Islamic theocracies in the Middle Ages, and brutally targeted religious minorities, including the Yazidis.\n\nAl-Baghdadi personally promoted and participated in the systematic rape of women who ISIS considered non-believers, including an American ISIS captive, Kayla Mueller, who al-Baghdadi kept as one of several of his sex slaves. ISIS reported Mueller was killed in a Jordanian airstrike in 2015.\n\nWhile the Islamic State has lost control of virtually all of its territory, there remain widespread fears that the group will re-emerge or morph into a new terrorist movement, and that its ideas will not die along with its leaders."

He steadily built his career over the next couple of years before creating a buzz with some impressive displays on \ShoBox,\"" notably against Abel Ramos (RTD 8) and Joel Diaz Jr. (TKO 2). The 30-year-old's rise continued when he stopped former unified beltholder Julius Indongo (TKO 2) inn March of last year. \""Rougarou\"" entered the WBSS as the No. 1 seed and has since bested Terry Flanagan (UD 12) and stopped Kiryl Relikh (TKO 6) to win the WBA title.\n\nTaylor, who is rated No. 2 by The Ring, was a top amateur, winning silver at the 2010 Commonwealth Games before upgrading to gold in 2014. He also represented his country at the 2011 and 2013 World Championships and fought at the 2012 Olympics. The 28-year-old has moved quickly since transitioning to the professional game in 2015, scoring eye-catching wins over previously unbeaten Ohara Davies (TKO 7), former lightweight titlist Miguel Vazquez (KO 9) and former junior welterweight kingpin Viktor Postol (UD 12). Taylor has beaten Ryan Martin (TKO 7) and Ivan Baranchyk (UD 12) to win the IBF title in the WBSS tournament.\n\nBoth men are southpaws. Who will deal with that better? Both are renowned body-punchers. Who is able to employ hi body-attack better? This is the best opponent either has faced to date, Who will handle that better? Will home advantage play a part?\n\nOnline gambling group William Hill lists Prograis as a 6/10 (-167) favorite, while Taylor is priced at 13/10 (+130); the draw is 20/1 (+2000).\n\nTOM GRAY: TAYLOR SD\n\nI picked Taylor to win the WBSS and I'm sticking to it as we enter the final. The Scotsman has wonderful skills, juxtaposed alongside toughness, spite and punching power. There is no question that Prograis is Taylor's most formidable opponent to date. The American is an excellent technician, who matches Taylor for hand speed and power. However it's Taylor's foot speed and distance control that are likely to get him over the line. I don't foresee a shootout, a knockout or even a knockdown. I envision 12 rounds of high-quality combat and it will be a joy to watch. This is just the beginning for both men.\n\nMICHAEL WOODS: PROGRAIS SD\n\nThe winner, with a solid outing, could be getting more pound-for-pound talk. Hey now - another coin flip fight! I may be inclined to give Regis more love because of familiarity, as I contemplate the comparison of assets. Both men are stepping up, will see skill sets a notch above anything they've dealt with. Expect even rounds, a split decision...Prograis by a hair.\n\nMARTY MULCAHEY: TAYLOR UD\n\nJosh Taylor and Regis Prograis are two boxer/punchers entering the fight on equal highs, given the WBSS format. The small things and intangibles will make the difference. I lean toward Taylor, given the fight in his territory and Taylor holds advantages in height, reach and bigger overall build. More importantly Taylor knows how to use these advantages. Key, for me, is the composure Taylor showed deconstructing the bullying style of Ivan Baranchyk in his last outing. Yes, Prograis is much better and quicker but I don't see Prograis sustaining pressure on Taylor, whose feet are undervalued. Taylor has bested a wider array of styles and his movement will cause hesitation in a Prograis, who thrives when in rhythm. Much like the Errol Spence-Shawn Porter fight, Prograis lands some big shots but is unable to outbox Taylor, who maintains distance picking him apart for a unanimous decision win.\n\nANSON WAINWRIGHT: TAYLOR MD\n\nTwo terrific fighters and competitors. Another tough fight to pick, I've gone back and forth on this one. Ultimately I can't see Prograis winning on the road in what is perceived as Taylor's backyard. It will be difficult for Prograis to separate himself enough in a close fight to win. Both guys will have their moments but Taylor will win a hard-fought majority decision.\n\nGARETH A. DAVIES: PROGRAIS SD\n\nTaylor vs. Prograis is a genuine 50/50 pick 'em fight. There is little to separate the two men in terms of how they have performed as they stepped up, in their respective styles, and in the unshakeable self-belief they both have in the ring and as men. If I have to crawl off the fence, I am going to pick Prograis based on the explosive power he possesses, which can change the course of a fight. Prograis may put Taylor down. For me, Taylor can be drawn into a war, in spite of not needing to do so, being highly skilled and technical. But this will be a war and unless Taylor imposes himself - which he may do - Prograis ekes a razor-tight decision. It would not surprise me if it were controversial too. Prograis, victor by split points decision.\n\nNORM FRAUENHEIM: PROGRAIS UD\n\nIt might be the toughest fight to pick this year. That might make it 'Fight of the Year.' Josh Taylor, a Scotsman, has momentum. He has power. And he'll have the crowd at O2 Arena but does he have enough in his skill set to counter all that Prograis can do and does? Over 12 rounds, Prograis will throw a lot of different looks and punches from different angles, all enough to take control in the later rounds of a fight he wins in a close yet unanimous decision.\n\nBOXING INSIDERS\n\nMIKE ALTAMURA (MANAGER): TAYLOR UD\n\nGreat fight between two high-class southpaws. Taylor is technically more polished but Prograis is definitely the more physical in the fight. If Taylor can nullify Prograis' strength inside, I see him edging a tightly contested bout.\n\nJOSE RAMIREZ (WBC/WBO JUNIOR WELTERWEIGHT TITLIST): PROGRAIS PTS\n\nI think it's a very tough fight for both fighters. I think it's a very competive fight, two different styles and we'll see who is the better man that night. I think Prograis is the hungrier fighter of the two but I think Taylor is the more technical. I'd be delighted to fight either one of them in the near future, so we can put all the titles on the line to have an undisputed champion in 2020. It's a 50/50 fight. I'm going with Prograis, I think it's definitely going to go the distance.\n\nDUKE MCKENZIE (FORMER THREE-DIVISION TITLEHOLDER/TV ANALYST): TAYLOR UD\n\nPrograis and Taylor is a mouth-watering fight. I'm hard-pushed to pick a winner. I like Prograis; he does more right than wrong but the smart money has to be Taylor, who looks like he's at his peak now. Taylor is very intelligent; he picks his punches well. Let's hope this fight doesn't end via cuts. I think Taylor wins a unanimous points decision.\n\nKATHY DUVA (PROMOTER, MAIN EVENTS): PROGRAIS UD\n\nPrograis-Taylor is such a good fight but I think that Prograis might be a bit more technically proficient at this point. Taylor will certainly bring it and so the fight should go the limit, with Prograis willing a close unanimous decision.\n\nRICKY HATTON (FORMER TWO-DIVISION WORLD TITLIST/TRAINER): PROGRAIS PTS\n\nThis is a tough one to call. They are both unbeaten with a great knockout rate. It'a genuine 50/50 fight and potentially one of the best fights for 2019. Prograis has an impressive record of wins at the top level but Josh has shown he is world-class as well in his recent fights. London is almost home advantage for Josh and that could be a big factor with the judges but I'm going for Prograis by points.\n\nCAMILLE ESTEPHAN (PROMOTER, EYE OF THE TIGER): TAYLOR UD\n\nI believe it will be close, hard-fought rounds. I believe Taylor is the man to beat currently in the division. I think Taylor by unanimous decision.\n\nRONNIE SHIELDS (TRAINER): PROGRAIS\n\nI've known Regis for a very long time, even before he turned professional. He's a good kid; he's a strong fighter and very confident fighter. It's going to be tough for Josh Taylor because Regis is walking through guys right now. I think, right now, he's going to be too strong for Josh. Josh is a good fighter in his own right. I just think it's Regis' time.\n\nSERGIO MORA (FORMER WORLD CHAMPION/COMMENTATOR): PROGRAIS PTS\n\nI've been looking forward to this one some time now. Both southpaws are high IQ fighters. I really like Taylor's skills but I like Prograis by decision. It'll be competitive until the end.\n\nVADIM KORNILOV (MANAGER): TAYLOR\n\nI think that it's a very competitive fight. We had Postol fight Taylor; he is very strong and technically sound. Prograis also has great punching power. I think it's a 50/50 fight but would give Taylor the edge.\n\nFRANK WARREN (PROMOTER, QUEENSBURY PROMOTIONS): TAYLOR\n\nIt's going to be a great fight. I watched Prograis live vs. Flanagan in New Orleans and he was very impressive. Strong, aggressive and very clever inside. Picks his shots well. Taylor is in for a long night if he gets into a brawl but if he boxes like we all know he can and doesn't get drawn in to a scrap, I fancy him to come out on top via a close decision. Keep it long and off the jab.\n\nMICHAEL AMOO-BEDIAKO (TRAINER): PROGRAIS PTS\n\nThis is a very interesting fight, two southpaws, which takes away both of their advantages. I like Josh Taylor a lot. He's very well-schooled and has a great style albeit when he fights orthodox fighters, good amateur background aligned with a very good trainer in Shane McGuigan, who will always bring him ready with an excellent game plan. Regis Prograis, to me, is a little bit more rugged but has that much more experience and is very confident in his own ability. He seems unfazed no matter who's in front of him and has that patience about him to pick his shots well without wasting a lot of energy. He totally out-boxed Terry Flanagan, another southpaw, which I think gives him the slight advantage in this fight. I think it's a very close fight but I take Prograis on points as he just has that little bit more experience and this fight may have just come a bit too soon for Taylor but a very close fight.\n\nRICK MIRIGIAN (MANAGER): PROGRAIS TKO\n\nI think Prograis stops Taylor late and overwhelms him with physicality and heart. Prograis has a better resume so far, more fights and there is no substitute for heart. Then he comes back to the USA and gets knocked out and gives (Jose) Ramirez both belts - we don't want the the fake ones; (Prograis) can keep those for his house or give to Dereck Chisora for Christmas - next year and retires and opens an alligator farm in New Orleans.\n\nSTEPHEN EDWARDS (TRAINER): TAYLOR SD\n\nThis is a tough fight to call. Prograis is really clever with his pressure. He also throws hard, straight, short punches that do more damage than people realize. He has solid defense for an offensive fighter. Taylor, in my opinion, is struggling to make weight. There is a look to his body that I don't like but I am very high on Taylor. My gut feeling tells me Taylor will move his feet more than we expect and get the nod in a tight, controversial, draw-ish type of fight. Don't be surprised if this is a draw but my official pick is Taylor by split decision.\n\nWAYNE MCULLOUGH: (FORMER WORLD CHAMPION/TRAINER): TAYLOR PTS\n\nInteresting fight with both unbeaten and also southpaws. Prograis likes to be aggressive, which should suit Taylor. Prograis has a good straight left and hurtful left shot to body, so Taylor will have to be aware of that and block them with his right elbow nice and tight to his body with his hand covering his head, then come straight back with a straight left to the head or body or a right hook to the head or body of Prograis. If he can do this and hurt Prograis, he will control the fight and box his way to a close points win. Tough fight either way."
Kamal Mustafa,1,"Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) Chairman Syed ENTITY said that he has been accused of unlawful allotment of a plot of land while the fact is that neither any sort of allotment was made nor he had any powers to exercise in that context and hence the overall case is baseless as it never occurred in his life. It is just like someone is alleged of murder of a particular person while he is still alive.\n\nHe was talking to the newsmen outside the national Accountability Court here in Karachi, Saturday. While speaking on other anomalies that have gripped this mega city, the revenue engine of Pakistan, the port city of Karachi, ENTITY said that it happens today that the apex court has to intervene in even petty issues while those mega issues are out questions. The apex court has to take suo moto notice of a dog-bite case, as well, which is so deplorable on the part of the civil administration.\n\nThe PSP Chairman ENTITY said that people are starving due to skyrocketing prices of common men's commodities and even they are on the verge of starvation and are forced to commit suicide.\n\nOn the issue of corruption in the country, he was of the opinion that the menace of corruption has despite gigantic measure for curbing by the federal government, it has drastically spread in nook and cranny of departments and instead it should have been curbed the rates of bribe have immensely increased.\n\nThere is everywhere a panic-like situation and widespread unrest everywhere and it is uncertain which direction the country is being driven to. The menace of corruption is eating the country like termites and even the funds for the procurement of astray dog culling poison is also being embezzled. Nobody is concerned on ten to twenty deaths from rabies that resulted from astray dog bites. There are numerous dog bite cases being reported daily in Karachi but the anti-rabies vaccines and dog culling steps are missing.\n\nHe said that the Prime Minister had during his visit to Karachi avoided meeting the people of the city and he had described a variety of key issues of Karachi that he forgot with this return of Islamabad such as issuance of CNIC to Afghans and Bengalis, lack of Master Plan for the port city, which he (PSP Chairman) had personally prepared when he was the Nazim of the city in 2007. The Karachi Package to the tune of Rs.162bln is yet to come to the city, he deplored, adding that the pm had inaugurated a university for Hyderabad city at PM House in Islamabad and the University is still being looked for on ground.\n\nHe said that deaths from electrocution due to ineligibility of K-Electric are rampant in the city while the PM could not ask his friend, Arif Naqvi of K-Electric as what he was doing with the people of Karachi.\n\nENTITY said that Karachi needs greater water supply project, K-IV but sadly the Sindh provincial government has decided to close that programme after spending Rs.25bln on it and the contractors heavily benefited in this project.\n\nThe PSP Chairman said that the provincial government is making attempts to privatise the Karachi water and sewerage Board while water facility has never been kept on hands of private operators across the world. This act would be tantamount to collective suicide, he deplored."

The proposal was one of the items on MIER's budget wish list.\n\nMeanwhile, today's programme was an effort by Malaysian Industrial Development Finance Bhd's (MIDF) Development Finance Division (DFD) to promote its financing schemes and create awareness to encourage local entrepreneurs to work together with government agencies.\n\nAmong others, it showcased MIDF's achievements in improving the small and medium enterprises' contribution to the economy for certain sectors or industries targeted by the Government through its various loan schemes.\n\nAlso present during the programme was DFD head Azizi ENTITY.\n\nOng expressed hope that SME manufacturers, in migrating towards Industry 4.0, would seek financing support from MIDF to help them increase their productivity and performance.\n\nSince 2008, MIDF has approved 2,090 loans totalling RM2.65 billion to SMEs in the manufacturing and service sectors for the northern region -- covering Perak, Penang, Kedah and Perlis -- to help develop local businesses.\n\nMIDF has, since its establishment in 1960, assisted 11,102 local companies with approved financing totalling RM15.15 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in Kedah, Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia deputy president Datuk Seri Mukhriz Tun Mahathir said the Government would take into account the views of everyone, especially the public, before making any move to reintroduce the GST.\n\n\""The people's interest is given much importance; that's why we will listen to their views in addition to those of the economic experts. If the people do not want the GST, there's no need for it. But if they want us to bring back GST, we will have to study it first.\n\n\""I would like to understand what is the problem with the SST system, which seems okay to me. While the SST has some weakness, it is going well. It is better than the previous tax regime (GST) with a rate of six per cent, which was viewed as high,\"" he told reporters in Alor Setar when asked on Dr Mahathir's statement regarding the need to study the reintroduction of the GST.\n\nEarlier, Mukhriz, who is also Kedah Menteri Besar, officiated at the launch of Amanah Raya Bhd's (AmanahRaya) Alor Setar branch office. Also present was AmanahRaya chairman Datuk Mohd Nasir Ali and group managing director Adenan Md Yusof."
AGUIRRE SANCHEZ,1,"Because America has deported something deadly: its opioid crisis.\n\nJulio Moreno is 31. He's been using drugs since the age of 12. Living in the Mexican border city of Mexicali, he's seen it all: heroin, cocaine, crack, meth, marijuana. But in September this year, Moreno tried something for the first time: fentanyl.\n\n\It really knocked me out, but it's better than heroin,\"" he told OZY on a recent Sunday morning at the local outreach center, Verter, where he goes to exchange his old syringes for new ones. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid at least 50 times stronger than heroin and gives users a stronger high. The biggest cause of drug overdoses in the United States in 2019, fentanyl has now crossed the border into Mexico, where those who work with drug users are seeing overdoses spike.\n\nOfficial figures in Mexico reported only six fentanyl overdoses in 2015. In 2017, they reported 37 -- but that's likely the tip of the iceberg. This week, Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) announced that addiction is now a major focus for his administration due to the scale of the problem.\n\n\""This is all you're going to be hearing and seeing on the radio and on television and in the newspapers -- only this for a while. And going forward ... we are going to dedicate a day a week showing advances in our plan: why fentanyl is spreading, its effects, everything,\"" he said.\n\nRicardo Mejía Berdeja, Mexico's deputy director of public security, said that growing consumption of the synthetic opioid is a new problem: \""It's mostly invading the North American market, but now it's damaging our country too.\""\n\nAn OZY investigation reveals that fentanyl is part of a two-pronged crisis that's turning the country -- traditionally known more as a route for narcotics meant for the U.S. -- into a bigger domestic market for drugs than ever before. With American authorities under the Trump administration tightening border security and cracking down on the production of illicit drugs in their territory, Mexican cartels are increasingly flooding their homeland instead with fentanyl and methamphetamine, another synthetic drug.\n\n\""We're going to get to the root of this, getting rid of the cancer of addiction, as a way of taking resources out of criminal organizations that get money and power from the local [drug] market,\"" said Mejía.\n\nThe number of Mexicans who reported having used drugs once in their lives nearly doubled between 2011 and 2016, from just over 5 percent to roughly 10 percent, according to a government survey. That explosion in drug use coincides with the highest homicide rates the country has seen in modern history, with an average of 90 murders every day.\n\nThe Mexican state is struggling to cope with the expansion in drug consumption and doesn't have the infrastructure to provide the care that people need, its officials concede. That's placing NGOs like Verter on the front lines of the battle to contain this growing epidemic.\n\nA two-hour drive west from Verter in Mexicali, the local needle-exchange program Prevencasa confronts the same reality in the border town of Tijuana. Some 18 months ago, they started to see a new trend: a spike in overdoses that coincided with the arrival of a white powder \""heroin\"" known as China White. But this isn't the infamous China White -- pure heroin from Southeast Asia -- of the 1980s. It's just another name for synthetic, black-market fentanyl, and Prevencasa has the tests to prove it.\n\n\""Today, they have taken the same label and applied it to fentanyl, since it is also white and most of it comes from China,\"" says Mike Vigil, who, as the former chief of international operations at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), spent nearly two decades working in Mexico.\n\n\""Fentanyl is now the majority of the 'heroin' consumed in Tijuana, based on what we're seeing in Prevencasa,\"" says Joseph Friedman, an MD/Ph.D. student from the University of California, Los Angeles, who is doing research with the outreach program on heroin use in Tijuana.\n\n\""It's faster-acting and has led to a big spike in overdoses, which are fatal if you don't treat them,\"" Friedman notes. \""There is a subjective difference that a lot of people report between what you experience with a black tar heroin as opposed to China White/fentanyl -- a stronger initial come-on that goes down faster and provokes other weird sensations. Something is different.\""\n\nThe United States is deporting some of its opioid crisis south of the border, says Friedman.\n\nFriedman notes, \""The U.S. opioid epidemic is a massive wave of suffering, and some percent of that wave is deportable -- and the deported fraction ends up here and then what happens to them? A big fraction of the population became addicted in California and then got deported.\""\n\nMeanwhile, to push meth -- known locally as cristal -- in the border cities, drug sellers have in recent years offered a bonus dose free with heroin, says 41-year-old Lourdes Angulo, who co-founded Verter in Mexicali. \""That was to get them hooked, and that's how the use of cristal started to increase here.\""\n\nThe scale of the crisis is visible to Dr. Clara Fleiz at Mexico's National Institute of Psychiatry, who has been working with organizations such as Prevencasa and Verter to study causes for the rise in overdoses. A survey conducted by her team in the border cities of Tijuana, Mexicali, San Luis Río Colorado and Ciudad Juárez shows that overdoses from fentanyl are going \""higher and higher every day,\"" she says. \""Now, 25 percent [of drug users] have had one in the last year.\""\n\nThat's only going to get worse. As the U.S. doubles down on border security, getting drugs across the international line is getting harder and more complicated for criminal organizations. Seizures of fentanyl by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) more than doubled between 2017 and 2018, from 181 to 388 pounds. Meth seizures by the CBP increased from 4,000 pounds in 2014 to 13,400 pounds already this year. In turn, homegrown markets are becoming more of a focus for crime groups, and the protection of local street sales is emerging as a parallel reason for homicides in Mexico.\n\n\""Sadly, we are prey to what the United States does,\"" says Jaime Arredondo, who researches drug and security policy in both the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nIn the city of Irapuato, in the central state of Guanajuato, Luciano Salazar, 35, squints as he looks at his phone. He points to dozens of local users of the Grindr dating app who have put a diamond symbol in their profiles. \""That shows that they either want to buy or sell cristal,\"" he explains. One baggie of meth costs just 50 pesos ($2.50).\n\nSalazar is gay. He estimates that most of those he comes across in the gay community in the city of 600,000 people use cristal -- including in ChemSex parties popular in the male gay population. He himself was an addict for two years. \""I weighed 83 kilos when I started using cristal -- by the end of my addiction, I weighed 53,\"" he says.\n\nCristal is today the most popular drug in Guanajuato, says Raul Espinosa, who works at Irapuato Vive, a nonprofit that assists drug users. Demand for treatment for meth use has grown more than seven-fold in the state, from fewer than 200 in 2013 to nearly 1,400 people seeking help in government clinics in 2018, according to official figures. More than two-thirds of addicts at the state's treatment centers, known by their acronym CIJ in Spanish, are looking for treatment for meth use, and the CIJ is overwhelmed.\n\nIrapuato Vive lies along an industrial corridor that runs through the state and also includes the cities of Celaya, Silao, Salamanca and Leon. Observers say that the long shifts people need to work at car assembly lines and factories or while trucking long distances also encourage meth use -- it helps them keep feeling alert and keeps fatigue at bay. The car industry in Guanajuato -- including factories for General Motors, Pirelli, Volkswagen and Ford -- accounts for 18 percent of the state economy, according to Sophia Huett, Guanajuato's chief of public security. \""One 50-peso dose gets [truck drivers] through the night or all the way to Monterrey,\"" says Espinosa.\n\nThat pattern is also evident in Tijuana, which is littered with factories known as maquilas that produce everything from cars and electronic home appliances to laptops and mobile phones. \""I could concentrate more and think faster when I first started using cristal at work,\"" says German Navarro, 49, a recovering addict in Tijuana. When he was using meth a few years ago, he worked as a dispatcher in the border city, organizing drivers who would truck goods into the U.S. A strong stimulant, meth improved his performance on the job and allowed him to stay alert and awake for longer.\n\nBut the rise in meth use isn't isolated to a few cities. Multiple Mexican states have seen a sharp increase in its use. Demand in five states -- Guanajuato, Jalisco, Michoacán, Sonora and Sinaloa -- more than doubled between 2008 and 2016, according to government figures. Colima saw an eight-fold increase in people reporting use over this period. And most experts interviewed by OZY think government surveys underestimate the scale of the problem.\n\nMeth addiction is more than just a medical issue. The rising levels of meth use also correlate with more homicides. The state of Guanajuato is home to the popular tourist destinations of San Miguel de Allende and the city of Guanajuato, and had never been a homicide hot spot before 2017. But for the past two years, it has witnessed the highest rate of killings in the country. There were 2,609 in 2018, according to the Public System for National Security, and the homicide rate was 57 per 100,000 compared to a national average of 29. This year is on track to be just as bad -- 1,790 murders in the first eight months.\n\n\""The murder rates that we're seeing are scandalous,\"" the state's prosecutor Carlos Zamarripa ENTITY tells OZY.\n\nGuanajuato isn't alone. Where meth use has grown most noticeably, homicides are at brutal levels. Colima's homicide rate currently stands at 103 per 100,000 -- in 2015, it was 19.2. In the southern state of Michoacán, homicide rates have doubled in recent years, from just over 25 per 100,000 in 2015 to nearly 55 this year.\n\nOver the last decade, territorial disputes between cartels over routes into America were the motive for such killings.\n\n\""Slum and urban violence amongst youths tend to be related to retail sales, whereas violence out in the mountains are more high-level hits by the cartels, major confrontations between organizations and disputes over export routes,\"" says Jaime Lopez, a former Mexican law enforcement official who is now a security analyst.\n\nPhotos provided by Zamarripa's office show packets of meth and marijuana clearly marked with branding of the New Generation Jalisco Cartel (CJNG), one of the country's most notorious crime syndicates along with the Sinaloa cartel that Joaquín \""El Chapo\"" Guzmán used to share control of. In August last year, the Mexican military recovered 50 tons of meth in a mountain lab in Sinaloa. Mexican authorities have also seized fentanyl in states such as Michoacán, Jalisco and Sinaloa, and in the last 12 months have found four clandestine laboratories around the country.\n\nEspinosa and drug users at the Irapuato Vive center say that many homicides involve low-level dealers and addicts who are punished by their dealers for buying meth from rival suppliers.\n\n\""The biggest challenge to public security is drug consumption,\"" says Huett. But neither her state government nor the federal administration appears prepared to tackle the crisis.\n\nGady Zabicky knows that he has a problem on his hands. The new head of Mexico's addiction treatment agency -- known by its acronym CONADIC -- is worried not only by the growing use of meth and fentanyl, but also by the falling age of users and the growing number of women getting hooked, according to recent government surveys. \""This is a red flag,\"" says Zabicky.\n\nIn many ways, the arrival of fentanyl use in Mexico is of America's making and a consequence of the opioid crisis currently rocking the U.S., where for years unfettered pharmaceutical companies marketed highly addictive opioid painkillers to medical professionals and patients. Patients got addicted, and when their insurance or prescriptions ran out, they turned to street-market Mexican heroin to feed their habits. Some of that heroin contained fentanyl to make it stronger, although drug users weren't necessarily aware of that because these were illegal drugs.\n\nOnce addicts discovered they were taking fentanyl and that it was a stronger opioid than heroin, some of them left heroin behind altogether. The fentanyl industry that grew out of that demand -- the drug goes into the U.S. direct from China in the postal system as well as via the border produced by Mexican cartels -- has found a new market.\n\n\""Because of our insatiable demand for all kinds of drugs, other countries such as Mexico supply them,\"" says Vigil, the former DEA agent. \""And they also supply users in their own country. Source countries eventually create addiction, drug overdose deaths and devastated communities. Mexico is no exception.\""\n\nBut whatever the origins of the crisis, Zabicky admits that the current Mexican administration simply doesn't have the network to cope. There are state clinics across the country that mostly provide free treatment; 104 CIJ centers and another program known as CAPA, which has some 341 units around the country. They're not enough, and those drug users left out depend upon thousands of private drug treatment centers, the majority of which aren't regulated.\n\nA minority of them can provide the tools people need to get off drugs, but others known as annexos are notorious for imprisoning addicts and abusing their human rights with the aim of curing their habits -- which is illegal but tolerated. Zabicky says that there are some 2,200 around the country, but there are likely many more. In the city of Irapuato alone, users say there are more than 50 private clinics. \""The majority of them don't comply with government norms,\"" admits Zabicky, but the government can't close them down because there isn't enough state help to go around. \""The system would collapse.\""\n\nInstead, Zabicky plans to bring all the private drug clinics operating around Mexico onto the government's radar in order to better train their staff and establish basic norms. But his approach contrasts with that of the government he serves.\n\nAlthough observers welcome President AMLO's renewed focus on addiction, many worry about the tone and approach. The government's current anti-drug-use campaigns warn users that fentanyl kills -- even the first time it's used.\n\n\""I think these kinds of campaigns produce more fear instead of educating people about substance use, which generates negative consequences. These scare tactics don't contribute to a more elevated conversation about drug policy,\"" says Arredondo, the drugs policy researcher.\n\nAnd despite AMLO's publicized push against addiction, federal government money to private organizations such as Prevencasa and Verter in the border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali was cut off at the beginning of the year when he entered office. The cuts were part of the president's fight against corruption.\n\nFleiz at Mexico's National Institute of Psychiatry says that while it's important to filter out corrupt organizations, all groups shouldn't be painted with the same brush. \""I'm in complete disagreement with these budget cuts,\"" she says. \""The people that have been really hard hit are drug users, as there are less resources to help them.\""\n\nApart from its media campaign, part of the government's efforts to address addiction are legislative. A bill for decriminalizing marijuana use and cultivation is currently being debated in the country's senate. It's not clear if and when the bill will pass, and there are doubts as to how effective it could be.\n\nOn the border, activists are taking a more vanguard approach than AMLO. Nancy ENTITY, 43, visited the Verter center in Mexicali early on a recent Sunday afternoon to exchange her dirty needles for clean ones. She then went into the back room and tied a blue tourniquet around her tiny arm before shooting up heroin, as Angulo watched her. This tiny space is the first of its kind in the entire region -- embracing the principle of harm reduction for drug users, rather than criminalization.\n\nAngulo and her colleagues are trying to get vulnerable women like ENTITY to slowly embrace other services they offer such as HIV tests, counseling services and health education. \""We have had to adapt. Here, women can stay as long as they want or need -- and our adviser has to be with them here all the time,\"" says Angulo.\n\nSuch an approach could be a welcome change in Latin America, where laws and policies generally stigmatize users of hard drugs like ENTITY and Moreno. When the Verter safe room opened in September last year, it caused a scandal -- betraying the conservatism of large slices of Mexican society. A national newspaper called it a legal picadero -- slang for places where addicts consume drugs -- and an embarrassed local government shut it down. After a dogged bureaucratic effort by Angulo and her co-founder, the room is operating in a bureaucratic gray zone, registered as a business when it's a nonprofit. \""It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission,\"" says Angulo, shrugging. She doesn't know how much longer the room will remain open.\n\nFor users like Moreno, the government's focus on addiction is too little, too late, but it is early days for other users. In the United States, the government failed to realize what was happening until the situation was critical. Mexico's authorities won't be able to use that excuse if fentanyl addiction here reaches the same levels."

LOS REYES,0,"If you're an up and coming actor, do you want to land a part in a franchise like the Terminator movies? After all, those films have long been dominated by the presence of Arnold Schwarzenegger's title cyborg, and the last two or three entries in the saga have taken their fair share of knocks (and arguably then some).\n\nBut there is still something cool about getting involved in one of sci-fi cinema's most acclaimed and groundbreaking (both visually and thematically) franchises, which is how Mackenzie Davis (Blade Runner 2049), Gabriel Luna (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) and newcomer Natalia ENTITY came to star in Terminator: Dark Fate alongside series icons Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton -- the latter returning to the role of Sarah Connor for the first time in 28 years.\n\nread more: Terminator: Dark Fate review\n\nDavis plays Grace, a cybernetically enhanced super soldier from the future, who is sent back to the present to protect Dani (ENTITY), a young woman who holds the key to that future -- although not exactly as you might expect. \It was amazing when I finally got to read the script,\"" says ENTITY in our interview below. \""Because, you know, they don't really say much when you're auditioning. So when I actually read the script, I was just amazed by, you know, I thought it was a great story but also that my character, I was expecting it to be these Latino characters that we are all used to seeing.\""\n\nShe continues, \""It was one of the main characters. She was not related to drugs, prostitution, or nothing illegal, and it was like a big surprise. It was like, you know, this is great. I think this is a reflection of how the world has changed and Hollywood's changing, and we just want more and bigger representation.\""\n\nread more: What Brought Arnold and Linda Back to the Terminator Saga\n\nDavis agrees with ENTITY that until she read the full script, she had the impression that Grace was a much more straightforward and physical role. \""You go through this process and the last thing you do is read the script,\"" she explains. \""So initially it was Tim (Miller, director) and his enthusiasm and his vision for the movie and him showing me some of the (pre-visualization) realizations of the stunts and my character. It just felt really like, 'Okay, I can't believe you want me to play that.'\""\n\nBut like ENTITY, Davis found more than she expected in the script and character. \""You're just sort of hoping the script is good the whole time,\"" she adds. \""When I read the script, I was very pleasantly surprised and loved the dynamic between Linda and Natalia and my character. But yeah, I think because we didn't have that at first, it really was just this totally different, athletic role to play.\""\n\nFor Gabriel Luna, his role was even more mysterious and different -- that of the Rev-9, the newest killing machine from the future which has a liquid ectoskeleton and an armored endoskeleton, both of which can separate and fight at the same time. How did they explain all that to Luna?\n\n\""They didn't really,\"" replies the actor, who had to deal with extensive visual effects as Robbie ENTITY/Ghost Rider on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. \""The main thing early was they wanted him to be a charming guy. They wanted him to be a friendly face, one that could lure people close to him and then, you know, cut their head off. That was always there.\""\n\nread more: The Tragedy of RoboCop, Terminator and Other AIs\n\nLuna elaborates, \""I started to see some previz, some of the fights and I could see, oh, he has blades or he can form two blades in his hand and it's kind of wielding it almost like a double-sided sword. I was like, \""Oh, that's cool. But that's not really much of an advancement or a technological advancement from the previous (movies).' I was just curious what else was possible. Then, sure enough, I got the script the day before I left for Madrid and I read it. I read the scene where I'm driving the truck and then my endo is driving the truck and my exo goes out onto the hood. I was like, \""Okay, yeah. Now, that is really cool. Now, that's something that people will see and be like, 'Yeah, that's bad ass, dude.'\""\n\nAs the Rev-9 pursues Dani and Grace, the battle is joined early on by Sarah Connor, whom neither ENTITY nor Davis had met prior to their auditions for the movie. \""I met her here in LA,\"" says ENTITY. \""I came for a callback, so I was not expecting that Linda Hamilton was there, but she was there, and I was shocked. I couldn't believe Linda Hamilton was auditioning with me. She's so loving and generous, and she held my hand, and she was hugging me. You know, it was like this love at first sight.\""\n\n\""I met Linda first at a screen test that she flew to Ireland to do with me because I was stuck there shooting a movie and couldn't come back to LA,\"" says Davis. \""Which is such an indication of her character and generosity...I think it's so cool of her. But yeah, I met her in a very small town in Ireland in the conference room of a hotel, and she immediately pushed my shoulders back and told me to stand like a soldier, which scared and thrilled me.

For Gabriel Luna, however, this was still a chance to soak up some advice from the legendary actor on playing a fearsome cyborg.\n\n\""I talked to him a few times,\"" says Luna. \""He was always like, 'Just do it. You've got it. You move your body very well,' he would say. He's a wonderful dude. He's one of my heroes. One of his superpowers is he makes us all feel like we're superheroes. You know what I mean? That's the tale of a great leader and a winner, is he wants to instill his great qualities in those around him, so that we can be better and that we can be elevated and equipped to do the task.\""\n\nBut the most important question is, does Arnold stay in character when the cameras are not rolling or does the T-800 stand down?\n\n\""He's funny,\"" say both ENTITY and Davis, with the latter adding, \""He just wants to tease and joke and have a good time. I feel like he's sorted his life out in a really nice way. He has a group of friends that come with him wherever he works, and they explore new cities. It feels like if you're going to work as much as he has over the course of his life, do it with this group of people that you love and make it fun.\""\n\nLuna says he tried to spend as much time with his co-star as possible. \""I usually always eat lunch with the crew. I always do,\"" he says. \""But in this instance, he always had these really great chess games, chess matches, challenges going on. I was like, 'Man, well, I got to go play some chess with Arnold.'

LOS REYES,0,"Warning: This post contains major spoilers for Terminator: Dark Fate.\n\nIt has been 18 years since Sarah and John Connor prevented Judgment Day, but unlike a certain Jaeger commander, they were never truly able to cancel the apocalypse. The Terminator franchise has attempted three sequels/resets since the release of James Cameron's 1991 action classic -- four if you count the best of the bunch, the underrated TV series The Sarah Connor Chronicles -- only to see each of the post-T2 projects fail to scale the creative and commercial heights of the first two Terminator films.\n\nNow here comes Terminator: Dark Fate, the sixth movie Terminator overall and the first installment that can boast to having Cameron's semi-direct involvement since T2. The Avatar mastermind executive produced the Tim Miller-directed movie, which reunites Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger, while also wiping the slate clean of every other post-Judgment Day story. Rise of the Machines? Terminated. Salvation? Terminated. Genisys? Terminated... with extreme prejudice.\n\nInstead, Dark Fate picks up in 2020, and finds Hamilton's veteran warrior Sarah Connor teaming up with cybernetically enhanced time traveler Grace (Mackenzie Davis) for a mission to protect a young Mexican woman, Daniella (Natalia ENTITY), from assassination by a new, improved Terminator, the shape-shifting Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna). The choice to essentially start over from scratch simplifies franchise's head-scratching continuity, and makes it more complicated at the same time. With that in mind, here's our answers to all the burning questions you'll have before and after seeing Dark Fate.\n\nI haven't seen John Connor in any of the trailers -- does he appear in the movie?\n\nAlong with Cameron, Hamilton hasn't had anything to do with the Terminator franchise since 1991, so the feature film sequels have sought to move the story forward with John rather than his mother. (Genisys is the exception, but even though she gave it the old college try, Emilia Clarke couldn't replace Hamilton.) Dark Fate has been trumpeting the return of the O.G. Sarah Connor since production started, but John's presence has largely gone unaddressed, although Cameron did tell San Diego Comic-Con audiences that Judgment Day star Edward Furlong would be reprising the role he originated, and which was later inherited by Nick Stahl, Christian Bale and Jason Clarke.\n\nCameron told the truth... kind of. Thanks to the magic of CGI, Furlong's youthful face appears in Dark Fate's prologue, which is set in 1998, one year after the Judgment Day that never was. He and Sarah -- who has also been digitally de-aged back to her '90s appearance -- are enjoying a beachside vacation, when a stray T-800 (played by the \young\"" Schwarzenegger) arrives and accomplishes what his predecessors failed to do: terminate John Connor. Its mission complete, the killer robot walks away, leaving Sarah crying over the body of her dead son and the one-time savior of the future.\n\nSo wait: if John's dead now, doesn't that mean Skynet wins?\n\nNo, this is a case of too little, too late. As Sarah explains/retcons, Skynet sent another T-800 back to the past, but by the time it caught up with them, she and John had successfully changed the future by blowing up Cyberdyne and watching the T-1000 and the \""good\"" T-800 drown in molten steel. So even as John's eventual executioner was still following his Skynet-installed code, Skynet as an entity had ceased to be when he pulled the trigger.\n\nHumanity being humanity, though, we can't help but become the eventual architects of our own destruction. While John and Sarah stopped Skynet, in the distant future that Grace hails from -- 2042 to be exact -- Judgment Day was caused by an A.I. called Legion. Created to fight on the side of mankind in cyberwars, Legion inevitably rebelled and blew the world to smithereens, before creating its own army of robot soldiers to wipe out any straggling survivors. \""Those a******s never learn,\"" Sarah sighs when she learns that another group of morons destroyed the planet with the same technology they assumed would save it. Preach, Ms. Connor!\n\nWho's gonna step up and save us now?\n\nSince future-history is repeating itself, Sarah assumes that Grace has been sent back in time to protect Daniella as she's going to give birth to the one person that can defeat Legion. But it turns out that Dani isn't the next Sarah Connor -- she's the next John Connor. Grace was still a young girl when Legion initiated Judgment Day, and she remembers feeling weak and helpless in the immediate aftermath of the nuclear apocalypse. That is, until she crossed paths with Dani, who became her adopted mother and trained her to fight Terminators instead of running from them. Severely wounded following one firefight, Grace voluntarily underwent cybernetic-enhancement and then also volunteered to make a one-way trip to the past to spoil Legion's assassination plot.\n\nAnd in case you're wondering, yes, Dark Fate is keenly aware of the larger sociopolitical statement its making by revealing that humanity's future rests on the fate of a woman from Mexico City. Midway though the film, Sarah, Grace and Dani have to make an illegal crossing into the U.S. and run into Border Patrol agents, who proceed to lock them up in cages along with other immigrants. Those agents are then the first casualties when the Rev-9 shows up and re-enacts the police station sequence from the original Terminator. \""It would feel disingenuous if you were going to do a movie that crossed the Mexican-American border with a Mexican national and didn't [do that] in some way,\"" Miller told Inverse recently. \""When I first walked into that set and you see the extras in the cages, it was a very emotional moment for me. I got on the microphone and apologized to everyone. It was such a really s****y chapter in world history. I felt terrible about. But it has a drama that I felt was appropriate for the story.\""\n\nHow does Ah-nuld factor into all this?\n\nYou've heard of The Last of the Mohicans? Well, an alternate title for Dark Fate could be The Last of the T-800s. Erasing Skynet from the timeline also implies that the T-800 line as we knew it was never created, making John's executioner the final model from a never-opened factory. In the ensuing decades, Sarah has disposed of other time-traveling assassins courtesy of a mysterious benefactor who regularly texts her with details, signing off each message with the words: \""For John.\"" The boy's actual killer, though, has remained elusive... until now. Thanks to Grace's efforts, they've been able to trace those messages back to their source -- a small cabin in rural Texas. After escaping the detention center and the Rev-9, the trio make its way to that location, knock on the door and the T-800 opens it.\n\nHe doesn't introduce himself as \""the T-800,\"" of course. He's acquired another name since Sarah saw him last: Carl. Not only that, but he also has a whole life that includes a job (professional drapery installer), a family (a wife and an adopted son), and a new moral code. Bereft of purpose or direction after killing John, Carl had plenty of time to study humanity and found himself caring for the people he was created to kill. It was that new directive that motivated him to become Sarah's \""For John\"" texter. And now that they're on his doorstep, he's ready to be called back into action for the last time. \""I won't be back,\"" he tells his family and, by extension, the audience. (More on that in a minute.)\n\nThe Terminator got married? And his wife seriously didn't realize she was married to a robot for 20 years?\n\nCarl claims that across those two decades of wedded bliss, his wife didn't expect or want a physical relationship with him. We'll just leave that subject there.\n\nWho makes it out of Dark Fate alive?\n\nNot Carl! Despite being outmatched by the more nimble Rev-9, the sturdy T-800 keeps on ticking and punching through an aerial battle followed by an exhausting brawl at the Hoover Dam. Terminating the Legion-made robot for good requires a double sacrifice. Having determined that an EMP-level attack is the only way to stop the Rev-9 -- and having lost their own EMP -- Grace reaches into her chest and pulls out the battery that keeps her cyborg parts pumping. Dani takes her future daughter's \""heart\"" and plunges it into the Rev-9's chest, just as Carl grabs him and both Terminators take a fatal plunge. Grace dies moments later, secure in the knowledge that the future will still have Dani in it.\n\nThe last scene of the movie takes place sometime later, with Sarah and Dani watching Grace's childhood self running around a playground -- one that looks strikingly similar to the one where Sarah watched Los Angeles burn in her Judgment Day nightmare. Before driving off together, Dani pledges to find a way for Grace to avoid taking her fatal trip through time. Good thing she has an experienced future fighter to help with that.\n\nIs there a post-credits scene?\n\nNope -- feel free to bail once the credits roll.\n\nWill there be a sequel?\n\nWhile the Rev-9 is so much scrap metal, Legion hasn't gone down in defeat like Skynet. That leaves the door open for the dynamic duo of Sarah and Dani to locate the A.I.'s inventors and shut the program down, all while battling yet another robot from the future. Whether we'll see any more of this revised timeline depends largely on Dark Fate's box-office fate. But even if it's a domestic and/or international hit, there's a chance the rights to the franchise could be up for grabs again in 2020. In other words, if Sarah and Dani fail to terminate Legion, copyright law could.\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate is playing in theaters now\n\nLinda Hamilton delivers a classic 'Terminator' line in new 'Dark Fate' trailer\n\nGovernator gone wild: Schwarzenegger cracks jokes about sex, Trump at 'Terminator' Comic-Con panel\n\nJames Cameron reveals dark title for new 'Terminator' movie, teases a 'hardened' Sarah Connor"

Alexander Vindman - the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council and the first witness in the House impeachment inquiry who actually heard the call - said that the rough transcript released by the White House does not include everything that transpired.\n\nThe Army officer, who earned the Purple Heart for valor during combat in Iraq, recalled Zelensky specifically referencing the Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma by name when Trump pushed him to investigate a company related to Joe Biden's son Hunter. Vindman also remembered Trump talking about how the former vice president was on tape boasting about Ukraine funds. This is most likely a reference to comments Biden made last year that the United States iced $1 billion in loan guarantees until the Ukrainian government fired a corrupt former prosecutor, per Karoun Demirjian and Greg Jaffe.\n\nEven if the filled-in gaps don't materially change our previous understanding of what took place, the revelation highlights just how much the public still does not know. As the investigation proceeds at what seems like a rapid pace, it's also an important reminder that official White House pronouncements should not be taken at face value.\n\n-- Vindman not only testified that the rough transcript omitted \""crucial words and phrases,\"" according to the New York Times, but he also said that his efforts to update the record of the call to reflect Trump's mentions of Burisma and Biden on tape failed: \""Colonel Vindman did not testify to a motive behind the White House editing process ... but the decision by a White House lawyer to quickly lock down the reconstructed transcript subverted the normal process of handling such documents ...The note-takers and voice recognition software used during the July 25 call had missed Mr. Zelensky saying the word 'Burisma,' according to people briefed on the matter, but the reconstructed transcript does refer to 'the company,' and suggests that the Ukrainian president is aware that it is of great interest to Mr. Trump. ...\n\n\""After the call, Colonel Vindman was given a hard copy of the rough transcript to make updates and corrections ... Colonel Vindman went through the transcript, made changes and gave his written edits to his boss ... After the call, Colonel Vindman went with his brother, a lawyer on the National Security Council staff, to see John A. Eisenberg, the council's legal adviser, to raise his concerns about the conversation. Colonel Vindman declined to detail to investigators his discussions with Mr. Eisenberg, citing attorney-client privilege...\n\n\""One explanation for why Colonel Vindman's changes were not made could be that the transcript had been quickly placed into a highly secure computer system, the N.S.C. Intelligence Collaboration Environment, or NICE system, making it more difficult to alter. Mr. Eisenberg ordered the transcript moved to ensure that people who were not assigned to handle Ukraine policy could not read the transcript, a decision he hoped would prevent gossip and leaks about the call. Putting the transcript in the secure server would have made it more difficult to make further edits to the document, and in the case of the July call effectively stopped additional changes. Mr. Eisenberg made the decision without consulting with his supervisor, Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel. A White House review of the handling of the call is examining if Mr. Eisenberg acted properly in securing the notes.\""\n\n-- \""One of the Times' examples of how Vindman wanted to adjust the transcript contradicts what the White House said about the transcript when it was released,\"" CNN notes. \""Asked in September why there were three ellipses, a senior White House official said they 'do not indicate missing words or phrases' but 'refer to a trailing off of a voice or pause. If there were missing words or phrases, they would be represented by brackets or redactions. This is the standard practice that is followed for all records of Presidential phone calls.' However, the Times reports that one of the changes to the transcript sought by Vindman was regarding replacing an ellipses: 'The rough transcript also contains ellipses at three points where Mr. Trump is speaking. Colonel Vindman told investigators that at the point of the transcript where the third set of ellipses appears, Mr. Trump said there were tapes of Mr. Biden.'\""\n\nNBC, the AP and BuzzFeed reported that they confirmed various elements of the Times reporting, including that Vindman tried to change the transcript to no avail.\n\n-- Flashback: The initial transcripts that Richard Nixon released of his conversations in the Oval Office were also incomplete. They didn't include the most incriminating material because the then-president edited it out.\n\n-- Vindman's testimony draws fresh attention to the White House's failure to release any rough transcript of Vice President Pence's conversation with Zelensky.\n\n-- Sketchy backchanneling surrounding U.S. policy toward Ukraine long predates this summer. That's a big takeaway from the prepared remarks of two career diplomats who are testifying on the Hill today.\n\nChristopher Anderson, a career Foreign Service officer, will detail efforts when U.S. officials tried to demonstrate support for Ukraine only to be batted down by the White House, including after Russian forces attacked and seized Ukrainian military vessels in the Sea of Azov in 2018. \""While my colleagues at the State Department quickly prepared a statement condemning Russia for its escalation, senior officials in the White House blocked it from being issued,\"" Anderson planned to say.\n\nCatherine Croft, who worked on Ukraine issues at the White House and the State Department, will disclose that she received inexplicable phone calls from Washington lobbyist Robert Livingston, \""who told me that Ambassador Yovanovitch should be fired,\"" referring to Marie Yovanovitch, then the top U.S. envoy in Kyiv. \""He characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an 'Obama holdover' and associated with George Soros,\"" she planned to say. Yovanovitch was recalled from her position at Trump's direction earlier this year after the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his associates made unsubstantiated allegations that she was opposed to Trump. \""It was not clear to me at the time -- or now -- at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch,\"" Croft planned to say.\n\n\""Croft is expected to say she notified her boss, Fiona Hill, and another State Department official, George Kent, of Livingston's activities, and declare that she is 'not aware of any action that was taken in response,'\"" John Hudson and Elise Viebeck report. \""Livingston, a former Republican congressman from Louisiana, was chosen as the successor to Newt Gingrich as speaker of the House in 1999, but he declined the position after revelations of an extramarital affair. After leaving Congress, he formed the Livingston Group, one of Washington's most influential lobbying firms. His firm has represented clients in the Middle East and around the world, including political figures in Ukraine such as former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, according to Justice Department documents.\""\n\n-- Read Croft's opening statement here and Anderson's here.\n\n-- It's also important to emphasize that Vindman's concerns were broader than the July 25 call. Greg Miller looks into two White House meetings on July 10 with Ukrainian officials that have become central to the impeachment inquiry: \""One of the officials Trump had entrusted to pursue this agenda, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, was undeterred by the fierce opposition from [John] Bolton and others. He persisted in pressing Ukraine to commit to Trump's demands, convening a second meeting even after a spectacular blowup in the West Wing. ... After seeing Sondland outline political demands that Trump would reiterate in his July 25 call, Vindman said, he became worried that what he had witnessed was improper ...\n\n\""Sondland has testified that he didn't know of any Biden connection in Trump's demands for a Burisma investigation until much later, after the allegations in the whistleblower complaint became known. He has also said that no White House officials ever expressed any concern to him about his efforts to push Ukraine to commit to the Burisma probe. His lawyer declined to comment Tuesday after the release of Vindman's opening statement. Sondland's account is contradicted by statements from Hill and Vindman. Hill testified that she entered the Ward Room as the follow-up meeting was already underway and heard Sondland say the word 'Burisma' as he resumed pressing the Ukrainians to pursue certain investigations. She then ordered that meeting to an immediate close.\n\n\""Vindman said that Sondland used the downstairs meeting to press for 'investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma.' Vindman said he then confronted Sondland, saying that 'his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the [National Security Council] was going to get involved in or push.'\"" (The Fix created a Trump-Ukraine timeline to help keep straight what we've learned.)\n\n-- \""It's become a case of he said, they said\"" is how the Wall Street Journal puts it: Vindman and Hill, in addition to acting ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, have all contradicted to varying degrees what Sondland told investigators.\n\nWHIPPING TOMORROW'S VOTE:\n\n-- House Democrats unveiled the new procedures for the impeachment inquiry that they plan to vote on Thursday. Mike DeBonis reports: \""The resolution backed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) hands the lead role to the House Intelligence Committee and its chairman, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who would have broad latitude to organize extended questioning of potential public witnesses. Two other committees that have so far participated in the closed-door investigation into Trump's dealings with Ukraine -- Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform -- would not be permitted to directly participate in the open proceedings under the legislation. It also sets out for the first time the ability of House Republicans to make their own requests for testimony and documents, though those requests will be subject to a vote of the Democratic-majority committee -- a practice that matches the minority powers in the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.\n\n\""The House Rules Committee will debate and potentially amend the measure at a panel meeting Wednesday afternoon. ... By confining the public hearings to the Intelligence Committee and excluding the other two panels that have participated in the closed-door interviews, Democrats are in effect sidelining several of the GOP's most aggressive and outspoken defenders of Trump. They include Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio) and Mark Meadows (N.C.), who serve on the Oversight panel, as well as Rep. Lee Zeldin (N.Y.) of the Foreign Affairs Committee, who have led the public pushback to the Democratic impeachment effort in the House.\"" (Read the draft of the resolution and the House Judiciary Committee's draft procedures.)\n\n-- Pelosi expects all but a handful of her Democratic members to support the resolution. One holdout is Rep. Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.). \""What's going to happen in my mind, it's going to happen here in the House; it will go over to the Senate, and then he will believe that he has been exonerated,\"" Van Drew told reporters. \""He will still be the president, and he will still be the candidate -- a candidate who has been exonerated by the Senate.\""\n\n-- The latest on timing: House Democrats increasingly expect their effort to stretch well past Thanksgiving, possibly forcing a Senate trial into January or later. Michael Scherer and DeBonis report: \""House leaders had initially hoped to hold a floor vote before the Nov. 28 holiday so the Senate could hold trial before Christmas. But the surprising number of witnesses agreeing to testify behind closed doors ... over the past few weeks has extended the timeline and sparked a debate over whether prolonged impeachment proceedings are politically prudent. ... A January trial would also disrupt the final weeks of campaigning before the Iowa caucuses for candidates who are senators in Washington. ... The caucuses are Feb. 3.\""\n\n-- The timing depends, in part, on how quickly the courts move: The Justice Department got a reprieve yesterday afternoon when a federal appeals court said the Trump administration does not have to immediately release to the House Judiciary Committee certain grand jury materials from Bob Mueller's investigation. \""The court order means the issue will not be resolved before Nov. 5, when the final filing from the parties is due,\"" Ann Marimow reports. \""The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was responding to an emergency request from the Justice Department, which said in a court filing that it would be 'irreparably harmed' without a stay and that 'once the information is disclosed, it cannot be recalled and the confidentiality of the grand jury information will be lost for all time.' A three-judge panel paused the order pending further review but made clear it was not deciding the merits of the case.\"" (Read the court's order.)\n\n-- An Islamic State defector inside Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's hideout was critical to the success of the raid against the ISIS leader, U.S. officials said. Joby Warrick, Ellen Nakashima and Dan Lamothe report: \""The mole's detailed knowledge of Baghdadi's whereabouts as well as the room-by-room layout of his sanctuary proved to be critical in the Oct. 26 raid that ended with the death of the world's most-wanted terrorist, the officials said. The informant was present during the assault on Baghdadi's compound in the Syrian province of Idlib, and he was exfiltrated from the region two days later with his family. The man, whose nationality had not been revealed, is expected to receive some or all of the $25 million U.S. bounty that had been placed on Baghdadi's head, according to the officials. One official said he was a Sunni Arab who turned against the Islamic State because one of his relatives had been killed by the group. The Islamic State defector had been cultivated as an asset by the Syrian Democratic Forces.\""\n\n-- Out of the loop: \""Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney first learned about the U.S. military raid against ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after the operation was already underway,\"" NBC News reports. \""The extraordinary move by Trump to leave his chief of staff out of the most significant U.S. military operation against the world's most wanted terrorist since the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011 represents a major blow to Mulvaney, suggesting that he is increasingly sidelined inside the White House. The White House chief of staff typically would be central to such a momentous gambit for a president, coordinating logistics, public statements and notifications of congressional leaders and allies. Bill Daley, who was White House chief of staff during the bin Laden raid, was seated next to then-President Barack Obama as he monitored the raid ... Andrew Card, former President George W. Bush's longtime chief of staff, said the exclusion of Mulvaney from a moment of such magnitude in the presidency is difficult to grasp ... 'I'm baffled by it,' Card said. 'It's hard for me to imagine.'\""\n\n-- Dread descended upon Syria during the final hours of the cease-fire as American troops withdrew. Louisa Loveluck reports: \""In towns and cities, families debated, and sometimes fought, over whether, and where, to run. Selling their houses to pay for the help of unpredictable smugglers was one option. Moving closer to the Iraqi border, where thousands of refugees had already crossed, and then praying the violence wouldn't follow, was another. ... While U.S. troops withdrew to the south and out of the area where they'd long kept the peace, Russian military police moved in. Under an agreement reached last week between Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Russian forces would now patrol the border. At times, American and Russian armored vehicles passed on the road, each with their own red, white and blue flags flapping in the wind.\""\n\n-- Prime Minister Boris Johnson finally won support from lawmakers for an early election, setting up a December vote that will be dominated by Brexit. Karla Adam and William Booth report: \""Parliament will dissolve next week, and the parties will go into overdrive on their five-week campaigns. This will be the United Kingdom's first election in dark and dreary December since 1923 -- a time of year when Britons prefer Christmas parties to political party hustings. Voters will be offered some stark choices on Brexit, alongside the usual overenthusiastic promises, scary scenarios, misrepresentations and foggy numbers. Will the British double down on wanting to leave the European Union? Or will they change their minds and decide to stay in the largest trading club on the planet?\""\n\n-- The House voted overwhelmingly to recognize the \""genocide\"" of Armenians by the Ottoman Turks, a damning rebuke of Turkey in the wake of its invasion of Syria. From the AP: \""Historians estimate that up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed around World War I, and many scholars see it as the 20th century's first genocide. Turkey disputes the description, saying the toll has been inflated and considering those killed victims of a civil war. The nonbinding resolution passed 405-11 Tuesday. American lawmakers have been critical of Ankara's recent incursion against the Kurds along the Turkish-Syrian border.\""\n\n-- Chilling: The messaging service WhatsApp filed suit in federal court against the Israeli surveillance company NSO, claiming it acted illegally in helping governments hack into the mobile devices of more than 100 people worldwide, including journalists, human rights workers and women who had been the subject of online attacks. Targets, who also included religious figures and lawyers, were identified in 20 countries, according to the lawsuit. Craig Timberg and Jay Greene have more details: \""The suit amounted to a new legal front in attempts to curb the abuses of the burgeoning but almost entirely unregulated global surveillance industry. Victims of hacking previously have sued NSO in Israeli courts, but a technology company has not before pursued such legal action for using its services to help conduct spying operations on users.\n\n\""WhatsApp alleged that NSO helped government agencies deliver malicious software through seemingly harmless WhatsApp video calls, even if the targets never answered their phones. The malware was capable of initiating a powerful form of spying that included the ability to intercept communications, steal photos and other forms of data, activate microphones and cameras, track the locations of targets and more ... An NSO surveillance tool called Pegasus has been implicated in spying on Washington Post contributing writer Jamal Khashoggi before he was killed by people affiliated with Saudi Arabia's security services last year. A friend of Khashoggi, Omar Abdulaziz, has alleged in a lawsuit that his phone was infected with Pegasus without his knowledge and that the malicious software helped the Saudis snoop on Khashoggi.\""\n\nWhatsApp says in a blog post that the company, which is owned by Facebook, believes NSO violated U.S. and California law, as well as the terms of service for WhatsApp. \""At WhatsApp, we believe people have a fundamental right to privacy and that no one else should have access to your private conversations, not even us,\"" writes Will Cathcart, head of WhatsApp, in an op-ed for The Post. NSO rejected the allegations in the lawsuit, saying its technology is used by governments and law enforcement to fight terrorism. \""In the strongest possible terms, we dispute today's allegations and will vigorously fight them,\"" the Israeli company said in a statement forwarded by a Washington public relations agency.\n\n-- Scientists tripled their estimates of the number of people threatened by rising seas. Chris Mooney reports: \""The upshot of the study is that 110 million people worldwide live below the high-tide level -- including many partly protected by sea walls or other infrastructure, as in New Orleans. Even under a scenario of very modest climate change, that number will rise to 150 million in 2050 and 190 million by 2100. If climate change and sea level rise follow a worse path, as many as 340 million people living below the high-tide level could be in peril, to say nothing of how many could be affected by floods and extreme events.\""\n\n-- Climate activist Greta Thunberg declined the 2019 Nordic Council Environment Prize, saying the world needs more action on climate change and fewer awards.

'Every dollar amount, no matter how small or large' ... is important, Hodges, founder of Advance Financial, one of the country's largest payday lenders, said during a 48-minute webcast ... 'For example, I've gone to Ronna McDaniel and said, \""Ronna, I need help on something,\"" ' Hodges said, referring to the chair of the Republican National Committee. 'She's been able to call over to the White House and say, \""Hey, we have one of our large givers. They need an audience. ...

'That's how those things work.'\n\n\""The White House declined to comment for this report. Trump's reelection committee did not return a call for comment. In a statement, Mike Reed, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said: 'Part of the RNC's job is sharing what we hear from supporters across the country with party leaders. We often will connect our supporters with other Republican officials when they have a message they would like to pass along.'\"" Note that this is not a denial.\n\n-- Rep. Bradley Byrne (R), a leading candidate for Senate in Alabama, warned Jeff Sessions that he will not back out of the race if the former attorney general tries to reclaim his old seat. Seung Min Kim reports: \""Both Byrne and Sessions draw their main base of political support from the Mobile area, triggering some speculation among insiders in the state that Byrne would bow out of the Senate race and run again for his old House seat if Sessions wages a bid. But Byrne said in an interview Tuesday that Sessions's entry would not make 'any difference to me' and vowed to stay in the race regardless. Then, unprompted, Byrne referenced what would almost certainly be Sessions's biggest political liability should he run again for the Senate. 'The president is very angry with Jeff. I think the president will be very vocal against him,' Byrne said. 'For Jeff's sake, I don't want that. But I think that's the reality of what he's facing.'\""\n\n-- George Papadopoulos, the former Trump foreign policy adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents, plans to run for the House seat being vacated by Rep.

Three Republicans are also running, the Associated Press reported.\""\n\n-- Bernie Sanders and Warren are in a close race among likely voters in New Hampshire's Democratic primary, according to a new CNN poll. Sanders pulls 21 percent, while Warren follows him at 18 percent, which is within the margin of error. Biden stands slightly behind at 15 percent, while Pete Buttigieg is the final candidate to reach double digits with 10 percent. Three candidates landed 5 percent in the poll - Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Andrew Yang. Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), who polled at 9 percent in a July New Hampshire poll, received just 3 percent support now. The poll shows that the race remains very fluid, and many people have not made up their minds.\n\n-- Biden's cash-strapped campaign is talking to top donors about ways to beef up fundraising in the next quarter. Ideas include spending more on social media platforms. From CNBC: \""People familiar with the campaign's deliberations say boosting online efforts doesn't necessarily represent a major shift in strategy. Yet several of Biden's fundraisers believe that the campaign needs to improve its appeal to online donors. ... Biden's campaign has been behind in spending on Facebook ads that often entice contributors. Since he entered the race in April, Biden has spent $2.5 million on Facebook. Warren's campaign has spent $2.7 million and Sanders has bought $3.1 million in ads.\""\n\n-- Biden's campaign warned a newly formed super PAC not to attack the former vice president's Democratic competitors. \""Our campaign would be extremely frustrated if the super PAC was used to attack other Democrats,\"" Biden's campaign manager Greg Schultz told reporters Tuesday, per CBS News.\n\n-- Sanders has gained key endorsements from some of the country's most powerful Latinas, leading some to believe that he might have a shot in capturing the Latinx vote, which has huge sway potential but low turnout numbers. From Politico: \""Sanders' star support from prominent Latinas 'gives him barrio cred, street cred for this old white Jewish dude who is running for president,' said Domingo Garcia, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens. Garcia backed the Vermont senator in 2016 but, as president of LULAC, has refrained from endorsing a candidate in the current primary. ... There's also the reality that Sanders probably can't win the Democratic nomination without Latinos, since his campaign is relying on a strong finish in states such as Nevada and California.

Ben Terris profiles the duo: \""The Bennets are the anti-Trump dynasty, institutionalists at a time when their very institutions -- Capitol Hill, the mainstream media -- have come under attack. To their critics on the left, they are mealy-mouthed centrists, focused on giving a platform to 'both sides,' for whom 'civility' is just another cudgel used by elites to cling to power. To their friends and supporters, they are what a politician and a newspaperman are supposed to look and act like, brothers in the mold of the Kennedys, idealists fighting for what's right.

LOS REYES,0,"Joshua Ryan Joles, the CEO of LLC Wholesale Supply, LLC, Mohammad Mehdi Salemi, the CEO of Wholesalers Group, Inc. and Wholesalers Group, LLC, and bank account holders Angel Caminero Alvarez and Leonides Herrera were indicted on charges of money laundering, committing violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and mail fraud, related to their alleged participation in a scheme to sell diverted pharmaceuticals to unwitting pharmacies and consumers.\n\nU.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan for the Southern District of Florida stated, \The allegations set forth in this scheme strike at the peace of mind we should all feel when we buy prescription drugs from a pharmacy. We all expect and should rest assured knowing that the drugs we are buying are safe, effective, and properly stored and handled. Today and whenever necessary, we will continue to strike back at those who seek to profit by robbing the public of that peace of mind through brazen, criminal schemes.\""\n\nAccording to the indictment, Joles and Salemi are alleged to have purchased and distributed millions of dollars in diverted pharmaceuticals, which are prescription drugs illegally trafficked in a secondary or underground market (Case No. 19-20674-CR-Gayles). The indictment explains that the diverted pharmaceuticals are not controlled substances, but rather, high priced medical drugs used to treat such conditions as mental illness, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and cancer. They are branded drugs, produced by the original pharmaceutical developers as opposed to lower-priced generic drugs, but are acquired unlawfully -- through fraud, pharmacy burglaries, and cargo thefts.\n\nJoles and Salemi are alleged to have acquired such drugs in large quantities, at a cost well-below normal wholesale prices, and then introduced the diverted drugs back into the legitimate marketplace. The indictment further alleges that, because the pharmaceutical distribution system is regulated, to get diverted drugs back into the market, the diverters must, among other things, establish seemingly legitimate wholesale companies and bank accounts, produce fraudulent paperwork, and professionally package and ship the medicines to their pharmacy customers. Joles and Salemi are alleged to have produced or caused the production of fraudulent paperwork, including falsified pedigrees, which are documents that identify the products and batch numbers of pharmaceuticals, describe their dates of manufacture and origin, indicate who purchased them, show when and where they were shipped, how they were purchased, and other information needed to trace them through the marketing chain. Utilizing these false pedigrees, Joles and Salemi allegedly sold or caused the sale of these diverted pharmaceuticals to unsuspecting pharmacies and their patients.\n\nAdditionally, Joles and Salemi, with the assistance of Alvarez and Herrera, are alleged to have laundered money as part of this scheme, including conducting financial transactions to promote the carrying on of the scheme and to conceal the nature, source and ownership of the money.\n\n\""This investigation into a South Florida based drug diversion group spanned the entire country, from California to Puerto Rico,\"" said George L. Piro, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Miami Field Office. \""It is truly an example of multiple federal and state agencies working together with private industry to take out of circulation thousands of bottles of potentially dangerous drugs, and also disrupt a money laundering scheme that moved millions of dollars a month through South Florida.\""\n\n\""U.S. consumers are put at risk when prescription drugs are diverted from the FDA-regulated supply chain and then returned clandestinely for distribution to the public, as there is no longer any assurance that the products are safe and effective for their intended uses,\"" said Justin D. Green, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations' (FDA-OCI) Miami Field Office. \""We will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who put the public health at risk.\""\n\nHerrera was arrested this morning and will have his initial appearance Monday afternoon, Oct. 21, 2019, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Alicia M. Otazo-ENTITY. Joles and Salemi will have their initial appearances on later dates. Alvarez remains a fugitive.\n\nThe prosecution was part of Operation Southern Hospitality, one of the ongoing efforts by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF), a partnership between federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. The OCDETF mission is to identify, investigate, and prosecute high level members of drug trafficking and money laundering enterprises, bringing together the combined expertise and unique abilities of federal, state and local law enforcement.\n\nU.S. Attorney Fajardo Orshan praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and FDA-OCI. She also thanked the U.S. Attorney's Offices for the Northern District of California, the District of Arizona, and the Western District of Washington, the FBI's Los Angeles, Phoenix and Seattle Field Offices, the U.S. Marshal's Service in Miami, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Attorney General's Office of Statewide Prosecution in Fort Lauderdale, and Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for their invaluable assistance.\n\nThe prosecution of this case is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Frank Tamen and Walter M. Norkin. Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicole Grosnoff is handling the asset forfeiture aspects of this matter.\n\nThe charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.\n\nRelated court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida at www.flsd.uscourts.gov or on http://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov."
LOS REYES,0,"The idea for the Annenberg Space for Photography's current exhibit W/ALLS: Defend, Divide, and The Divine came about when curator Dr. Jen Sudul Edwards and the space's director Katie Hollander contemplated the symbolic connection between this year's 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the debate over President Trump's proposed expansion of the U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\n\For many people, the fall of the Berlin Wall was a formative moment in their lives,\"" says Edwards, who's a curator of contemporary art at the Mint Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina. \""It was this momentous occasion and celebration of humanity coming together. It really opened up this idea of a global community. They saw it as an anomaly that can never be repeated. Yet walls are going up more rapidly than ever before. It's such a weird reversal of course.\""\n\nSadly, Trump's ideas about how to guard America against illegal immigration, terrorism, and crime are a sign of the times the world over.

In 1989, there were 15 major border walls in the world; now there are 77.\n\nAmi Vitale\n\nThis proliferation of walls has its historical precedent; and the more than 70 photographers in the display explore the function, psychology, and ideology behind barricades throughout thousands of years as ways of not only keeping people out, or in, but of perpetuating fear, hate, and ignorance.\n\n\""People don't think about how or why we got to where we are, and the ramifications of our actions now,\"" says Edwards. \""This has been human behavior for millennia.\""\n\nThe walls depicted in the collection, which is organized into six themes - \""Delineation, Defense, Deterrent, The Divine, Decoration, and The Invisible\"" - span centuries and nearly every continent, from the Great Wall of China and Hadrian's Wall. to the Israel-Palestine border and the \""peace walls\"" in Belfast, Ireland, which divided Protestant and Catholic areas. Barriers have been erected to protect lands during wars and conflicts or to limit trade. They have been meant to keep \""undesirable elements\"" at bay or in containment, whether Japanese Americans in internment camps or Jews in Polish ghettos during WWII, or undocumented immigrants crossing the deserts of North America today.\n\nPhoto by Gina Clyne.

LOS REYES,0,"It's the kind of thing they worry about in third world countries, not in America... right? RIGHT?\n\nWe have 911. We have police officers. We have law and order. But what if we didn't... because there was such a shortage?\n\nWhile enacting your duties as a police officer, that alone has a myriad of dangers. One of the most avoidable dangers associated with the role is when you're entrenched in an understaffed department.\n\nAcross the country... those shortages are getting worse and worse, no doubt as the war on police by both criminal and legislators ramps up.\n\nThe Hagerstown Police Department in Maryland is experiencing just that scenario and is causing concern within the Chief of Police. It's just one example of the challenges departments across the country are facing.\n\nHagerstown Police Chief Paul Kifer stated on Tuesday that the officers within his department are starting to get burned out coping with the realities of working within an understaffed department. Considering the aforementioned, the Chief is starting to worry that someone is going to wind up getting hurt because of the circumstances.\n\nPolice Chief Kifer had informed Mayor Bob Bruchey, who was elected back in 2016, and the Hagerstown City Council during a work session earlier in the month that the staffing levels have been below \bare bones\"" at times. So far, the department has shifted work schedules in an attempt to deal with the situation.\n\nThe police department is currently afforded to have a force of 112 officers. At the time being, Chief Kifer mentioned that there are 100 employees on the department's payroll, but some of those individuals are in a police training academy currently or they're prepping to enroll into the academy soon.\n\nThis leaves the department with about 88 \""street ready\"" officers on staff, which when taking into account the varying shifts that they'll cover leaves them with 15 officers that can be dispatched at any time.\n\nThe 15 officers on any given shift is how Chief Kifer defines as \""bare bones\"" and the Chief would much prefer having the ability to dispatch 17 officers at any time.\n\nChief Kifer mentioned that the department's peak hours for calls runs usually from 1 p.m. to 11 p.m., and there is usually a spike in officers dispatched for calls around 7 p.m. He has rearranged work shifts that place up to 16 officers on duty between 2 p.m. and 10 p.m., which inevitably pulls resources from various other shifts.\n\nWhen pondering the trouble and dangerous circumstances, Chief Kifer stated:\n\nWhile the general public that the department serves is somewhat oblivious to the detrimental effects the understaffing is causing, Chief Kifer speculated that they're likely unaware since the city officers are \""killing it every day\"" despite the current staffing.\n\nHowever, meeting staffing demands when you're short staffed typically doesn't come cheap when looking at the overall overtime costs the department is accruing. Chief Kifer had informed Mayor Bruchey that the department's overtime costs are running close to one-million dollars at this point.\n\nOf course, depending on how you look at the total cost of ownership of onboarding new officers, the overtime may not be that expensive after all. According to some of the local fire and emergency services officials in the city, they have said that paying employees overtime is holistically cheaper than hiring additional personnel when considering costs associated with benefits and additional equipment.\n\nCouncilman Kristin Aleshire sympathized with the department's situation, saying he'd heard in a recent radio news program that Baltimore has to recruit about 1,000 officers a year. The Councilman fathomed that the demand isolated in that portion of Maryland likely makes it harder for Hagerstown to find qualified officers.\n\nChief Kifer also noted that his department's situation is not unique, and that there's several departments across the country that are hurting to bring on qualified officers as well.\n\nMayor Bruchey said earlier in the month while speculating on one of the possible causes of being short staffed:\n\nChief Kifer also noted that there's other unavoidable obstacles challenging the department staffing shortage like retirements. Still, Chief Kifer said he hopes to have a force of between 107 and 110 officers by the end of next year. Even if there was a sudden surge of qualified applicants, the training academy at Hagerstown Community College which is co-run alongside with the Washington County Sheriff's Office, requires approximately six months' time to have an individual complete the required training.\n\nCarroll Braun of the Local 3373 of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees contributed to the list of possible determents to ponder with regard to the short staffing back in in April, speculating that the department's low starting pay of $40,106 is the main reason the city has trouble attracting new officers.\n\nJust last month, we reported about how departments so short staffed that they're hiring new cops with gang affiliations in some cases.\n\nAre staffing shortages and unmet recruiting goals a reason to overlook gang affiliations?\n\nOne Connecticut police department is doing exactly that by defending the hiring of an officer who was identified in background checks as someone who associated with known gang members and displayed gang-affiliated hand signals.\n\nNew Haven police issued a statement saying that the discovery was made after the officer's employment with Connecticut's Department of Correction began and during a background check as he went through the process to become a city officer.\n\nWhile the officer's name was not released, Chief Otoniel ENTITY said the officer underwent a \""laborious and intensive background check, psychological examination, drug test and polygraph test.\""\n\nFormer Chief Anthony Campbell did NOT think the officer was a suitable candidate for hire, but the Board of Police Commissioners approved the hire.\n\nENTITY said the officer is currently a member of the department in good standing.\n\nBut what if it is more than one gang member? What if it is an entire gang imbedded inside an agency, actively recruiting from within?\n\nLET dealt with that question in an article in July.\n\nThe law enforcement community is simply a microcosm of our greater society. The problems and issues we see in our communities will most likely be present in police departments, sheriff's offices and federal agencies. Issues include, alcoholism, drug use, abuse, theft, suicide and yes, even murder. But among the things that should never be present at any level, much less at a larger degree, is gang membership and activity.\n\nIt is that very alleged activity that has led the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to launch a probe into multiple gangs hidden within the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.\n\nThe Banditos, Spartans, Regulators, and Reapers are literal gangs that are claimed to exist within the Los Angeles law enforcement agency. The investigation started after allegations of abuse by the Banditos in March.\n\nAll members of the Banditos have tattoos of a skeleton wearing a sombrero, bandolier, and pistol. Allegations against these deputies include using gang tactics to recruit young Latino deputies, and punishing those who reject their advances with physical attacks.\n\nAn unidentified source told the Los Angeles Times that FBI agents:\n\nFour deputies were put on paid leave following the aforementioned allegations. Sheriff Alex Villanueva minimized the danger, calling the gangs a \""cultural norm,\"" and believes that any problems with these types of activities were eliminated as a result of previous investigations.\n\nCultural norm? Gang activity is being explained away as a cultural norm? I grew up in west Texas. Our cultural norms were things like listening to country music, going to church on Sundays and high school football on Friday nights. Never was violence inside of law enforcement simply explained away as a cultural norm. Law enforcement officials are held to a higher standard, and cannot simply sweep things under the rug.\n\nIn the last decade, there have been accusations against 'gang member' deputies of police brutality, even breaking the bones of suspects in their custody as an initiation ritual, allowing the deputies to be deemed worthy of their inclusion.\"" Sheriff Villanueva has chalked that fault up to previous leadership, saying the gangs \""ran roughshod\"" over past sheriffs.\n\nThe latest allegations stemmed from a party last September. New deputies working in East L.A. were celebrating the completion of their probationary period with the department.\n\nIt was at the end of this party when several veteran deputies showed up that things went south.\n\nDid you know that Law Enforcement Today has a private new home for those who support emergency responders and veterans? It's called LET Unity, and it's where we share the untold stories of those patriotic Americans. Every penny gets reinvested into giving these heroes a voice. Check it out today.\n\nAccording to legal documents filed against the county by seven deputies, the men belonged to the Banditos.\n\nThe claims are a precursor to a civil suit, which will seek tens of millions of dollars from the county for failing to address the hostile work environment the Banditos are alleged to have created.\n\nThe evening in question ended in violence when the Banditos are accused of attacking several of the new deputies. One rookie said he was thrown to the ground and punched in the face before being knocked unconscious. Another recalled being choked to the point of passing out.\n\nThe Sheriff's Department issued a statement this past Thursday that said it would not tolerate any form of hazing or harassment within the organization.\n\nRon Hernandez is the president of the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, the union that represents rank-and-file deputies. He said the group would withhold specific comment out of respect for the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe allegations are the latest for a department that has struggled for years to address numerous examples of secretive, gang-like deputy societies accused of committing abuses against inmates, fellow deputies and while on patrol.\n\nAccording to the L.A. Times, in July last year, then-Sheriff Jim McDonnell launched what he said would be a comprehensive study of deputy cliques after The Times revealed that a Compton station deputy involved in the fatal shooting of a black man had testified that he and as many as 20 of his colleagues had matching skull tattoos.\n\nThat inquiry went unfinished when Villanueva, a former lieutenant in the department, unseated McDonnell and took office in early December.\n\nVillanueva, who has drawn fire from critics who worry he is rolling back reforms meant to curb abuse by deputies, has at times defended deputies with station tattoos, saying they're honorable people. But he has criticized previous administrations for allowing a broader culture of hazing to fester in the department.\n\nIn comments shortly after taking office, he blamed station captains and other top officials for failing to stop a work culture of \""unchecked hazing\"" that allowed cliques to form and grow.\n\nSome deputies have defended the tattoos they share with others in their stationas a source of benign camaraderie and a way to boost morale. Some have also said they have a free-speech right to wear them.\n\nThe recent allegations are not the first against the Banditos. In 2014, the county paid a female deputy assigned to the East L.A. station $1.5 million to settle a lawsuit, in which she claimed she had been physically and mentally harassed by some of the clique's 80 members after refusing to go along with its \""traditions and initiation rituals.\""\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Hilda Solis, a member of the Board of Supervisors, said she was \""disappointed and dismayed\"" at the latest allegations.\n\nIs a lack of staffing and within police departments and sheriff's offices a valid reason to hire unqualified candidates? Is a lessening of requirements and abilities worth sacrificing\n\nWe must ask, because the shortage has begun. We see this from Dallas to Portland to Minneapolis and cities and towns in between. Let's start in Minneapolis.\n\nThe city is facing a critical police shortage as their crime rate continues to climb, with no real help or relief in sight. According to the NY Daily News:\n\nOver the past several weeks, news stories about brutal assaults and robberies have been flooding the new channels regarding Minneapolis. Complaints of 911 calls not having officers dispatched to respond to these crimes have risen, and a lack of staffing is clearly to blame.\n\nWant to know how bad that shortage is?\n\nLast year, the department was unable to immediately send a police car to 6,776 priority one emergencies.\n\nAmong those calls were shots fired, stabbings and sexual assaults.\n\nAccording to police, priority one calls involve \""an imminent threat to personal safety, or the loss or damage to property exists.\""\n\nIt gets worse. There's what's called \""priority zero\"" calls - of which police were unable to respond to seven of them.\n\nThey included a baby not breathing and a fellow officer facing imminent danger. Those calls, according to police, \""include those situations where a known crisis exists that threatens the life of an individual. This is the highest possible priority and the fastest possible response is desired. The MECC objective is to have squads en route to the call within 30 seconds of receipt by the dispatcher.\""\n\nAlondra Cano is the chair of the city's safety committee. Cano said the city council acknowledges there is a crisis and promises it's investing and diversifying its force to better represent the community.\n\nMany of the beatings that have been seen on news networks show groups of people ganging up on individuals and beating them beyond the point where they can defend themselves, at times beating them unconscious, and taking their belongings.\n\nMany of these attacks have been caught on camera as the groups are bold enough to carry out these assaults in the open without what seems a worry of the police or legal action.\n\nA video recording showed \""a group of suspects is seen on surveillance videos repeatedly punching and kicking a man in a daytime attack outside Target Field. At various points in the video, they run and jump on him, ride over him with a bicycle, take off his shoes and pants, beat him with a belt and throw what appears to be potted plants at him.\""\n\nAs reported by Fox News in a Fox & Friends interview Thursday September 19th, Lt. Bob Kroll of the Minneapolis Police Department, and the president of the Minnesota Police Officers Union, told news anchors:\n\nDue to a lack of police staffing and being able to respond to and investigate these calls - and also a lack of city support - incidents similar to this are likely continue to happen. Lt. Kroll explained:\n\nThe police officers in the city have had to handle the population explosion, without seeing any growth of their department. WCCO news reported that Police Chief Medaria Arradondo had originally asked to add 400 officers by 2025.\n\nThe mayor, however, explained that was an unrealistic expectation due to budget limitations. With this response, the Chief presented his need for 14 new officers to the Minneapolis City Council, and while some on the council felt 14 was not enough, they did agree that the need was there.\n\nWCCO reported that \""the 14 officers will include eight neighborhood outreach, three in the traffic unit and three investigators.\""\n\nHowever, Lt. Krolls feels that applicant pool for viable police candidates is ever shrinking, and he \""estimates applicants are about one-fifth the number they were around 30 years ago.\""\n\nThere will be another committee meeting on September 23where the discussion continues. Currently only two suspects from the multiple attacks have been taken into custody, and the investigations are ongoing.\n\nIn the meantime, the Plumas County sheriff's Department in California is facing criticism for a new policy that has been initiated -- their officers will no longer respond to suicide calls.\n\nCarol Quinn learned of the recently enacted policy when she had contacted the Sheriff's Department to intervene before her brother could take his own life.\n\nCarol's brother, George Quinn, 63, lived alone with his Maine Coon Cat in a remote Northern California community. The day he decided to take his own life he sent a text message to his sister, apologizing to her, and advising her to contact police.\n\nLiving over an hour away in Reno, Carol made a phone call to the Sheriff's office, hoping they would respond and save her brother's life. But Carol was shocked to learn that deputies would not be responding to intervene.\n\nCarol was told by the department, that they would not be responding as there was no way to be certain that the situation would not end in \""suicide by cop\"".\n\nWhile Plumas County may be the department involved in bringing this type of policy national attention, they are not the only department in the state of California that are considering changing their response policies to reflect this.\n\nLarge departments like Los Angeles and San Francisco have units that were specifically created to respond to calls of distressed or suicidal individuals. They typically consist of an officer and a mental health professional. A unit that has the tools to deal with the potential mental health aspects of this type of call.\n\nSmaller departments do not have the funds or the staffing to put together these types of teams. Rather than risking the lives of officers or innocent bystanders, and potentially creating situations where officers may be forced to take the life of a distressed individual-if there are no direct threats to other individuals, or no crimes being committed-they will no longer respond.\n\nAs reported by the Los Angeles Times:\n\n\""In a 2009 study of more than 700 officer-involved shootings nationwide, 36% of incidents were determined to be attempts at provoking officers to use deadly force.\""\n\nWhile some critics feel that, 'suicide by cop' is only a mean to justify police brutality, other studies have shown up to half of the calls where police respond to a suicidal person, they are forced to take the persons life.\n\nEven though there is criticism of this type of change in the way departments respond to these calls to service, there are many who defend law enforcement's need to rethink how these situations are handled.\n\nPsychiatry Professor, John Reid Meloy, from UC San Diego defends policy changes stating to the Los Angeles times:\n\nThis is a call to service that comes in to departments all too often.\n\nPlumas County may be one of the first departments in California to officially enact this type of policy but California Police Chiefs Association President, Ron Lawrence, has acknowledge that other departments have less formal but similar ways of handling these types of calls.\n\nNot responding to the need for their assistance may go against everything officers intuitively feel but Lawrence went on to explain to the Times reporter, \""...we have just learned through evolution that sometimes police presence is not the answer.\""\n\nWhile there are officers that wonder, what if it was someone that they cared for that was making the call for help in a situation like this, a greater discussion about mental and behavioral health has been initiated because of these new policy changes. Admittedly, police alone cannot hope to resolve the growing need for response to suicidal individuals.\n\nLarger departments in California are putting funds and greater efforts behind 'disengagement' response policies. A collaborative effort between officers and mental health clinicians that are dispatched together to a call of a suicidal person, have proven to work to diffuse the situation and end where the suspect receives the mental health help that they need.\n\nThis type of efforts between first responders and mental health providers may be the ideal situation for these types of calls, but many of the smaller departments do not have the ability to put these teams together, just based on geographical location alone.\n\nMono County Sheriff's office near Yosemite National Park is one of those very departments. Ingrid Braun, sheriff of the department explained to the Los Angeles Times, \""the nearest emergency mental health bed in her county is five hours south in Bakersfield, and the county currently has no behavioral health practitioners who can respond to urgent calls.\""\n\nHowever not responding to suicide calls is not an ideal solution for her department, so she is working on having medics respond to these types of calls along with officers.\n\nThere is acknowledgement that the greater discussions need to take place amongst officers and mental health professionals to combat the growing need for officers to respond to suicidal individuals. Braun brings to light that, the response of just officers alone to these types of calls may not be the best way to handle the situation, \""If you call because you are bottoming out and you need help, we send men with guns...'\n\nThe executive director of the non-profit, Suicide Awareness Voices of Education, Dan Reidenberg, also acknowledges that there are risks to officers responding to these types of calls, but no response at all is not the answer either. Reidenberg stated to the Times:\n\nThere are growing fears that the lack of response by law enforcement to these types of calls will rapidly increase the rate of suicides -- which has already been on the rise in recent years.\n\nAs for Carol Quinn, she and her friend Pat Costin, ultimately made the hour-long drive to her brother's house the day police would told her they would not respond to Carol's request to intervene in her brother's potential suicide. Pat was the one to find George Quinn hanging from the rafters of his wood shop by a chain-dead.\n\nAfter discovering the body, Pat contacted the Plumas Co. Sheriff's Department to report that, it was \""safe for them to come now.\"" Pat went on to further explain that, unlike police officers, he was never trained to handle the situation that he walked into.\n\nPat explained that the images of his friend hanging haunt him, and he is happy that Carol did not need to see what he had found.While he and Carol are both police supporters, they disagree with the nonresponse policy, something needs to change.\n\nIn April, Portland, Oregon lost a huge chunk of its police presence.\n\nClackamas County Sheriff Craig Roberts wrote an email to his deputies, stating his concern for their safety.\n\nThe city of Portland is largely patrolled by the Portland Police Bureau and receives support from neighboring counties like Clackamas Sheriff's Department. With this decision, remaining officers in the area will no doubt feel the stress of being understaffed.\n\nThe announcement came as Portland was bracing for its next protest - May Day, where a protest for immigrant and worker's rights was set for downtown. In 2017, 25 people were arrested in the gathering after the rally turned into a violent clash.\n\nDemonstrators were charged with disorderly conduct, arson, theft, assault, vandalism and more. Officers maintaining order at the march were quickly attacked by left wing anarchists who threw full cans of soda and other projectiles.\n\nThe decision to stop responding to routine calls was made following a statement released by the Portland Police Association.\n\nDue to the overwhelming 'anti-police' attitudes in the city of Portland, some officials are stepping in to say, 'no more.' Enter - Sheriff Craig Roberts.\n\nPortland Mayor Ted Wheeler is concerned. He asked Sheriff Roberts to wait to enact his decision until after the May Day protest, but failed.\n\n\""False narratives, knee jerk political reactions, along with personal and political agendas have created a hostile work environment and made it an impossible task to effectively police in the City of Portland. Our police officers are frustrated. They deserve better. They deserve to work in an environment where they can perform their primary function -- keeping our communities safe -- with the support of City Hall. Similarly, our communities are frustrated. They deserve better. They deserve safe, clean streets. It's that simple,\"" the PPA's post read.\n\nPortland officer have repeatedly been told to stand down during past protests. Mayor Wheeler tends to side with the liberal agenda, taking protests as just people expressing their feelings. But things have gotten violent a number of times.\n\nLET columnist James Lewis is a former LEO and served in the Air Force. He used to live in a suburb outside Portland, and is upset to see the way it has changed over the years. One of the biggest issues in the area?\n\nThe Police Commissioner also sits as the City Manager. Conflict of interest? Many say yes. The same individual that is supposed to be the head of local law enforcement is also making daily decisions about city works, budgets and more. Portland heads even consulted the head of Black Lives Matter when creating the 2019 contract for police.\n\nLewis says companies like Intel and Nike drew lot's of families from California up to the city. Those families stayed, thus leading to a big change in culture.\n\nThe Washington County Sheriff's Department also made a similar move in February, announcing they would be providing less support for Portland calls.\n\nSheriff's Roberts' email to his deputies can be read in full below.\n\nSheriff's Office Change in Services within the City of Portland\n\nTo all Clackamas County Sheriff's Office employees: I want to give you an important update on changes to services we provide in the City of Portland.\n\nAs you know, our command staff and executive team have been actively assessing the risk of your work within the City of Portland.\n\nRecently, Undersheriff Brandenburg met with many of our deputies assigned to answering routine calls for service in the City of Portland to listen to their concerns related to safety. I've also had conversations with other city, state and federal law enforcement leaders, including Portland Police Chief Outlaw. Lastly, I've taken into account the Portland Police Association's concerns outlined in their April 8 statement, which you can read here. As I said in my earlier email on this topic, I will not place you at unnecessary personal and professional risk.\n\nAs a result of these and other assessments, the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office will pull back all staff responding to calls for services within the City of Portland in the coming weeks. Those actions are as follows:\n\nWe are working with TriMet to develop a new Intergovernmental Agreement that will reassign deputies to meet the public safety needs of citizens accessing TriMet within Clackamas County. We intend to continue assigning one sergeant and six deputies to provide timely responses for law enforcement services and maintain passenger safety.\n\nWith respect to deployment of special teams, we will evaluate requests for assistance on a case-by-case basis. This applies to SWAT, the Crisis Negotiations Team (CNT), and the Rapid Response Team (RRT/CERT).\n\nWe will continue our participation on the United States Marshals Fugitive Task Force and the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force.\n\nNo changes will be made to operations involving Corrections staff who work the Electronic Home Detention Program, Parole and Probation staff who supervise clients in the City of Portland, and the Metropolitan Explosive Disposal Unit (MEDU). All will continue with their regular duties.\n\nI don't make these decisions lightly. I appreciate and commend the difficult work Portland Police officers do every day, and I also commend Portland Police Chief Outlaw for her leadership in a very difficult environment. I admire her commitment to improving public safety and community relations.\n\nAs Sheriff, your safety and the safety of Clackamas County residents remain my top priorities. Our work is dangerous enough without adding unnecessary risk when responding to calls for services in the City of Portland.\n\nI also want to make this clear: We will always respond to help any officer from any agency in immediate need of assistance."
LOS REYES,0,"In what could be one of the most gruesome ways to lose your life, a young mother was made to helplessly watch home invaders saw off her young son and daughter's heads before being murdered herself.\n\nFive-year old A'Laylaih Fisher was stabbed 20 times before police say her killer Michael Collins, 26, tried to remove her head. They say Collins then stabbed A'Layaih's four-year old brother Elijah 14 times before decapitating him at the family's home in Little Rock, Arkansas, in December 2017.\n\nThe youngsters' mother, Mariah Cunningham, 24, was allegedly held down by Collins' accomplice, William Burnell Alexander, 23, and forced to watch before she too was stabbed to death. Prosecutor Barbara Mariana revealed the horrific details during the opening day of Collins' capital murder trial Wednesday.\n\nShe told jurors it had only taken him 20 minutes to 'annihilate' Mariah and her children after he and half-brother Alexander robbed the family's apartment. Jurors at Pulaski County Court heard how the family had been slaughtered just for a TV, Xbox and Cunningham's broken-down Honda, which was abandoned shortly afterwards. Collins and Alexander mistakenly believed the mother was wealthy.\n\nCollins had previously lodged with Mariah, with Mariana telling jurors the killings were:\n\nDespite a capital murder charge carrying a maximum sentence of death, Collins will not be executed now that he has been convicted.\n\nThe court heard how Collins allegedly fled to Chicago after the killings, with local cops directing US Marshals to an address where he was staying. There, federal agents are said to have found the suspect asleep on a couch, next to a pair of Adidas trainers splattered with his alleged victims' blood.\n\nCollins was taken into custody - and is then said to have confessed to what he'd done to a fellow inmate after claiming Mariah's ghost had haunted him. That cellmate - bank robber Marino Bernard Scott, 47, came forward to police to share how Collins had been wracked with guilt by what he is accused of doing.\n\nProsecutor Marinara said:\n\nCollins denied the charges he faces, with his defense attorney Katherine Streett yet to unveil his version of events. The jury deliberated less than a half an hour before finding Collins guilty of a triple murder.\n\nProsecutors were able to convince a jury that Collins, along with half-brother Alexander, traveled to the Little Rock home of Mariah Cunningham in December 2017 with grisly intent.\n\nThe bodies were found by Cunningham's 78-year-old grandmother, who had gone to the house after her phone calls were not returned.\n\nPolice found bleach on the bodies and a steak knife believed to be the murder weapon in the bathtub. Although the prosecution had no witnesses, they brought the case based on material evidence.\n\nArkansas detective Terry McDaniel connected Collins with the victim and was able to determine he had left the state. He alerted U.S. marshals and five days after the crime, they found him in Chicago. A search found blood on Collins' shoes. DNA testing revealed that the blood matched all three victims.\n\nIn addition, Collins' cellmate, Marino Bernard Scott, testified that during the 30 days they had been in jail, Collins had confessed to him that he had gone to Cunningham's house to see if she would give him money. When she refused, he began to \punish\"" her children.\n\nCollins did not testify at the trial, and his public defense attorney only presented a single piece of evidence to argue that the victims' DNA was present on the shoes because he had briefly lived with the family.\n\nIn April, prosecutors announced that they would seek the death penalty in the case. However, they then waived that request at the start of the trial. The guilty verdict will result in Collins spending life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nAlexander is scheduled to stand trial next month.\n\nDid you know that Law Enforcement Today has a private new home for those who support emergency responders and veterans? It's called LET Unity, and it's where we share the untold stories of those patriotic Americans. Every penny gets reinvested into giving these heroes a voice. Check it out today.\n\nHere's another story that largely flew under the radar in the mainstream media. Probably because it involves two allegedly illegal MS-13 gang members committing murder in a sanctuary city.\n\nKing County prosecutors have filed murder charges against two men in King County, Washington. They say they men killed and dismembered a 16-year-old boy in Auburn last month, then tossed his body in the Green River.\n\nThey two - Rudy Osvaldo Garcia-Hernandez, 28, and Carlos Orlando Iraheta-Vega, 20, are both being charged with premeditated first-degree murder and are being held in King County Jail in lieu of $3 million bail.\n\nAccording to police, they Juan Carlos Con Guzman, a student at Mount Rainier High School in Des Moines, from his home to fight on September 10. Prosecutors say the men then drove to a remote location near the river \""with a plan to torture and kill him\"".\n\nThe murder was gruesome and prosecutors say it shows how ruthless MS-13 is.\n\nSenior Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Mary Barbosa said the suspects beat Con Guzman with a baseball bat. Then, while he was still alive, they hit the boy him repeatedly with a machete and dismembering him.\n\nAccording to Detectives with the King County Sheriff's Office, the men are members of the transnational gang MS-13, or La Mara Salvatrucha and are here illegally.\n\nThe gang was formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s by refugees from El Salvador and has been linked to vicious murders across America.\n\nIt's one of the cases that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has used to go after King County officials for their policy to not abide by ICE detainers without a judicial warrant.\n\nThey have plenty of examples, including recent violent crimes in Bellevue and Seattle.\n\nIn this particular case, ICE said Iraheta-Vega is an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador.\n\nDemocrats and the media have attacked ICE, saying they're using it as a \""public relations offensive\"".\n\nKing County Executive Dow Constantine said that what they call a PR move is actually a group of people who give a damn about enforcing the law.\n\nHere are details of the charges:\n\nOn September 10, sheriff's deputies responded to reports of a body in the Green River in Auburn and located a large amount of blood leading to Con Guzman's submerged body.\n\nThe report came back from the King County Medical Examiner's Office. It said Con Guzman was killed by a combination of blunt-force injuries to the head and cutting injuries to his neck.\n\nHe was going to turn 17-years-old in just a few weeks. In the missing persons report, his parents said he came home from work around 2 a.m. the morning he was killed. They said he took off shortly after.\n\nHere's how detectives caught the duo.\n\nThe secured surveillance footage from a number of locations showing Con Guzman get into a car near his home.\n\nThat car then made a stop at a Federal Way apartment building before heading east on Highway 18.\n\nThe victim's friends told detectives he had a friend who was an MS-13 gang member - and it was a description that Iraheta-Vega matched on Facebook, where they say he also claimed to be an MS-13 member. They picked him up and said he spilled to them.\n\nAccording to detectives, Iraheta-Vega said he told the victim to come outside to fight and settle a dispute.\n\nThat's when they apparently picked up Garcia-Hernandez, who Iraheta-Vega identified as an MS-13 member, and headed to the river.\n\nAccording to Iraheta-Vega, they had a fist fight and then Garcia-Hernandez pulled out a short machete after and began hacking Con Guzman's neck.\n\nDetectives said Iraheta-Vega was a huge help in the investigation - showing them the location of a machete, which he claimed Garcia-Hernandez buried after washing the blade.\n\nThere was another witness that apparently gave detectives a similar story, but added that Iraheta-Vega beat the victim with a baseball bat - a detail he left out initially.\n\nWhen they arrested him, he told detectives he did strike the victim with a bat, according to charges.\n\nIn their investigation, detectives said they found a machete in his room with what appeared to be blood on the blade.\n\nThe next day, they arrested Garcia-Hernandez. Not before a brief encounter with them during which they said he pulled out a gun. We're told they opened fire but didn't hit him.\n\nDid you know that Law Enforcement Today has a private new home for those who support emergency responders and veterans? It's called LET Unity, and it's where we share the untold stories of those patriotic Americans. Every penny gets reinvested into giving these heroes a voice. Check it out today.\n\nIt sure does aline with a similar slaughter in the Bronx.\n\nThey are being described as \""remorseless to the end\"".\n\nAs five Trinitarios gang members were sentenced to life in prison for the brutal machete murder of an innocent kid, they flashed gun signs with their cuffed hands to the media.\n\nThey were convicted in the slaughter of Lesandro 'Junior' Guzman in what was described as being a case of mistaken identity in the Bronx.\n\nJudge Robert Neary handed down each of the sentences separately.\n\nFirst, he condemned 25-year-old Jonaiki Martinez Estrella to life behind bars without the possibility of parole.\n\nHe's the one who gave the fatal blow to Guzman's neck.\n\nThen came sentences of 25-years to life for his co-defendants, Antonio Rodriguez Hernandez Santiago, 25, Jose Muniz, 23 and Elvin Garcia, 25.\n\nThe final gang member was 19-year-old Manuel Rivera. He's the one who dragged and knifed the innocent teen in June of 2018. Because of his age, he was given a lesser sentence of 23 years to life.\n\nIt took more than a year for the sentences to be handed down after the slaughter of the 15-year-old kid, who was hacked to death with machetes and knives on the corner of East 183rd Street and Bathgate Avenue on June 20, 2018.\n\nThroughout the hearing, Estrella and Muniz laughed and made gun gestures towards photographers in the courtroom.\n\nJunior's mother and father shared crushing victim impact statements at the hearing.\n\nTheir son was a young Police Explorer who wanted to help.\n\nJunior's father, Lisandro Guzman, opened his heart as well.\n\nHe told the courtroom that he now struggles to sleep. He dreads every weekend because they're a constant reminder his beloved son is no longer around.\n\nHe said the pain they inflicted knows no bounds.\n\nHe prays they never leave prison.\n\nOne of the gang bangers mothers, Rodriguez Hernandez Santiago, got up and started screaming after the judge handed down her son's lengthy term.\n\nShe shouted:\n\nThe mother of the criminal then out of the courtroom.\n\nThe jury handed down convictions for the five Trinitarios gang members on charges of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, second-degree conspiracy and second-degree gang assault, in June. The verdict came less than a week before the anniversary of the murder.\n\nIt was all captured on surveillance camera. Footage showed the moment Junior ran into the bodega, chased by two hooded men shortly before midnight, begging the cashier for help.\n\nYou could then see one of the men signal to a group of five other criminals, who were gathered on a nearby street corner.\n\nThen the group dragged the 15-year-old out of the store. It was captured on camera as Junior tried desperately to get out of their grasp, holding on the corner of the shop's door frame before being pulled out into the street\n\nThe group started the attack, using a number of knives and a machete, stabbing him over and over again as he lay on the floor trying to dodge the blows.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the killers later found out Junior wasn't who they thought he was.\n\nIt was a tragic case of mistaken identity, with his killers wrongly believing him to be a member of a rival gang.\n\nDuring the trial in June, Trinitarios gang member Michael Sosa ENTITY turned and cooperated with the prosecution. He told the court that murderer Estrella callously bragged that his victim was 'not going to eat for a very long time because I hit him in the neck' as the killers ran.\n\nBut it turns out Estrella did more than just hit Guzman in the neck.\n\nHe used a four-and-a-half inch knife to slice the defenseless 15-year-old's jugular vein, which caused him to bleed to death.\n\nENTITY went on to say ringleader Diego Suero ordered his disciples from the 'Bad Boys' crew to inflict 'any kind of damage' on rival gang members that fateful evening.\n\nHe said the gang gathered inside Suero's apartment, which was only a block away from the bodega on East 183rd Street.\n\nAccording to ENTITY, that meant:\n\nIt was only minutes after that when the gang members spotted aspiring NYPD detective Junior walking the streets. They thought he was a notorious member of the rival Sunset Crew.\n\nThey followed him in cars, then hunted down the terrified teen on foot.\n\nENTITY told the jury in June about how he chased Junior inside the bodega, falsely telling the shopkeeper the boy had 'done something' to his grandmother, and needed to be dealt with.\n\nBut ENTITY claims he couldn't go through with Suero's order after looking Junior in the eyes and seeing just how petrified he was.\n\nBut he didn't do anything to stop his fellow gang members, instead watching as they dragged Junior out of the shop by his ankles, and savagely hacked away at him with knives and a machete right on the street.\n\nMedia outlets reported more on what followed:\n\nAccording to reporting media outlets, ten men were arrested on Wednesday and five remained at large until Thursday when they were finally caught.\n\nManhattan District Attorney's Office's Violent Criminal Enterprises Unit and the NYPD's Bronx Gang Squad were in charge of the case, which began partially by the June 20, 2018 murder of Guzman-Feliz which five men were convicted of this June.\n\nAccording to police, the duo used the Facebook owned service to stay in contact with more than 100 Los Sures members. That's a subset of the Trinitario gang which then worked to set 'missions' for fellow gang members to carry out attacks on members of the Washington Heights-based F.E.B subset, which they believed was 'illegitimate'.\n\nAccording to the indictment, two incidents took place on October 19, 2017.\n\nIn one of them, a group of approximately 20 men, including five of the new defendants, gathered in Fort Tryon Park before chasing the first victim into a bodega on the corner of West 192nd Street and St. Nicholas Avenue.\n\nCourt documents show that the alleged gang members were holding a bat, knives, and a machete, and the victim hid behind the deli counter before they chased him outside and tried to attack him. He escaped with only minor injuries.\n\nNot long after, the group attacked a second man, repeatedly stabbing him and striking him with the bat and machete, according to the indictment.\n\nThat victim was attacked on Audubon Avenue between West 192nd and West 193rd Streets, which was only a block away from the first incident.\n\nPolice said he suffered three chop wounds to the head, a skull fracture, stab wounds, collapsed lungs, and a severed tendon in his wrist.\n\nThere's more. The gang members were also charged in relation to a November 6, 2017 incident.\n\nIn that one, another group of men, including six of the new defendants, gathered in the same park before attacking two men near Broadway and Dongan Place.\n\nPolice said they had a gun, knives, batons, and a lock, and that one of the victims was stabbed repeatedly and the other was slashed from the back of his neck to the middle of his cheek.\n\nThen there was a fifth attack related to the new indictments. This one was the stabbing at gunpoint of a man on the corner of 192nd Street and St. Nicholas Avenue.\n\nAccording to court documents, after being knifed in the stomach, the attackers hit him in the head with the lock and chased him into a Kennedy Fried Chicken Store.\n\nHe was talking about the gang, which mainly recruits people from the Dominican Republic.\n\nHe said the battle continues.\n\nAccording to court documents, Perez - aka 'Stackz' and 'Menol de Robbinnn,' as well as Lorenzo aka 'El Menor' were among those charged on 11 counts including Conspiracy in the Third and Fourth Degrees, Attempted Murder in the Second Degree, Assault in the First and Second Degrees, and Gang Assault in the First Degree.\n\nBack to the case of the murdered teen... we've learned that former gang members had testified against Lorenzo.\n\nPolice say Elvin Garcia is connected to the case, but say he was already in custody due to being convicted of Guzman-Feliz's murder.\n\nRaimy Carrasco, 19, Jery Peguero, 23, Oliver Fernandez, 25, Christopher Acosta,20, and Jorge Marques-Neto, 23, were on the run on Wednesday but were the last of the 15 to be taken in before the indictments."

al-qaida,1,"The death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is being hailed as a major victory in the war on terror. But al-Baghdadi and ISIS fit a pattern known as \the toxic triangle\"" -- destructive leaders, susceptible followers, and conducive environments -- that can explain how tyrannical leaders with personality disorders come to power and maintain it. Personality disorders are key to understanding how the toxic triangle operates, but the focus is on a system much larger than just the leader alone -- both the system of followers and their ideology, and the larger social system out of which they arise.\n\nThis article first appeared in Salon.\n\nSuch systems don't just generate one disordered leader, but an abundance of potential ones. Which is why al-Baghdadi's death can be so profoundly misunderstood, and why I wanted to ask an expert on the toxic triangle to explain it from that perspective.\n\nI turned to Ian Hughes, author of the new book \""Disordered Minds: How Dangerous Personalities Are Destroying Democracy.\"" As he explains in his introduction, he grew up in Northern Ireland as it was engulfed in the barbarity of \""the Troubles,\"" the political and sectarian conflict that saw more than 3,600 people killed over three decades. The Troubles began at the same time as the first Moon landing -- his earliest memory, \""This book has grown out of my experience of growing up in such a violent society,\"" he wrote. \""It is rooted in a childish passion to make sense of how violence can coexist with wonder.\""\n\nIt's the depth of sense-making that sets \""Disordered Minds\"" apart, drawing on a wide range of research and reflection that has gone before. Hughes' first chapter presents a well-integrated picture of what's known about three different kinds of dangerous personality disorders that predispose people to violent or excessively selfish behavior. Psychopaths can't see others as people, only as things, thus committing an inordinate amount of serious crime. Narcissists can't see others as equals, admiring themselves \""for qualities for which there is no adequate foundation.\"" Paranoids can't see others as anything but threats. Many disordered minds combine two or three such disorders.\n\nHughes then devotes two chapters to historical examples: Stalin, Hitler, Mao and Pol Pot, each of whom was surrounded by similarly disordered lieutenants atop a large organization whose core membership was similarly disordered. Each came to power, Hughes writes, because of terrible conditions that drove normal people to support extreme measures in hope of a better future. The specific ideology is irrelevant to the basic process.\n\nThese dangers dramatize how democracy can be understood as a system of protections against the threat of such disordered minds -- an outlook Hughes develops in Chapter 4, which informs the remainder of his book. This view of democracy provides a uniquely insightful perspective on humanity's struggle to secure a better future. \""The majority of people the world over crave peace, justice, and freedom from oppression and discrimination,\"" Hughes writes. \""It is only by reducing the influence of the minority with these disorders that we will begin to see this truth more clearly.\""\n\nWith that in mind, I turned to Hughes for insights on the occasion of al-Baghdadi's death that his perspective affords.\n\nThe death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is being hailed as a major victory in the war on terror. But your book draws on the framework of the toxic triangle -- destructive leaders, susceptible followers and conducive environments -- to explain how tyrannical leaders with personality disorders come to power, in a system that's much larger than just the leader alone. This made me question whether his death might be overvalued, especially since the large-scale examples you cite all involve a significant inner circle of similarly disordered individuals. How can ISIS be better understood in terms of the toxic triangle?\n\nISIS can only be understood within the larger context of the war within Islam that has been raging between Sunni and Shia Muslims for more than three decades now. The two major protagonists in that war are Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia and Shia-majority Iran. A deadly proxy battle with global consequences has been raging for decades between these two regimes for predominance in the Islamic world. This war began with the revolution in Iran in 1979 and with Saudi Arabia's response to it, in spreading its hard-line version of Sunni Islam around the globe. The sectarian violence has spread across the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and has also affected the Philippines and Indonesia. This war, not the so-called war between Islam and the West, has been the defining war of modern times, but it is seldom acknowledged in this way.\n\nAs you mention, the toxic triangle allows us to understand the rise of dangerous leaders in terms not only of the leader himself (it is always a \""he\"") but also in terms of a critical mass of like-minded followers and, crucially, the environment that allows such a leader to emerge. In the case of ISIS, this conducive environment encompasses, so far, six wars -- the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq war, the first Gulf War, the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and, currently, the war in Syria. It also encompasses the rise of the Taliban and ENTITY, as well as ISIS. The cost in terms of lives lost -- mostly innocent Muslims -- has been immense, with conservative estimates of several million dead. In the context of such brutal and protracted violence, it is to be expected that extremist organizations headed by vicious, psychopathic leaders will emerge and grow in power.\n\nWhat major misconceptions tend to confuse experts, media commentators or the general public?\n\nMedia coverage tends to focus, in general, on short-term developments and major incidents, like the death of al-Baghdadi. As a consequence, the general public is not given the broader framing that is needed to understand and effectively respond to ISIS and the wider problem of entrenched violence in the Middle East.\n\nI think we need to focus more on three underlying issues. First, that this is primarily a conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and international pressure needs to be brought to bear on those regimes to resolve the fundamental conflict between them that is fuelling the violence that gives rise to ISIS and ENTITY. The U.S. and Europe should work through the UN, together with other nations, to try to address this problem directly.\n\nSecond, this is a sectarian conflict and in such a conflict, continuing violence empowers extremists on both sides. The only hope for reducing the extremism is first to stop the violence.\n\nAnd third, a huge contributing factor in the support for groups such as ISIS, ENTITY and the Taliban is the deep political and economic injustices that mark the countries in which these groups are active. Those underlying structural issues form a crucial part of the toxic triangle and need to be addressed if the violence is to be reduced.\n\nHow do the shared outlooks of those with disordered minds help them function more cohesively?\n\nI grew up in Northern Ireland during the sectarian violence of the so-called Troubles there. There are two lessons from Northern Ireland that I think apply to any sectarian conflict, including the Middle East. First, sectarian conflicts can give those with dangerous personality disorders an easy path to power; second, religion can be used as a potent justification for the most brutal forms of violence.\n\nAs I have written in \""Disordered Minds,\"" religious extremism provides those with paranoid personality disorder with the perfect outlet for their talents as cheerleaders in whipping up hatred against a \""godless enemy.\"" It provides narcissists with the comforting illusion that they are speaking for God. And it provides psychopaths with unlimited opportunities to kill and maim countless innocents and be proclaimed heroes for doing so. As author Reza Aslan has put it, these aspects of religious extremism can transform those who should be considered murderers and thugs into soldiers sanctioned by God.\n\nWhile the leadership structure of ISIS is poorly understood, could you explain what kinds of factors might actually make ISIS more dangerous and destructive rather than less so after al-Baghdadi's death, because of the kinds of personality disorders its leadership is likely to share?\n\nJihadist groups, including ENTITY and ISIS, are predominantly Sunni Muslim. They believe that God wills an immediate, divinely-sanctioned war in order to establish his will on earth. This demands a cleansing of the world of all debasing elements, which includes not only Christians, but Shia Muslims as well. It is an annihilationist doctrine that views the murder of millions of people as God's will, and it is a doctrine rooted in hatred. As Osama bin Laden wrote, \""The Lord Almighty has commanded us to hate the infidels and reject their love.... \""This [hatred] is part of our belief and our religion.\""\n\nGiven that the leadership of jihadist organizations will be the most ardent adherents of this extreme ideology, the character of individual leaders is less important than the circumstances that might empower them. It has been clear for a long time that increased violence, chaos and disorder are the most empowering conditions for ISIS, which is why it continually tries to create them.\n\nWhat mistaken assumptions are being made (or have commonly been made) by not understanding the toxic triangle that can lead to mistakes in risk assessment and strategy in reaction to his death?\n\nThe biggest mistake being made by virtually every actor in this tragic situation is the conviction that violence will solve the problem. The media response to al-Baghdadi's death is one small example of this. The media are generally reporting this as one of the great milestones of Trump's presidency, just as the death of bin Laden was reported as one of the great milestones of the Obama presidency. These may be milestones in terms of eliminating profoundly dangerous and evil men, but they do not move the needle at all on terms of the underlying causes of conflict. In fact, depicting the killings of such leaders as \""victories\"" further fuels what theologist Walter Wink called the \""myth of redemptive violence.\"" This is the idea that violence can save us, that war can bring peace, and that violence can be readily justified. Over three decades of brutal Middle East wars provides adequate proof of the fallacy of this myth.\n\nOne of your book's main arguments is that democracy can be understood as a system of defenses against the threat of leaders with these disorders, including the preconditions that make their rise to power more likely. You write, \""This system of defenses comprises the rule of law, electoral democracy, the principle of liberal individualism, social democracy, and legal protection for human rights.\""\n\n9/11 was a horrific crime, but rather than rely on the rule of law, America responded by launching the \""war on terrorism\"" -- which bin Laden claimed had been his intent. From the perspective developed in your book, was this a mistake?\n\nI think it is widely accepted that it was a mistake. As you say, it was bin Laden's intent to invoke a violent response from the U.S. that would create even more violence, chaos and disorder -- the conditions within which support for extremism thrives. This is ISIS' intent too in its attacks in Europe -- to provoke a violent response and to create tensions within European countries and antagonism towards ordinary Muslims in Western societies. I think the \""war on terror,\"" with its ramping up of violence and its framing of extremism as an enemy of the West, has played into that script.\n\nWhat's the deeper reason why it was a mistake?\n\nI think the \""war on terror\"" is misguided because it too plays into the myth of redemptive violence, when in fact violence prevents the underlying causes from being resolved. It fulfills Hannah Arendt's prediction that while the practice of violence undoubtedly does change the world, the most probable change that it brings about is a more violent world. The \""war on terror\"" is misguided because it acts essentially as a blueprint for a never-ending spiral of violence that leaves the root causes of conflict unaddressed.\n\nWhat could or should have been done instead?\n\nInstead of a \""war on terror\"" there needs to be a concerted international effort to address injustice, oppression and political kleptocracy across the Middle East. As Jeffrey Sachs has pointed out, the United States currently spends around $700 billion per year on defense, or roughly $2 billion per day. The U.S. share of the regular UN budget equals roughly seven hours of Pentagon spending. The reallocation of some of this military spending to tackle the causes of conflict in the countries where ISIS is active should really be a no-brainer.\n\nThe last two defenses -- social democracy and legal protection for human rights -- were significant developments in response to World War II. But this system has only had limited reach. As you explain, the Arab Spring, a decade after 9/11, was a mass uprising attempting to secure these protections. How should America have responded to the Arab Spring?\n\nThe Arab Spring, and its partial re-emergence now in Lebanon, should be seen clearly as a demand from the local populations for an end to the sectarianism and kleptocracy that have mired the region for decades. It should have been seen then, and still should be seen now, as a clear signal that a new Middle East peace process is urgently needed aimed at healing the Sunni-Shia sectarian divide, and that moves towards democracy are urgently needed across the region.\n\nDespite initial success, the Arab Spring was eventually crushed outside of Tunisia. How did this failure produce even more fertile ground for ISIS and its affiliates?\n\nThe failure of the Arab Spring and the ensuing wars in Syria, Libya, Iraq and Yemen, and continued oppression in Egypt and elsewhere, have crushed the hopes of millions and helped swell the numbers of those seeking to bring about change through violent means. The major beneficiaries have been religious extremists who argue that strict religious morality is the only solution to the gross immorality exhibited by the region's governments.\n\nThe failure of the Arab Spring also illustrates that a more just and democratic Middle East is not in the interests of many powerful players in the region and beyond, and that many of those players, and not just violent extremists like ISIS, will use violence to oppose the very reforms that would lead to a peace and stability.\n\nYour book suggests that the whole \""war on terror\"" approach is profoundly misconceived, because it does nothing to support and spread the system of defenses you describe, and that our policy, allying with repressive regimes, is doing more to fuel the problem than to combat it. What should be our guiding principle in taking a new approach that properly understands the nature of the threat we face -- not just from those currently identified as U.S. enemies, but from the destructive forces of disordered minds more generally?\n\nThe peace process in Northern Ireland, and peace processes around the world, show that an end to violence gradually allows the values of the majority population -- values which include tolerance, empathy and compromise -- to replace the values of intolerance, hatred and intransigence that prevail when violence is still raging and a pathological minority hold power. The onset of peace denies psychopaths the opportunity to become heroes through the slaughter of innocents. It denies narcissists the opportunity to presume to speak the language of hatred on behalf of millions of \""their people.\"" And it denies those with paranoid personality disorder the environment in which to scapegoat innocent people as \""problems\"" deserving of annihilation. In short, peace denies those with dangerous personality disorders the brutal environment that they need to continue their hold on power. It sounds like a cliché but it also happens to be the truth -- the guiding principle in defeating ISIS should be seeking peace and creating justice across the region.\n\nDonald Trump's election in 2016 can be seen as yet another consequence of the failed \""war on terror\"" approach. He falsely presented himself as a leading critic of the Iraq war, to cite just one facet of how that played out. He's now empowering other disordered leaders both throughout the region and beyond. What should be done to counter what he's doing?\n\nTrump represents a clear threat not only to democracy in the U.S. but also to peace, stability and progress in the world. The path he is leading us is, in so many ways, diametrically opposed to the direction in which we should be moving.\n\nInstead of resolving to tackle the threat of climate change, he dismisses it as a Chinese hoax. Instead of acting to address the chronic levels of inequality that are the cause of so much division and disillusionment in the U.S., he seeks to reward the rich, punish the poor and increase inequality even further. Instead of strengthening the international alliances needed to solve the world's most urgent problems, he seeks to fragment the world into isolated nations, each pursuing their own narrow self-interests. Instead of helping to build a global consciousness that we are all part of a single humanity and that we rise or fall together, he sows discord and seeks to divide us along every line imaginable -- nationality, religion, race and gender. Instead of leading us towards a converging world where disparities in health and wealth are falling, he seeks to assert American hegemony and prevent other nations from catching up. Instead of empowering democrats and strengthening the rule of law, he is empowering dictators, flouting the law and dismantling U.S. democracy from within.\n\nIn \""Disordered Minds\"" I write that toxic leaders are never able to rise to power alone, but toxic leaders enabled by an authoritarian party and supported by a critical mass of followers who see democracy as expendable are often impossible to stop. For the sake of U.S. democracy and world peace, Trump must be stopped -- either through impeachment or in the 2020 election. His re-election would empower him to continue to reshape our world to reflect the anger, conflict and division that characterizes his own disordered mind, at enormous cost to us all."
al-qaida,1,"KABUL - A US State Department report on terrorism for 2018 says that Daesh and ENTITY and ENTITY affiliates remained active, but Afghanistan security forces -with NATO's Resolute Support Mission -- \took aggressive action\"" against terrorist groups.\n\nIt mentions that although ENTITY was seriously degraded globally after 2001, the group's remnants continue to operate from remote locations in the region, including Afghanistan and Pakistan, which historically have been exploited as safe havens.\n\nAccording to the report, ENTITY global network includes remnants of the group's leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as al-Nusrah Front in Syria.\n\nAfghanistan continued to experience aggressive and coordinated attacks by the regional Daesh branch, the Afghan Taliban, and the Taliban-affiliated Haqqani Network, the report said.\n\nIt also mentions that Daesh, elements of ENTITY, and terrorist groups targeting Pakistan, such as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), continued to use the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region as a safe haven.\n\nRegionally focused terrorist groups also remained a threat in 2018. For example, Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayyiba - which was responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attacks - and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) maintained the capability and intent to attack Indian and Afghan targets, according to the report.\n\nAccording to the report, Pakistan - which has often pledged to support the peace effort and counter-terrorism campaign with the Afghan government - did not did not take sufficient action against externally focused groups such as Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), which continued to operate, train, organize, and fundraise in that country.\n\nIt also mentions that the Pakistani government pledged support for political reconciliation between the Afghan government and the Taliban but did not restrict the Taliban or Haqqani network from operating in Pakistan and threatening US and Afghan forces in Afghanistan.\n\nThe report mentions that Iran continued its terrorist-related activity in 2018, including support for Hizballah, Palestinian terrorist groups in Gaza, and various groups in Syria, Iraq, and throughout the Middle East.\n\nIt says that Iran used the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Qods Force (IRGC-QF) to provide support to terrorist organizations, provide cover for associated covert operations, and create instability in the region. Iran has acknowledged the involvement of the IRGC-QF in the conflicts in Iraq and Syria. (TOLO News)"
al-qaida,1,"These are tough times for independent journalism. If you value Salon's original reporting and commentary, we urge you to support it -- by supporting our writers directly. Right here, right now, you can make a financial contribution to help make Paul Rosenberg's work possible. Every dollar you give goes straight to our writers.\n\nThe death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is being hailed as a major victory in the war on terror. But al-Baghdadi and ISIS fit a pattern known as \the toxic triangle\"" -- destructive leaders, susceptible followers, and conducive environments -- that can explain how tyrannical leaders with personality disorders come to power and maintain it. Personality disorders are key to understanding how the toxic triangle operates, but the focus is on a system much larger than just the leader alone -- both the system of followers and their ideology, and the larger social system out of which they arise.\n\nSuch systems don't just generate one disordered leader, but an abundance of potential ones. Which is why al-Baghdadi's death can be so profoundly misunderstood, and why I wanted to ask an expert on the toxic triangle to explain it from that perspective.\n\nI turned to Ian Hughes, author of the new book \""Disordered Minds: How Dangerous Personalities Are Destroying Democracy.\"" As he explains in his introduction, he grew up in Northern Ireland as it was engulfed in the barbarity of \""the Troubles,\"" the political and sectarian conflict that saw more than 3,600 people killed over three decades. The Troubles began at the same time as the first Moon landing -- his earliest memory, \""This book has grown out of my experience of growing up in such a violent society,\"" he wrote. \""It is rooted in a childish passion to make sense of how violence can coexist with wonder.\""\n\nIt's the depth of sense-making that sets \""Disordered Minds\"" apart, drawing on a wide range of research and reflection that has gone before. Hughes' first chapter presents a well-integrated picture of what's known about three different kinds of dangerous personality disorders that predispose people to violent or excessively selfish behavior. Psychopaths can't see others as people, only as things, thus committing an inordinate amount of serious crime. Narcissists can't see others as equals, admiring themselves \""for qualities for which there is no adequate foundation.\"" Paranoids can't see others as anything but threats. Many disordered minds combine two or three such disorders.\n\nHughes then devotes two chapters to historical examples: Stalin, Hitler, Mao and Pol Pot, each of whom was surrounded by similarly disordered lieutenants atop a large organization whose core membership was similarly disordered. Each came to power, Hughes writes, because of terrible conditions that drove normal people to support extreme measures in hope of a better future. The specific ideology is irrelevant to the basic process.\n\nThese dangers dramatize how democracy can be understood as a system of protections against the threat of such disordered minds -- an outlook Hughes develops in Chapter 4, which informs the remainder of his book. This view of democracy provides a uniquely insightful perspective on humanity's struggle to secure a better future. \""The majority of people the world over crave peace, justice, and freedom from oppression and discrimination,\"" Hughes writes. \""It is only by reducing the influence of the minority with these disorders that we will begin to see this truth more clearly.\""\n\nWith that in mind, I turned to Hughes for insights on the occasion of al-Baghdadi's death that his perspective affords.\n\nThe death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is being hailed as a major victory in the war on terror. But your book draws on the framework of the toxic triangle -- destructive leaders, susceptible followers and conducive environments -- to explain how tyrannical leaders with personality disorders come to power, in a system that's much larger than just the leader alone. This made me question whether his death might be overvalued, especially since the large-scale examples you cite all involve a significant inner circle of similarly disordered individuals. How can ISIS be better understood in terms of the toxic triangle?\n\nISIS can only be understood within the larger context of the war within Islam that has been raging between Sunni and Shia Muslims for more than three decades now. The two major protagonists in that war are Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia and Shia-majority Iran. A deadly proxy battle with global consequences has been raging for decades between these two regimes for predominance in the Islamic world. This war began with the revolution in Iran in 1979 and with Saudi Arabia's response to it, in spreading its hard-line version of Sunni Islam around the globe. The sectarian violence has spread across the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and has also affected the Philippines and Indonesia. This war, not the so-called war between Islam and the West, has been the defining war of modern times, but it is seldom acknowledged in this way.\n\nAs you mention, the toxic triangle allows us to understand the rise of dangerous leaders in terms not only of the leader himself (it is always a \""he\"") but also in terms of a critical mass of like-minded followers and, crucially, the environment that allows such a leader to emerge.

al-qaida,1,"He never touched mobile phones. Had no permanent home. Got his underwear stolen by an informant. And had his final moments narrated by Donald Trump.\n\nSuch was life for the world's most wanted man. The title doesn't exist. But if anyone could have staked the claim it was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State chief who oversaw a UK-sized empire involved in slavery, torture, lurid video-taped executions and terrorist violence in an estimated 40 countries.\n\nHis death left Isis - temporarily - without a leader, and lists of the world's most-wanted criminals without a compelling number one.\n\nThere are, regrettably, no shortage of replacements, the challenge being to rank them. Is a Burmese génocidaire worse than a Sri Lankan terrorist? A French gun-runner more heinous than a Chinese don?\n\nForbes used to compile a world reprobate ranking in coordination with law enforcement agencies, but appears to have abandoned the enterprise in 2011. The top of its list then was the Mexican drug lord Joaquín Guzmán. \El Chapo\"", as he is better known, was arrested three years later, escaped and captured again in 2016.\n\nAnother since struck off the list is the Irish-American mobster James \""Whitey\"" Bulger. He was finally caught in late 2011 after his neighbour recognised him from a most-wanted feature on TV and called the police. She pocketed a US$2m reward. Bulger was beaten to death in prison last year.\n\nThe rest of the eight-year-old Forbes lineup are otherwise still at large, including the Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony, whose militia had been so whittled down by 2017 that authorities simply stopped looking for him.\n\nThe most famous criminal survey is the FBI's 10 most-wanted fugitives list, which turned 70 this year. The bureau claims 93% of those listed are eventually caught. It recently added its oldest suspect, Eugene Palmer, 83, accused of killing his daughter-in-law.\n\nOsama bin Laden featured on the list until September 2001, when he was shifted to a newly created list of most-wanted terrorists that extends to 28 names and offers lucrative cash rewards.\n\nThe ENTITY leader Ayman al-Zawahiri is worth most at $25m. Bin Laden's purported heir Hamza (\""looks just like his father, tall, very handsome\"", Trump observed last week) never had the chance to make the list after it was confirmed in September he had died in a US airstrike.\n\nThe FBI's list of most-wanted cyber criminals has undergone a transformation. The 2010 list featured five names, including a man accused of selling illegal satellite TV connections.

al-qaida,1,"The Burkinabe honor guard stands at attention during a ceremony in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, on March 1, 2019.\n\nIslamic State leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi is dead, but the militant's followers are still regrouping and spreading their ideology across remote patches of Africa.\n\nIn the Sahel region, the arid band on the southern fringe of the Sahara Desert that stretches through some of Africa's poorest and least-governed countries, Islamic State followers are launching attacks against government forces. U.S. officials point to the Sahel as one of the biggest concerns in their counterterrorism campaign.\n\n\Terrorist threats in the Sahel are very real -- as seen in the sharp increase in the number of attacks in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso,\"" Nathan Sales, the State Department's coordinator for counterterrorism, said in response to e-mailed questions. \""The security of countries across the region is closely linked, and terrorists aspire to create territorial safe havens from which to plan attacks.\""\n\nThe threat from Islamic State persists even as President Donald Trump boasts of the defeat of the terrorist group's \""caliphate,\"" which once stretched across a swath of Syria and Iraq. Pentagon officials said Wednesday that the organization will remain a threat wherever local forces are unable to control it. \""We don't see a bloodless future,\"" General Kenneth McKenzie, the head of U.S. Central Command, told reporters.\n\nSales met with Senegalese officials on Wednesday in Dakar, where he reaffirmed the \""strong U.S. commitment\"" to supporting that nation's counterterrorism efforts, according to the State Department. His agenda included talks about terrorism in the Sahel as well as U.S. counterterrorism support for the coastal region of West Africa, the State Department said.\n\nAs the U.S. maintained pressure on Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, militants fled across the Mediterranean to Libya. A breakdown in security in the country once ruled by Moammar Gadhafi has allowed both extremists and run-of-the-mill criminals to smuggle people, weapons and ideology. They traverse a string of oases and routes in the region that were once used by the Roman empire to move goods, animals and slaves for gladiator games in Rome.\n\nLibya is the target of increasing U.S. military strikes. An American attack killed seven suspected Islamic State members on Sept. 29, the fourth that month, according to a tally of casualties from statements released by the U.S. military's Africa Command.\n\nThe death of al-Baghdadi, following a strike late Saturday by U.S. forces in northern Syria, may have little impact on Islamic State's ability to expand its reach.\n\nAl-Baghdadi was the highest-ranking terrorist leader targeted by U.S. forces since ENTITY leader Osama bin Laden was killed in 2011 in a raid in Pakistan during the Obama administration. Trump said on Monday that U.S. troops later killed the \""No. 1\"" replacement for al-Baghdadi, a spokesman for the terrorist group. Islamic State said Thursday that it has named a \""new caliph,\"" identifying him as Abu Ibrahim al Hashimi al Qurashi.\n\nMuch like bin Laden, who was viewed as a \""symbol and source of ideological inspiration\"" before U.S. special forces killed him in Pakistan, al- Baghdadi may have been exercising little influence over the militant group before his death, according to Paul Pillar, a former U.S. Central Intelligence Agency officer.\n\n\""The impact of Baghdadi's death probably lessens the farther away one goes from Iraq and Syria,\"" said Pillar, a non-resident senior fellow at Georgetown University in Washington. \""In the Sahel and elsewhere in Africa, the role of ISIS is more one of an ideology being injected into conflicts that have local roots, rather than of a central headquarters asserting control and organizational discipline.\""\n\nWestern intelligence officials say that since late 2017 Islamic State has devolved more responsibility to local offshoots, which had previously been managed centrally. That's empowered affiliates outside the Middle East, particularly in weakened states in north and central Africa.\n\nAs a result, the Sahel region is experiencing unprecedented levels of violence.\n\nMali has been engulfed in conflict since a loose alliance of ethnic Tuareg separatists and Islamist fighters with ties to Algeria and Libya seized large swaths of the north in 2012. A 15,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping mission is struggling to cope and is often treated with hostility by the population.\n\nThe violence is also spreading farther south and west.\n\nThe U.S. is \""increasingly concerned about the spread of terrorism into coastal West Africa, as evidenced in the kidnapping earlier this year of French tourists in Benin and the killing of their Beninese guide,\"" Sales said.\n\nTo counter the threat in Africa, the U.S. is working with local partners to improve policing. The U.S. State Department's Anti-Terrorism Assistance program is training, equipping and mentoring foreign law enforcement agencies to deter and disrupt terrorists. The global reach of the program has provided training to more than 150,000 law enforcement officials and first responders from 154 countries, according to the State Department.\n\n\""We also support targeted community policing programs to build trust between security forces and the populations they protect,\"" Sales said. \""This trust is vital to thwarting terrorists' efforts to exploit local tensions to weaken communities and radicalize individuals.\""\n\nUltimately, al-Baghdadi's death will have little impact on Islamic State's capacity to expand its global brand, according to James Dorsey, senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\n\n\""It is unlikely to have significant consequences for Islamic State's ability to operate\"" around the world, he said."

ABU BAKR AL BAGHDADI,1,"PRESIDENT Donald Trump could barely contain himself. On the evening of Saturday, Oct 26, he couldn't stop himself from tweeting a hint: \Something very big has just happened!\"" he announced cryptically on Twitter. Most Americans were likely not paying attention to what the president was saying, used as they would have become to the copious amounts of nothingness that their commander-in-chief puts out on a daily, even hourly, basis.\n\nThe \""something very big\"" was a United States Delta Force raid on a compound in Idlib in northern Syria. It was Sunday morning by the time President Trump could deliver his official address. It was, unsurprisingly, full of hyperbole and blather. The president stated that the self-styled 'Islamic State' leader had died a coward's death and was \""whimpering and crying\"" towards the end.\n\nRead: Islamic State leader Baghdadi died 'in panic and dread', says Trump\n\nThen, in a near 46-minute free-wheeling exchange with the media that had been gathered, he opined on many other things. This included but was not limited to the fact that he had been the first and only person to point out that Osama Bin Laden had been a terrorist and needed to be taken out -- but that no one had listened to him. And, of course, no Trump press conference could conclude without a reiteration of his superiority over all other presidents. This raid and operation, Trump pointed out, was more important than the raid that led to the killing of Osama Bin Laden.\n\nNo Trump press conference could conclude without a reiteration of his superiority over all other presidents.\n\nIn the initial few hours after the raid, it seemed that the operation in which ENTITY died had saved Donald Trump. In dire straits, with an impeachment inquiry under way and increasingly damning proof surfacing regarding his underhand dealings with Ukraine (he appears to have asked Ukraine to investigate his electoral rival Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden), Trump definitely needed something miraculous to deliver him.\n\nA raid in Syria during which the 'most wanted living terrorist' died seemed to be just the thing that would (like Osama Bin Laden's raid did for President Obama) deliver the boost required to win a second term. The aesthetics seemed designed for just that. Obama's post-raid photos showed the president huddling with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others while watching the raid. President Trump's post-raid photos showed him sitting at the head of a stately conference table surrounded by his slew of advisers and secretaries, all looking presumably at the live feed of the raid as it took place.\n\nYet even though the event had all the ingredients of a huge political win, the Baghdadi raid seems to have fallen flat, unable to provide the boost that was required.\n\nProof came just that evening. On Sunday night, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump attended a World Series baseball game. The Washington Nationals, DC's local team, was playing the Houston Astros. A crowd estimated at nearly 50,000 people was in attendance. And yet at the end of the third innings, when President Trump was introduced, the entire stadium began to boo the president. If that were not enough, the booing was followed up with loud chants of \""Lock him up\"", a variation on the chant that Trump supporters use in relation to Hillary Clinton at Trump rallies. If the stadium was at all a sample of Americans, Trump was disliked, even detested, whether or not he had caught Baghdadi or anyone else.\n\nThe reception of the Baghdadi raid by the US foreign policy establishment has also been interesting. Analysts from a variety of think tanks, the people who make up the terrorist analysis industrial complex (that has grown into a behemoth in the 18 years since the 9/11 attack), seemed terribly circumspect in their statements. Unlike the cooing and self-congratulation post-Bin Laden, many pointed out that terror networks and organisations are not eliminated if a leader is killed. At least one pointed out that it was incorrect to claim that the Americans had got Baghdadi when in fact he had killed himself using a suicide vest.\n\nFor the world beyond the US, both the circumspection and the lack of attention and admiration for the raid are positive things. While it is indeed a cause for celebration that a cruel man like Baghdadi is dead, the fact that high-profile killings of terrorists are no longer yielding enormous political dividends at home suggests that the US terror policy can finally move away from its obsession with high-value targets. Terrorism analysts in Pakistan have repeatedly pointed out the questionable nature of decapitating leadership, but the US had to come to the realisation on its own and in its own time.\n\nEven though the Baghdadi raid will not deliver Trump from his increasing unpopularity with his electorate, conducting such raids will become a fixture of every American presidency for its potential to yield political successes. Terrorism, as Pakistanis know, is not something that can be eliminated, only something that can be managed and contained. In the aftermath of the raid, the US Special Forces destroyed the compound and took Baghdadi's remains with them. They were, like those of Osama Bin Laden, buried at sea, except for the parts that have been used for DNA testing.\n\nIn the coming months, as the campaign for the next US presidency heats up, President Trump will undoubtedly claim that he has singlehandedly defeated the IS. Based on the first few days following the death of the most wanted man in the world, it appears that Americans, who will vote for a new president in almost exactly one year, are not impressed."

ABU BAKR AL BAGHDADI,1,"KUALA LUMPUR: Donald Trump's pronouncement on the killing of Islamic State (IS) leader ENTITY failed to address the most important issue, which is the failure to banish his ideology, says the Malaysian Consultative Council of Islamic Organisation (MAPIM).\n\nThe organisation also believed that the United States president, in describing ENTITY 'died like a dog and like a coward', might ensure a response from ENTITY's supporters.\n\nMAPIM President, Azmi Abdul Hamid, in a statement, stressed that the US president was wrong to see the killing as something that would help his re-election campaign.\n\nAzmi cautioned that there could be revenge attacks against the US, and that the IS terror group will splinter into many new groups that will also carry on ENTITY's ideology.\n\n\Trump's attitude will further embolden the thirst for revenge by ENTITY's loyal followers to strike at the time and place of their choosing,\"" said Azmi.\n\nHe also reminded the West, especially the US, that killing ENTITY cannot bury the actual reason for the birth of IS, which was due to Western military invasion in the Middle East.\n\nHe said such \""imperialistic and hegemonistic attitude\"" is the very reason for the establishment of groups such as al Qaeda, IS, Al Shabab, Boko Haram and Abu Sayaf.\n\nAzmi also accused Washington of practising and supporting \""state terrorism\"" given allegations that some of the groups were recruited and trained by the US.\n\nAll those groups, he said, serve a purpose to justify the US army's presence in the region, apart from fulfilling its geopolitical strategy by making sure militants continue with their activities."

ABU BAKR AL BAGHDADI,1,"Jakarta. Homegrown terror group Jamaah Ansharut Daulah made headlines once more with last week's daylight attack by one of its members on Chief Security Minister Wiranto.\n\nThe shadowy group has been the most active of its kind in Indonesia over the past few years, and it is believed to have been behind the terror attack in Jalan Thamrin in Central Jakarta in January 2016, a church bombing in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, in November 2016, a suicide bombing at a bus shelter in Kampung Melayu, East Jakarta, in May 2017, armed assaults on policemen in Bima, West Nusa Tenggara, in September 2017, and coordinated suicide bombings on three churches by six members of the same family in Surabaya, East Java, in May last year.\n\nThe United States government designated JAD a terrorist organization in January 2017, in a move to disrupt Islamic State operations in Southeast Asia.\n\nOn July 31 last year, following the horrifying attacks on the three churches in Surabaya by parents and their four young children, the South Jakarta District Court declared JAD an organization committed to acts of terror, with proven ties to the radical Islamic State group, and ordered its immediate disbandment under the 2002 Anti-Terrorism Law.\n\nBased on the court ruling, all JAD members can face criminal charges, even if they never carried out attacks.\n\nState prosecutors told the court that JAD was founded by terror convict Aman Abdurrahman in October 2014, while imprisoned on Nusakambangan Island in Central Java. It also emerged that the group's members had pledged allegiance to ENTITY, the leader of Islamic State.\n\n\""It is a fact that around October 2014, Aman Abdurrahman invited Marwan, alias Abu Musa, and Zainal Anshori, alias Abu Fahry, to visit him at Kembang Kuning Prison on Nusakambangan Island, during which the defendant told them about the Islamic State movement, led by ENTITY, and called on all Muslims to support it,\"" according to the prosecution statement.\n\nIt was Marwan who came up with the name Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, which means Partisans of the (Islamic) State, to facilitate supporters of a caliphate in Indonesia and Syria. After the organizational structure was formed in November 2014, Marwan appointed Zainal to succeed him as JAD leader, as he planned to depart for Syria to wage jihad, prosecutors said.\n\nDeath Row Convict\n\nAman was first convicted under the Anti-Terrorism Law, after an improvised explosive device detonated at his rented home in Depok, West Java, in 2004. He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment.\n\nIn 2010, he was also found guilty of having funded paramilitary training by militants in Jalin village in Aceh's Jantho district.\n\nOn Aug. 18, 2017, just a day after he walked out of prison, thanks to Independence Day sentence cuts, Detachment 88, the National Police's elite anti-terrorism squad, rearrested him on charges of inciting his followers to carry out the attack in Jalan Thamrin that resulted in the deaths of four civilians and the four attackers.\n\nNearly a year later, he received his third terror conviction, which saw him sentenced to death for a series of attacks JAD had carried out between 2016 and 2017.\n\nAman, 47, has denied any role in the attacks, saying he only encouraged his followers to take part in martyrdom in Syria. However, he refused to appeal his death sentence.\n\nIn his defense prior to the verdict, Aman said he would not object to a conviction for supporting a caliphate and opposing the government, but denied any role in terror attacks, as no witnesses had testified to that effect in the court. He was also in prison when those attacks occurred.\n\nEven before the verdict was issued on June 22 last year, Aman told his attorney that he wanted to be executed soon.\n\n\""Once the verdict is in, please arrange my execution immediately,\"" Aman's lawyer, Asludin Hatjani, quoted what his client had told him after the court hearing.\n\nAman established JAD as a home for Islamic State sympathizers in Indonesia, to prepare for the arrival of the caliphate movement in the archipelago, and to assist those who wanted to wage jihad in Syria and Iraq.\n\nBeing in prison did not limit his ability to arrange a major gathering of JAD members in Batu near Malang, East Java, in November 2015. He reportedly followed the meeting using a cell phone, and instructed his followers to prepare themselves for attacks and jihad in Indonesia.\n\nSince then, JAD has emerged as a new major threat outclassing earlier groups, such as Jemaah Ansharut Tauhid, East Indonesia Mujahideen (MIT) and even al Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah, the group behind the deadly October 2002 bombings in Bali.\n\nOver the past few years, JAD attacks have not followed a specific pattern; the group's members randomly picked targets, such as churches, police personnel and public facilities.\n\nFamily Attacks\n\nJAD has now earned a reputation for involving family members - either children or spouses - in attacks.\n\nOnly hours after the May 13, 2018, triple church bombings in Surabaya by the six-member family, a bomb accidentally exploded at a multi-story housing complex in nearby Sidoarjo, killing a woman and her daughter. Her husband was shot dead by police, who immediately raided the scene afterwards, as he was holding a detonator. Their couple's three other children, aged between 10 and 15, were rescued from the house. Police confirmed that the family were JAD members.\n\nThe following morning, five members of another family blew themselves up on two motorcycles at the gate of the Surabaya Metropolitan Police headquarters. One of the children survived after being thrown from the bike by the blast.\n\nIn March, a woman detonated a bomb, instantly killing herself and her 2-year-old child, after police arrested her husband and surrounded their house in Sibolga, North Sumatra.\n\nJAD is not only active in Indonesia. A married couple, identified as Rullie Rian Zeke and Ulfah Handayani Saleh of South Sulawesi, carried out a suicide bombing at a church in the Philippines in July. The National Police later confirmed their involvement in the terror group.\n\nIt therefore did not surprise police when they learned that Syahril Alamsyah was accompanied by his wife Fitri Andriana when he attacked Minister Wiranto in Pandeglang, Banten, on Thursday last week.\n\nNo Secrecy\n\nAnother factor that distinguishes JAD from other terror groups is that its members do not bother to conceal their identities when launching attacks, a former member of Jemaah Islamiyah told the Jakarta Globe on Saturday.\n\n\""They are different technically when launching attacks - they carry their real identity cards, with no intention to hide anything,\"" said Iqbal Hussaini, who was previously jailed for smuggling weapons from the southern Philippines to members of Jemaah Islamiyah in Indonesia.\n\nBut this difference does not necessarily make JAD better than others, according to the man who goes by several aliases and has spent years in jail on two terror convictions.\n\nIqbal, alias Ramli, alias Adrian Alamsyah, alias Rian, alias Rambo, speculated that JAD members be recruited instantly, without a comprehensive understanding of jihad, so they carry out attacks with little preparation.\n\nAnother former Jamaah Islamiah member shared his views, saying JAD members tended to attack in a hurry, without proper planning.\n\nIn the past, militant groups carefully selected their members, according to Ali Fauzi, the stepbrother of Bali bombing trio Mukhlas, Amrozi and Ali Imron. Two of his brothers have been executed by firing squad, while Ali Imron is serving a life sentence for the twin bombings in Bali that killed at least 202 people.\n\n\""The recruitment used to be conducted face to face, including the pledge of allegiance. Only people of the same family, school, or congregation could be considered as members,\"" Ali Fauzi said. \""In the digital era today, recruiters work through Facebook, Instagram or Telegram without the need to meet in person.\""\n\nAli, a doctoral candidate at Muhammadiyah University in Malang, pointed out that Jamaah Islamiah normally spent considerable time and money to in preparation for an attack, from field surveys and assembling car bomb or vest bombs, to the search for potential suicide bombers.\n\n\""It's no longer a complicated issue nowadays. Anyone interested can join easily. More often than not, their attacks had been low-key, using knives or machetes,\"" he said.\n\n\""On the other hand, these types of attacks are more dangerous, because they are also much harder to detect. This is the real challenge facing the BNPT [National Counterterrorism Agency], Detachment 88, and all of us,\"" he said. \""The knife attack in Pandeglang is not a trivial matter. It was an attack on a senior minister, a state symbol.\""\n\nHow is JAD still relevant after the Islamic State has largely been defeated in Syria and Iraq?\n\n\""To its followers, establishing an Islamic state is a matter of ideology, which never dies. It is the same story with the Indonesian Islamic State [NII]. Kartosuwiryo has long died, but the ideology remains,\"" Ali said, referring to Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwiryo, who led the Darul Islam rebellion against the Indonesian government between 1949 and 1962.\n\nLone Wolves\n\nNew details have emerged from Thursday's attack on Wiranto. According to National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Dedi Prasetyo, Syahril, alias Abu Rara, did not even have prior knowledge that the chief security minister was his target.\n\n\""They prepared the attack instantly. He told our investigators that he had seen a helicopter arriving and a big crowd of people gathering at the square,\"" Dedi said on Friday.\n\n\""He said, 'I don't know who he is, but that's our target,'\"" the police spokesman added, quoting the suspect.\n\nSyahril immediately set a plan in motion, telling his wife that he would attack the person arriving on the helicopter, and that she should attack any policemen trying to intervene, Dedi said.\n\n\""Their home is just 300 meters from the square. Three of them went there: Abu Rara, his wife and their child,\"" Dedi said.\n\n\""Lone wolves\"" are very hard to detect, \""not a single country can prevent this type of attack,\"" the spokesman said.\n\nThe couple was determined to put up a fierce fight and become martyrs at the hands of police equipped with firearms. They arrived at the scene with a knife and a pair of scissors - the only weapons they had available at home at the time, Dedi said."

Al-Manar Tv,1,"Supporters of the Hezbollah terror group drive in a convoy in support of its leader Hassan Nasrallah's speech, in the area of Fatima's Gate in Kfar Kila on the Lebanese border with Israel, October 25, 2019. (Ali Dia/AFP)\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday warned that recent massive anti-government protests in Lebanon could plunge the country into civil war, accusing Israel and other countries of working to take advantage of the demonstrations to fuel unrest.\n\nThe head of the Iran-backed terror organization spoke as the protests, which initially were triggered by new proposed taxes that followed public spending cuts, dragged on into a ninth day.\n\nNasrallah said though the protests began as a popular expression of anger against corruption and deepening economic crisis, they were now being exploited by political rivals and international and regional powers who oppose Hezbollah.\n\n\""What does it mean that the Israelis get Lebanese among those who are in the Zionist ENTITY to the border to show solidarity with the protests,\"" he was quoted saying by Hezbollah's Al-Manar television network. It was not immediately clear what he was referring to.\n\nIn an unusual move, Nasrallah spoke with a Lebanese flag behind him instead of the Hezbollah banner.\n\nNasrallah warned Lebanon could descend into civil war, conjuring fear of the country's war that lasted 15 years and ended in 1990.\n\n\""I'm not threatening anyone, I'm describing the situation,\"" he said. \""We are not afraid for the resistance [Hezbollah], we are afraid for the country.\""\n\nHe did, however, praise the protesters for pressuring the government to back away from tax hikes, but reiterated his opposition to the resignation of the cabinet.\n\n\""In view of the difficult financial, economic and living situation in the country, in view of security and political tensions that are prevailing in the region ... a vacuum will lead to chaos, to collapse,\"" he said, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nHezbollah is a major political player in Lebanon and with its allies holds the majority in the cabinet. It is the only movement not to have disarmed after Lebanon's 15-year civil war.\n\nNasrallah also called on his supporters to leave the streets after clashes broke out in Beirut between them and anti-graft protesters.\n\nUnprecedented protests have erupted in some Hezbollah strongholds, but some of its supporters have also taken offense to slogans against their leader.\n\nIn the capital's main square, protesters fell silent to listen to Nasrallah's speech broadcast on loudspeakers.\n\nAs it neared its end, the police moved in to separate Hezbollah supporters from the rest of the demonstrators, an AFP correspondent said.\n\nBefore they retreated, Hezbollah backers threw rocks, plastics bottles and branches at the other demonstrators, who responded in kind chanting \""Revolution.\""\n\nScuffles also broke out in central Beirut before the speech, when Hezbollah supporters entered the area to reject chants against Nasrallah, who was named by the protest movement as one among the political elite who must leave.\n\n\""Nasrallah is more honorable than all of them,\"" the pro-Hezbollah protesters chanted. They clashed with the protesters who were previously in the square until riot police tried to break up the fight. The incidents came shortly before Nasrallah was due to speak.\n\nAnger has been building among Hezbollah supporters because the protesters named him, along with other corrupt politicians. At least two protesters were injured. The riot police encircled the pro-Hezbollah protesters, who carried batons, separating them from the other protesters.\n\nBut tension returned when the protesters moved down the main road, lobbing stones and at one point attacking a TV crew from a station aligned with a Hezbollah rival. Some protesters chanted for calm.\n\nBanks, universities and schools remained closed Friday, the ninth day of nationwide protests, which initially were triggered by new proposed taxes that followed public spending cuts.\n\nThe demonstrators -- who have thronged towns and cities across Lebanon -- have been demanding the removal of the entire political class, accusing many across different parties of systematic corruption.\n\nNumbers have declined since Sunday, when hundreds of thousands took over Beirut and other cities in the largest demonstrations in years, but could grow again over the weekend.\n\nLebanon's largely sectarian political parties have been wrong-footed by the cross-communal nature of the protests.\n\nDrawing in Christians and Muslims, Shiite, Sunni and Druze, the street movement has largely been peaceful -- evolving into celebrations after nightfall.\n\nWaving Lebanese national flags rather than the partisan colors normally paraded at demonstrations, protesters have been demanding the resignation of all of Lebanon's political leaders.\n\n\""All of them means all,\"" has been a popular slogan.\n\nIn attempts to calm the anger, Prime Minister Saad Hariri has pushed through a package of economic reforms, while President Michel Aoun offered Thursday to meet with representatives of the demonstrators to discuss their demands.\n\nBut those measures have been given short shrift by demonstrators, many of whom want the government to resign to pave the way for new elections.\n\nThe unprecedented mass protests come amid a deepening economic crisis in Lebanon. The country is one of the world's most indebted nations, with public debt over 150 percent of the gross domestic product. The protesters accuse the politicians of amassing wealth even as the country gets poorer."

Dialogue is the best way to solution,\"" he stated.\n\n\""I am ready to meet your representatives ... to hear your demands.\""\n\nCrowds gathered in Jal El Deeb Square to watch the speech on a giant screen, reported Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA).\n\nAlong with all other major political parties, Aoun's Future Patriotic Movement (FPM) has been targeted by the protesters, many of whom have demanded the resignation of the entire government. Aoun's son-in-law Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil has been a particular target of protesters' chants.\n\nMany roads and highways across the country remain blocked, including the major highways into Beirut, according to Al Arabiya's correspondent. The army is deployed across the country, including in Nabatieh in the south, where protesters came under attack last night.\n\nIn the morning, Aoun receivied the UN Secretary-General's Representative in Beirut, Jan Kubis, who briefed him on the position of the International Support Group on the current developments, according to a tweet by the official account for the Lebanese Presidency.\n\nAfter Aoun, Walid Joumblatt, the leader of the Progressive Socialist Party and a former ally of Prime Minister Saad Hariri, is set to speak. Joumblatt has previously said the country needs a new, non-sectarian law, but that he is against the resignation of the government.\n\nThe only cabinet ministers that have resigned so far are four from the Lebanese Forces party.\n\nSpeaker of Parliament and head of the Shia Amal party Nabih Berri appeared to criticize the protests, saying Lebanon cannot withstand its current state of \""suspension,\"" Lebanese Hezbollah's ENTITY reported. There have been fears that Amal and Hezbollah supporters may try and attack protesters after a showdown with the Lebanese Army on Monday."
Al-Manar Tv,1,"News 24th October 2019 FacebookTwitterLinkedinPinterestRedditPrintemail\n\nWhat happened: Mass protests have been taking place in Lebanon for more than a week against government corruption, economic mismanagement and dissatisfaction with poor public services. It is estimated 1.3 million people - 20 per cent of the population, from across the country have participated in the demonstrations.\n\nThe immediate spark for the protests was a government plan to tax WhatsApp, FaceTime and Facebook Messager, calls that are usually free over the internet. That plan has been scrapped. Earlier this week Prime Minister Hariri suggested a range of economic reforms including a commitment to add no new taxes this year, a $160m fund for housing and efforts to reduce public debt. He also said there would be substantial cuts to parliamentarians salaries in an effort to placate the protestors and ease their financial burden. So far none of these concessions has decreased public anger.\n\nContext: At 155 per cent of GDP, Lebanon has high Government debt, economic growth of 0.3 per cent, significant poverty and unemployment of 6.6 per cent.\n\nThe last time there were protests in Lebanon was 2015 when people demonstrated again inadequate sanitation and water pollution. The latest protests, as well as being larger and more widespread, have also for the first time cut across traditional religious and sectarian loyalties with all political leaders being blamed. Other factors that have angered the protestors include the revelation last month that Prime Minister Hariri (while out of government in 2013) gave a South African bikini model $16million. The story coincided with the Lebanese government declaring another economic state of emergency. Last week the country experienced severe wildfires. The Fire Services were ill equipped to cope because of faulty equipment due to lack of government investment. Fortunately the weather changed and rain prevented further disaster. The protests have also taken place in key areas of Hezbollah support, including in Nabatiyeh, Bint Jbeil and Tyre. Even the Hezbollah run ENTITY has reported the protests and allowed interviewees to express their criticism of Hezbollah. Hezbollah's leadership faces a dilemma, they want to support that aims of the protestors and oppose the new taxes. However they do not want to lose their influence over the current government in which it has three ministers.\n\nLooking ahead: The protestors are demanding the appointment of a technocratic Government to pass a new electoral law to reform the current system which is based strictly on sectarian representation, but the existing parties in Government will resist that move as it would undermine their power structures and system of patronage.\n\nPrime Minister Hariri is likely to offer more concessions in the days ahead in the hope that he can reduce public anger and break the momentum that has caused so much public outcry. He can only tackle the immediate economic crisis with loans and support from outside Lebanon and that will depend on how much confidence he can generate in the ability of his Government to function.

LASHKAR E TAYYIBA,1,"Terrorists have families too, and those families must be 'supported'. Possibly with the help of the State, despite the international pressure and despite the repeated promises to severe all the links with terrorist groups.\n\nSo, in August, while claiming to have arrested chiefs and members of different terrorist groups and freezing their financial assets, the Pakistani government appealed to the United Nations, asking the international organisation to allow a monthly 'pension' to Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, because the founder of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jamaat-ud-Dawa needs to 'support' his family.\n\nAlso Read: Latest News: Four Associates of Hafiz Saeed Arrested in Pakistan\n\nWhy is Mohammed Hafiz Saeed Still Openly Giving Friday Sermons?\n\nThe same request -- and this did not make headlines -- had been made for Yahya Mujahid (Spokesperson JuD), Zafar Iqbal (Head of Education Wing), Haji Ashraf (Finance Wing) and Muhammad Bhutvi (Finance Wing). Pakistan had claimed to have arrested the above four men, and to have arrested Hafiz Mohammad Saeed as well, and that their bank accounts were frozen. Immediately after, the government asked one lakh Pakistani rupees allowance for each of them to 'support' their families -- and placed them not in jail but in comfortable rooms at Markaz Al Qadsia in Lahore, where they are free to go on with their activities.\n\nAnd while FATF in Paris was playing with all the fifty shades of grey to keep Pakistan out of the blacklist, the so-called 'banned' organisations and the 'convicted' terrorists were busy -- very busy -- freely carrying out their activities as usual.\n\nHafiz Mohammad Saeed has been openly giving Friday sermons at Markaz Al Qadsia and meeting JuD high ranks at his residence in Johar Town, Lahore. Where I remember ISI people guarding and protecting his house and his family, and personal guards armed with guns inside the house. Nothing has changed since then, it seems.\n\nAlso Read: Pak Failing to Curb Money Flow to Hafiz Saeed: Damning FATF Report\n\nTo Avoid FATF Scrutiny, Jamaat-ud-Dawa is 'Selling Tea'\n\nThe man placed on all the international terror lists is free as usual to meet his people and go on with his terror activities. He visited Sialkot in the past weeks to attend a JuD meeting, despite being 'arrested'. According to locals, even Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki, deputy Amir of ENTITY/JuD, made a public appearance a few days ago, for the first time after five months, and delivered a speech at Markaz Al Qadsia.\n\nThis place -- from where I've seen huge cars with darkened windows belonging to preeminent politicians going in and out -- is a so-called 'madrasa complex' in the middle of Lahore.\n\nInterestingly enough, last year, the Government of Punjab claimed it had taken over the Jamaat-ud-Dawa's famous Muridke Markaz and Lahore's headquarters of Masjid Al Qadsia in Chauburji -- but none of the organisations ever left the place or stopped giving sermons there. Nor were they stopped from collecting money to finance their activities. Locals say that, after the banning of the JuD and its charity wing Falah-e-Insaniyat (FIF) by the Pakistan government in March 2019, the JuD has been collecting funds by directly approaching wealthy donors.\n\nIn order to avoid FATF scrutiny, the JuD has also resorted to door-to door sale of tea (Black Gold Chai). While selling the tea, the buyers are encouraged to pay more for the 'cause of Kashmir'. And Kashmir has been the main focus of the activities of these 'banned' groups over the past two months.\n\nAlso Read: UN Approves Pak Request to Release Hafiz Saeed's Funds for Family\n\n'Charity' for Kashmir\n\nAt least two public meetings have been held in less than a month regarding Kashmir -- the first was to discuss the formation and functioning of local 'Kashmir Committees'. Following the instructions given by Hafiz Masood, brother of Hafiz Mohammad Saeed in a sermon calling for the unity of all Jamaat for the Kashmir cause, the local committees have been instructed to organise protests and street rallies every Friday.\n\nAnd, of course, to collect money. Fund-raising has been organised in Gujranwala, events attended by prominent businessmen of the area, who are then urged to donate in support of the JuD's efforts in Kashmir, and to show solidarity for the Kashmiri people. And if somebody thinks all these meetings are for charity and social work, they should think again and stop being delusional.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoney Collected Is Not for Families, But For Kashmir 'Solution' -- 'Jihad, Jihad, Jihad'\n\nThe money collected by all these organisations, all of them on international terror lists, are not to support people, but to execute the only 'solution' that, according to Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, they have for Kashmir: \Jihad, Jihad, Jihad\"". He has been saying it openly at public rallies and in Friday sermons, in recorded interviews and in TV shows. ENTITY has been getting people from across the border, training jihadis and managing ENTITYhal terror operations all over India. They have a global jihad agenda shared with the so-called 'Deep State' and they will not stop, despite any claims, their terror activities. With the blessings of the State, the 'official' one.\n\nIn fact, in September, Imran Khan awarded the 'Ideal Student Award' to a student of Jamia Al Dirasat Al Islamia, Karachi.\n\nHis 'ideal student' comes from an institute which is a front for JuD and is deeply involved in radicalisation and recruitment for the group. The world should stop playing with the Pantone paENTITYte of grey shades and acknowledge reality: there's only one colour for Hafiz Mohammad Saeed and his people, and that color is midnight black.\n\n(Francesca Marino is a journalist and a South Asia expert who has written 'Apocalypse Pakistan' with B Natale.

During his tenure as the vice-president of the FATF, Pakistan has often failed to demonstrate action against terror financing as per the initial 10-point action plan or the 27-point action plan shared at a later stage.

LASHKAR E TAYYIBA,1,"The reviews conducted by the FATF over the last one year have exposed Pakistan's so-called fight against terror financing.\n\nIn a pre-dawn strike on 10 February 2018, three Jaish-e-Mohammad fidayeen attackers laid siege at the Sunjuwan Military Station in Jammu, which was hardly a few miles away from the Jammu University. The attackers, who were believed to be from the FATA region of Pakistan, kept the gun-battle raging for more than 24 hours in which six Army soldiers and a civilian were killed.\n\nWhile India was caught unawares by this fidayeen strike, the North Block was fast losing patience with Pakistan's hypocrisy in fighting terror and instead unleashing a proxy war through home-grown terror groups.

LASHKAR E TAYYIBA,1,"New Delhi: Beijing's stand on Islamabad would take centre-stage at the six-day Financial Action Task Force (FATF) plenary meet, which is being held in Paris in the backdrop of this weekend's second informal summit between PM Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nAt the Mamallapuram summit held on the eve of the FATF meet beginning Sunday, Xi is understood to have recognised the importance of working together to ensure that the international community strengthens the framework against training, financing and supporting terrorist groups, and on a non-discriminatory basis.\n\nChina holds the current FATF presidency and all eyes will be on Beijing, Pakistan's all-weather ally, after Xi and Modi focused on terror financing at the informal summit, sources said. Xiangmin Liu from China is the current FATF president, having taken over from Marshall Billingslea of the US earlier this year. \""We both agreed that it was important to deal with the challenges of terrorism and radicalisation in an increasingly complex world, and where our own societies were diverse,\"" foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale told the media at the end of the two-day talks at Mamallapuram.\n\nAt the June FATF meet, Pakistan secured the three needed votes of China, Turkey and Malaysia to avoid inclusion in a blacklist. But Pakistan has fared poorly in the recently released report of FATF's Asia Pacific Group on terror funding. This report strengthens India's case for the FATF plenary in Paris, officials told ET. The Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) recently made public its report on money-laundering and terror-financing in Pakistan.\n\nThe FATF-APG report had 10 parameters for 'Effectiveness and Technical Compliance Ratings' and 40 for 'Technical Compliance Ratings'. Of the 10 effectiveness ratings, Pakistan was found 'low' in nine areas and 'moderate' in one. Of the 'technical compliance' parameters, the country was found 'compliant' in only one, 'partially compliant' in 26, 'largely compliant' in nine, and 'non-compliant' in four.\n\nThe 228-page report titled \""Mutual Evaluation Report 2019\"" will be one of the yardsticks for the scrutiny at the Paris meet. \""With the exception of some recent actions, Pakistan has not taken sufficient measures to fully implement UNSCR 1267 obligations against all listed individuals and entities - especially those associated with ENTITY/Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), and Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation (FIF) as well as the groups' leader Hafiz Saeed,\"" the FATF-APG report said."

AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE,0,"Last week saw the Batswana having their peaceful democracy, an envy for most of SADC nations.\n\nPresident Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe Masisi (born 21 July 1961) is back at the helm as the President of Botswana, serving since 2018. He has also served as Minister of Education since 2014, and previously he was Minister of Presidential Affairs and Public Administration from 2011 to 2014. These Batswana have a lot to teach SADC honestly in as far as what constitutes free and fair elections.\n\nThere are a lot of lessons we can draw from the Zebra and Diamond Nation. RIGHT TO ORGANISE - A FREE POLICAL ACTIVISM The cherished democratic order and peace in Botswana makes it an envy of many countries in SADC. No wonder their economy is still very strong and somehow that makes it one of the well run democracies and somehow their peace is the envy of this region.\n\nBatswana are free to organise themselves under their envied multi-party political parties which has since become their trademark and peaceful in SADC. It is interesting that there is no public financing for political parties.\n\nTheir electoral reforms passed in 2016, increased fees for candidates contesting elections and this drew criticism as many felt it gave the ruling Botswana Democratic Party advantage over other political parties and thus causing so much disadvantaging to the opposition. Nothing beats freedom of association and assembly that is guaranteed under a multi-party democratic order.\n\nBDP IS STILL THE BOSS It is beyond doubt that the ruling BDP has dominated the political landscape in Botswana since 1966. It was in 2014 that their vote total slipped below 50 percent for the first time in its history. Several of the largest opposition parties formed a coalition, the UDC to contest elections and it was such an interesting development in the history of this great nation. Even though the BCP had joined the UDC in February 2017, it still failed to win the national elections and take power from BDP.\n\nPOLITICAL RIGHTS FOR ALL Batswana political landscape has allowed women to have full political rights. What still remains a great challenge is the continued cultural factors that keep limiting their political participation. Only 9.5 per cent of legislators in the National Assembly are women, and this is concerning indeed.\n\nIn May 2017, after a nine-year delay that was criticised by women's rights groups, former President Ian Khama signed the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol on Gender and Development, which aims to empower women and reduce gender-based discrimination. People with disabilities participated at low levels in the 2014 parliamentary elections, and Botswana is not a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).\n\nWHAT ABOUT CORRUPTION? Botswana has good laws that attempt to address corruption. Such laws are generally enforced, the main anti-corruption agency, the Directorate on Corruption and Economic Crime (DCEC) has been ineffective in pursuing cases of high-level corruption. In July 2017, David Mosetse, an ally and friend of Isaac Kgosi, Director General of the ENTITY and Security Services (DISS), was appointed to lead the anti-corruption body. Because Kgosi had been implicated in a money-laundering scandal, critics denounced the appointment as a bid to shield him from prosecution.\n\nFREEDOM OF THE MEDIA Botswana has freedom of expression as constitutionally guaranteed. However, journalists continue to be subjected harassment and intimidation from the government. In March, three journalists from the INK Centre for Investigative Journalism were temporarily detained while trying to access one of President Khama's homes in the village of Mosu for a report on corruption. Security agents threatened to shoot the journalists if they attempted to access the property again.\n\nWhoever thought such could be experienced in this great nation? The state-run media is still dominated by BDP and television broadcasting, in particular, is still state controlled. In August, the country's ombudsman found that Botswana Television favours the ruling party. State-run outlets frequently censor stories in may conflict with the government's interests, including reports on corruption investigations or opposition rallies. Even though freedom of expression is constitutionally protected and typically respected in practice, the law restricts the ability of public sector workers to air their political views.\n\nIn April 2017, the Court of Appeal ruled that teachers could not make statements for or against a political party in the media, affirming existing law; the ruling affects all public sector workers. FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND ASSEMBLY Even though assembly is guaranteed constitutionally, this has its limitations unfortunately and some feel it is not upheld in practice.\n\nIn February 2017, students protesting their delayed allowances at the University of Botswana were violently dispersed by th police. Officers used rubber bullets and teargas, and some students were beaten. One transgender student who was arrested claimed that she was made to strip. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs), including human rights groups, generally operate without restrictions.\n\nThe right to form a union is respected, but the government places restrictions on who can strike. The Trade Dispute Act was amended in 2016 to include teachers, diamond cutters, and veterinarians among those providing \essential services\"" who are not legally allowed to strike. Because of limitations on the right to strike, the government declares many strikes to be illegal, and workers can be dismissed for their participation in these cases. The law does not always protect workers from anti-union discrimination by employers.\n\nRULE OF LAW AND INDEPENDENCE OF JUDICIARY The Judiciary is generally independent and free from executive interference. Several incidents in 2017 raised concerns that President Khama was attempting to exert undue influence on the courts, but theJudiciary showed resilience in the face of Executive pressure. In February 2017, the Court of Appeal invalidated the president's reappointment of six of its justices, ruling that they could not be reappointed after serving a fixed three-year term under the law.\n\nIn May, the same court ruled against Khama's refusal to appoint Omphemetse Motumise to the bench as recommended by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC). The president's appointment that month of a close subordinate, his permanent secretary to the JSC, which recommends judicial appointments, added to concerns about Executive influence. The right to a fair trial is protected by the constitution and generally upheld in practice. However, the Judiciary lacks human and financial resources, which has led to a backlog that results in lengthy pre-trial detentions. Attorneys are provided to all defendants in capital cases, but defendants in noncapital cases must pay for their own counsel.\n\nThe DISS has the power to arrest suspects without a warrant if agents believe they have committed or will commit a crime. Some civil society groups have raised concerns about the DISS's expansive powers and insufficient oversight and accountability. PROTECTION FROM PHYSICAL FORCE Although citizens are largely protected from the illegitimate use of force, corporal punishment is imposed in some cases, a practice that many human rights groups criticise as cruel and degrading.\n\nInstances of police brutality have been reported, and perpetrators are rarely held accountable. Although the Parliament passed a motion in 2012 calling for an Independent Police Investigations Directorate (IPID) to handle allegations of police abuse, the ministry of defence, justice, and security has not yet established the body. GUARANTEES FOR EQUAL TREATMENT Customary law, commonly applied in rural areas, often discriminates against women economically and perpetuates the view that women play a subordinate role in society.\n\nThe indigenous San people tend to be economically marginalised and lack access to education. There have been reports of beatings, abuse, and arbitrary arrests of the San by the police and park rangers. Refugees in Botswana are detained in encampments where they are denied the ability to work and integrate into local communities. Many asylum seekers are held at the Francistown Centre for Illegal Immigrants, where deteriorating conditions have reportedly included leaking tents and communicable diseases.\n\nIn November 2017, the Court of Appeal rejected a High Court ruling that the detention of 165 asylum seekers was illegal. It ruled that only recognised refugees, not asylum seekers, were permitted at the Dukwi refugee camp, and ordered asylum seekers back to Francistown. BOTSWANA A GREAT SUCCESS Even though Botswana is a landlocked country of about two million people in southern Africa, it has the highest per-capita growth rate in the world for more than three decades after its independence in 1966.\n\nUnlike many resource-rich African states, Botswana implemented prudent policies to manage its resources."
AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE,0,"CIA death squads responsible for spike in Afghan civilian casualties\n\nCivilian casualties have reached a record high in the 18-year-old US war in Afghanistan as the Trump administration has broken off talks with the Islamist insurgents of the Taliban and ordered a sharp escalation in US airstrikes and night raids by CIA-backed death squads.\n\nAccording to a report issued by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), more than 4,300 Afghan civilians were killed or wounded between July and September of this year, an all-time high for any quarter since the agency began keeping figures a decade ago.\n\nIn a 42 percent increase in casualty figures compared to the same period last year, 1,174 civilians were killed and 3,139 wounded. The report further recorded the killing of at least 2,563 civilians in the first nine months of this year, including 261 women and 631 children.\n\nWhile the report blamed the Taliban's attacks for 46 percent of the casualties, US air strikes saw the steepest increase for any cause of death and injuries, with the UN recording their killing or wounding of 650 civilians during the first nine months of 2019, more than double the casualties inflicted by US bombings a year ago.\n\nAccording to Pentagon figures, US warplanes struck Afghanistan with nearly 40 airstrikes each and every day during September of this year, reaching a total of more than 1,100 bombing raids over the course of the month. This is more than double the number of strikes carried out as recently as July.\n\nUNAMA has also pointed to so-called \kill-or-capture\"" or \""night raids\"" carried out by a network of shadowy militias that have been organized, financed and directed by the US Central Intelligence Agency as a growing and disturbing cause of civilian casualties.\n\nOperating outside of the chain of command of either the Afghan or US military, these militias include the so-called Khost Protection Force, which was formed by former Northern Alliance militias after the US 2001 invasion, working in close collaboration with the CIA. Others are known simply as NDS 01, NDS 02, NDS 03 and NDS 04, ostensibly under the command of the ENTITY of Security, but in reality answering to no one besides the CIA's operatives in Afghanistan. All of them have carried out a reign of terror in rural areas where the US and its puppet regime are contesting the Taliban for control.\n\nA report issued late Wednesday by Human Rights Watch, titled \""'They've shot many like this,' Abusive night raids by CIA-backed Afghan strike forces,\"" has charged that the US agency is running death squads in Afghanistan that have carried out extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances and murderous attacks on medical facilities. The report states that these actions constitute war crimes under international law.\n\nThe CIA's role in directing these death squads is bound up with their illegal character. The US military's special operations units, which had previously conducted such operations, scaled back on night raids in 2011 in the face of widespread protests by the Afghan population. While US law bars the Pentagon and the State Department from funding foreign militias involved in crimes against civilian populations, no such rule applies to the covert activities of the CIA. The intelligence agency has run the death squads with the participation of US special forces, principally Army Rangers, who are loaned out to the agency under a program initially dubbed as Omega.\n\nThese special operations troops, along with CIA operatives and US military contractors, frequently accompany the Afghan militias in their \""kill or capture\"" missions. Even when they don't, the US military in most cases provides critical logistical support, including flying the death squads to their targets on helicopters, carrying out the logistical planning for these operations, and launching airstrikes to support them.\n\nDescribing the actions of the CIA-run militias as \""war crimes,\"" Patricia Grossman, HRW's associate Asia director and author of its report, said, \""In case after case, these forces have simply shot people in their custody and consigned entire communities to terror of abusive night raids and indiscriminate airstrikes.\""\n\nThe report describes a number of these missions, including an August 11, 2019 attack by the NDS 01 militia, accompanied by US personnel, on a village in eastern Paktia province. In the ensuing rampage, the report states, the strike force \""blew open the doors of the house and shot four men in front of the rest of the family. In another house, they fatally shot three shopkeepers and one of their guests, all of whom were home for Eid celebrations. In the third incident, they killed a religious teacher and two construction workers.\"" Relatives reported that the victims, who were unarmed and offered no resistance, were shot either in the eyes or the mouth.\n\nIn another incident from October of last year, a raid by the NDS 02 militia in Nangarhar province resulted in 13 civilian deaths. A survivor of the raid, which went on for two nights, described one of the massacres: \""First they blew up the door. When a father of the family came out of the house, they shot him first, then the sons came out to check on him and they killed them, then another brother came, and then the women stopped another brother from coming out. The women said, 'Please don't kill us,' and then they shot an older woman. A younger girl ran to the brother and they shot her, injuring her, then killed the last brother.\""\n\nThe HRW report describes similar atrocities carried out by the CIA death squads in Kandahar, Paktia and other provinces over the past year.\n\nIn a break from previous policy, the Pentagon has allowed the Afghan militias to directly call in the airstrikes without any regard to the presence of civilians in targeted areas.\n\nThese airstrikes have resulted in indiscriminate slaughter. The HRW report includes an interview with Masih Ur-Rahman Mubarez, whose entire family was killed in September of last year after a US and Afghan strike force raided a village in central Wardak province, which had long been under de facto Taliban control. The strike force called in a US air strike which struck Mubarez's house killing his entire family, including his wife, four daughters, three sons and three nieces. The children ranged in age from four to 16. He told HRW: \""I tried to call my family that morning. I could not reach them. Then a neighbor called and told me my house had been hit ... I have lost everyone -- I am alone now.\""\n\nThe report also documents the systematic attacks carried out by the CIA-run militias on medical facilities suspected of treating wounded Taliban fighters, a patent war crime. In the most infamous case, a July 2019 raid on a Swedish-funded clinic in Wardak province, the death squad was ferried in aboard a US helicopter. After tying up all of the medical staff and family members of patients, the strike force dragged out four men, including the clinic's director. After the gunmen had left, villagers found the bodies of three of the men, along with that of a family caregiver inside the facility. The director has disappeared.\n\nThe CIA responded to the HRW report with a blanket defense of its crimes and a thinly veiled warning against those who expose them. \""War will never be 'immaculate,'\"" it said. It added, \""Our challenges are immense because we face enemies who do not wear uniforms, who hide among women and children, and who use lies about the death of civilians to try and check our effectiveness.\""\n\nThese atrocities are the direct outcome of a deliberate strategy of the Pentagon and the CIA to continue the US war into its 19th year under conditions of a diminished direct US military presence on the ground. Gen. Scott Miller, the US commander in Afghanistan, reported last week that the US troop strength in the country had been cut by 2,000 over the past year to a current force of 12,000.\n\nThe Trump administration has ordered a sharp intensification of the slaughter in Afghanistan, where the number killed outright over the last 18 years is conservatively estimated at 150,000, with hundreds of thousands more dying from the effects of the war.\n\nIn early September, Trump scuttled a reported peace agreement with the Taliban reached after a year of negotiations. While the US president claimed that he took the action in response to the death of one US soldier in a Taliban attack, the reality is that he was responding to sharp criticism from both within the US military command and his ostensible political opponents in the Democratic Party.\n\nIn Afghanistan, as in Syria, Trump's promise to end Washington's \""forever wars\"" has amounted to empty demagogy. His administration, like its Democratic and Republican predecessors, is continuing these wars, launched under phony pretexts of combating terrorism or \""weapons of mass destruction.\"" Washington's strategic aim remains the assertion of US hegemony over principal sources of the world's energy resources -- the Caspian Basin and the Persian Gulf -- in a bid to reverse by military means the decline of American capitalism's global dominance."
AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE,0,"The 2019 winners of our annual Industry Innovator Awards are a showcase of the breadth and depth of capabilities of government contractors.\n\nThe projects and solutions developed by these companies are diverse and vary from artificial intelligence to better cloud migration to logistics management to improved cybersecurity.\n\nWhile the solutions are as different as the companies themselves, there is a common theme. They are all focused on the mission. In many ways the technology itself takes a back seat. In fact, some of the 2019 Industry Innovators didn't tout their technology as much as they touted the way they work with the customers.\n\nThe predominant focus on mission marks a shift in the market over the past decade as companies come to rely less on their IT skills as a differentiator and more on their understanding of what their customer is trying to accomplish.\n\nFor example, Chemonics International leveraged its understanding of USAID's supply chain challenges to develop a system for tracking products that works on handheld devices in remote locations.\n\nSAIC has developed an Internet of Battlefield Things to tie sensors and other devices together to improve situational awareness for the warfighter. And it has applications beyond the battlefield.\n\nICF International created a process that changes how people exchange ideas and work together to create solutions.\n\nYou'll see more examples of innovation in the projects described below. They represent the best of the best. These companies deserve kudos but they also represent what the industry as a whole is doing - combining great technology with mission expertise to produce tangible results. That combination has become the hallmark of successful companies in the government market.\n\nWhen the Accenture Federal Digital Studio opened in 2016, the goal was to help government customers, partners and stakeholders find new ways to drive change. The studio's two main offerings -- service design and digital product design -- bring proven commercial practices and emerging technologies to bear on public-sector problems.\n\nIn one project, the company is developing ways to deliver training to veterans and building an online community to change how veterans receive on-demand care for combat stress.\n\nMore than 9,000 Accenture Federal employees have been trained on the Digital Studio's approach to co-creation and collaborative problem-solving.\n\nApplied Insight has invested in cutting-edge technologies through acquisitions, internal research and the creation of aiLabs. The company also created Altitude, an automated and scalable platform-as-a-service cloud management solution that lets organizations retain total control, compliance and visibility over their cloud environments. The solution helps remove barriers to large-scale cloud adoption by working across private and public cloud infrastructures and enabling data analytics and machine learning tasks.\n\nLeveraging its Salesforce expertise, B3 has worked to overcome major issues at the Department of Veterans Affairs' Digital Transformation Center, including internal resistance to change and competing demands on time and resources. The VA has struggled with deciding when to apply modernization principles to IT operations, but B3 has taken on several of those initiatives, including developing relevant standards and guidelines and pushing out support to 22,000 users. The company is also handling a case management system for a White House hotline and developing a time-tracking application for employees of the Veterans Benefits Administration.\n\nThanks to the continuous integration process B3 implemented, more than 20 development projects are being deployed each month. As a result, VA is moving away from many of its homegrown solutions as it gains more confidence in the capabilities and value of the Digital Transformation Center.\n\nCACI developed its Agile Solution Factory as a way to speed the development of high-quality software that meets agency missions. More than 200 government customers have toured the Ashburn, Va., facility to learn about best practices related to agile transformation, optimization, scaling and holistic integration. The factory helped CACI win an $880 million task order to help the Army develop software for its personnel and force management systems.\n\nCustomers are seeing improvements that include increased productivity, lower implementation costs, delivery of what CACI says is 99 percent defect-free software and a faster time to market.\n\nCGI Federal developed Unify360 to help agencies transition to hybrid cloud environments. It supports provisioning, configuration, reporting, billing and workload management for on-premises and cloud-based services.\n\nOne CGI customer, a large agency with 29 internal organizations, needed to move away from a private data center model before the existing contract expired. With Unify360 at the heart of the project, the firm handled the architecture, design, implementation and migration of over 900 critical business system workloads -- and 700 servers and associated applications -- into a hybrid cloud. Unify360 allowed the agency to become the first in the federal government to successfully migrate 95 percent of its workloads to the cloud and do so without a single unplanned outage during migration.\n\nThrough its work on the U.S. Agency for International Development's Global Health Supply Chain Procurement and Supply Management project, Chemonics developed the Transportation Information Tool (TransIT) and an app called ePOD, for Electronic Proof of Delivery.\n\nThe solutions provide better visibility by tracking products throughout the supply chain and capturing photos at delivery. They enhance security, mitigate risks and improve financial controls. TransIT and ePOD are being tested in Cameroon, Mozambique and Angola and will be rolled out to more countries in the coming months.\n\nWindRose is an automated tool for assessing supply chain threats. It captures and analyzes open-source and public data from over 50,000 sources -- including the deep and dark webs, news feeds, social media, financial institutions and data corruption lists. The technology uses five key vectors of analysis to identify threats to the supply chain: cyber exposure, hardware and device risks, regulatory and legal risks, and financial risks.\n\nWith support from CyberCore's analysts, WindRose pulls the best methods, sources, service providers and analytical tools into a single platform.\n\nGalois\n\nPreserving Privacy and Security in Critical Federal Intelligence IT\n\nThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency tapped Galois to develop a secure election system using technology that could then be applied to other situations. The election system will be opened to anyone to try to hack it as a way of identifying vulnerabilities.\n\nGalois is also enhancing the security and privacy of Census Bureau products, including those that inform Congress about the health of the economy. The industry inputs that feed the bureau's calculations are often paper-based and delayed by months, but the company's efforts are speeding the delivery of that information.\n\nThe defense contractor used AI and machine learning to develop the Multi-INT Analysis and Archive System (MAAS) to capture, distribute and exploit full-motion video and geospatial intelligence capabilities.\n\nThe company built the Fusion Analytics Core Element Traction Services (FACETS) system so customers with intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions could leverage open-source and cloud-based capabilities. FACETS brings AI and machine learning to MAAS and incorporates automated algorithm deep learning, object detection and characterization, and correlation and fusion of information from multiple sources.\n\nICF International\n\nInnovation Management and Spark Sessions to Modernize Government Programs\n\nICF International's innovation is not a specific technology but rather a management approach that creates intentional space to identify priorities for change and a framework for continuing to advance change. ICF's Spark Labs engage customers in innovation activities to build the capacity for ongoing innovation management so that the benefits can expand and live on beyond the scope of individual projects. The approach is designed to build buy-in and develop capacity at the critical middle layer of organizations that directly manage project teams and deliver day-to-day work.\n\nOfficials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health have used Spark sessions to prepare for and make the most of innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud.\n\nLMI created the Maintenance and Availability Data Warehouse to capture maintenance costs related to corrosion on weapon systems. It now contains 1.1 billion task-level transaction records and another 500 million supply and materials requisition records. The warehouse aggregates data from 46 systems across the Defense Department and enables visibility into almost all aspects of enterprise maintenance -- a first at DOD.\n\nTo pull this together, LMI created a common language for measuring availability of weapon systems, inventory and costs with the help of machine learning and natural language algorithms.\n\nIn the past two years, NCI has formed exclusive partnerships with three other companies that are developing artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. Through its partnership with Olive, the company developed Scaling Humans with AI (Shai), which helps agencies shift their workforces to high-value tasks. NCI has since formed partnerships with Tanjo and Holonic Technologies to add more AI capabilities to Shai.\n\nFor an Air Force customer, NCI used Shai to convert 80,000 lines of code while maintaining like-to-like capabilities, including over 300 business rules, 15 user interfaces and 325 input files. Estimated to take 18 months and cost over $5 million, the Shai-powered conversion instead took only three months at a cost of less than $1.5 million.\n\nNoblis' Pieces of Eight is a process for studying connected vehicle applications on a large scale rather than looking at individual autonomous machines. It uses blockchain technology to enable secure communication among a group of autonomous vehicles. The concept won the Highest Potential Impact Award and the Most Creative Award at the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative competition in Munich, Germany, in February.\n\nNoblis used a fleet of small 3-D-printed machines for its demonstration, which included land vehicles and drones. The vehicles operated independently and essentially bid for the right of way to show what autonomous orchestrated movement looks like.\n\nNTT Data partnered with Dell Technologies and the city of Las Vegas to deliver a smart-city solution that relies on internet-of-things edge analytics. It uses high-definition optical, sound and motion sensors and an array of IoT devices to monitor locations then incorporates historical sources such as crime, weather and social media data. The system identifies incidents such as wrong-way driving and people of interest, and detects loud noises such as gunshots, breaking glass or panicked screams. The result is improved situational awareness, warnings and alerts.\n\nNuWave\n\nVirtual Anticipation Network for Enterprise Management Decision Support\n\nNuWave created the Virtual Anticipation Network (VANE) as part of a project for the Army's Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office to provide a transparent platform for assessing machine learning-generated insights. The application now supports users in the U.S., Britain, Singapore and elsewhere. It runs hundreds of \""what if\"" scenario models concurrently in near-real time against 667 sensors that produce millions of data points.\n\nBy factoring in political, military, economic and social variables, VANE gives decision-makers insight into their organization or operating environment. One client, the Army G3 Force Management Directorate, brought together data from over 20 enterprise systems to power dashboards of consolidated information in the Enterprise Management Decision Support application to identify obstacles to military readiness.\n\nBlockchain solutions have been a priority at Octo, and one result is its LogChain offering. For the Department of Health and Human Services, the company proved that LogChain is a cost-effective and trustworthy tool for securing networks and expediting security audits. In addition, LogChain helps agencies meet the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation program's requirement for trusted log information. Once the company's proof of concept was completed, it made the offering available as an \""as a service\"" node that agencies can use to verify their log files.\n\nPacStar's Secure Wireless Command Post is helping the Army and Marine Corps secure networking and communications at the tactical edge. Because the solution eliminates the need for miles of cabling and air-conditioned tents, the Army has been able to dramatically reduce command post setup and tear-down times while transforming how it securely transmits information. The Marine Corps, meanwhile, can now send classified data using commercial smartphones and tablets for mission-critical operations.\n\nPeraton\n\nCyber Hardened Exascale Secure Survivable Cross Domain Solution\n\nPeraton developed the Cyber Hardened Exascale Secure Survivable (CHESS) cross-domain solution to enable secure machine-to-machine transfer of information across multiple security classification networks. It protects those networks from cyber intrusions and unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\nCHESS' zero trust model validates system integrity by continuously isolating and mitigating threats. The architecture is scalable and agile, and it uses commercial off-the-shelf technology along with free and open-source software based on Open Mission Systems and the Universal Command and Control Interface.\n\nPerspecta Labs\n\nSituational Awareness, Cyber Weapon Hunting and Dynamic Network Reconfiguration\n\nPerspecta has developed a group of technologies that combine sensors, cyber defenses and the ability to dynamically reconfigure networks to create a moving target as a defense.\n\nThree tools -- Scalable and Holistic Energy Cyber Weapon Localization and Characterization; Machine-Intelligence for Advance Notification of Threats and Energy-Grid Survivable Situational Awareness; and Distributed, Assured and Dynamic Configuration -- were put to the test by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Energy Department. The agencies jointly evaluated the tools' grid recovery capabilities during a multifaceted, simulated cyberattack on a model of the U.S. power grid built on Plum Island, N.Y.\n\nThe tested technology is now being deployed by state and federal cybersecurity first responders such as the Maryland Air National Guard.\n\nPotomacWave created FedDataCheck to help its government customers maintain data integrity by alerting contracting officers to inaccuracies in contract information. The tool uses standard Microsoft technology combined with data warehousing and business intelligence. It pulls data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation and the System for Award Management and runs close to 140 checks for each contract.\n\nWhen an inaccuracy is found, FedDataCheck flags it and notifies contracting officers so they can correct the information. Ten agencies are already using the tool.\n\nPrecise Software Solutions built the Food Outbreak Signal Detection System using the latest natural language model. It identifies potential food safety problems based on social media streams such as Twitter, predicts whether the text contains food safety information and extracts food types, symptoms and locations. A website with a geographic information system interface shows the number of signals in each area and the relevant details.\n\nRaytheon\n\nDevOps in the Air Operations Center-Weapon System\n\nRaytheon Intelligence, Information and Services partnered with other companies -- including Pivotal Labs, Solidus and Elevate -- to speed the development and deployment of new software capabilities to warfighters through the ENTITY's Air Operations Center-Weapon System, the Army's Air Soldier System and other programs.\n\nCombining new technologies with its engineering expertise, Raytheon created a system that can deliver new applications the same way smartphones receive updates. Using commercial software models allows the company to give customers the products they want. A constant feedback loop helps Raytheon developers understand how their choices affect users so that they can deliver better software.\n\nRSDC adapted IPsoft's Amelia digital assistant as a help-desk tool. After successful tests at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Army's Network Enterprise Technology Command, RSDC partnered with the Defense Logistics Agency for broader implementation.\n\nAt DLA, the focus started with the most common help-desk inquiries. In the first year, Amelia was trained on the agency's functions and the language used by employees and customers. The solution can understand spoken or typed words and infer the user's intent.\n\nWith Amelia on track to take the majority of tier zero calls in the coming year, employees are increasingly free to respond to more complex inquiries.\n\nWith its Internet of Battlefield Things, SAIC took on the task of ensuring that warfighters have real-time, multidomain situational awareness and persistent communications that operate even in disconnected mode. The solution uses internet-of-things and related commercial technologies.\n\nThe Army and the Marine Corps are interested in the concept, which incorporates sensors, mobile broadband and networking, cloud computing, high-performance computing and other technologies. It will allow Defense Department organizations to collect, aggregate and process massive amounts of sensor data.\n\nDuring a demonstration, the Marine Corps presented numerous challenges that represented the complexity of battlefield conditions. Using SAIC's solution, Marines were able to respond to those challenges armed with real-time information -- captured via sensors and translated through a software gateway and layers of analytics that gave meaning to the data. The result was actionable intelligence that could inform targeting and other battlefield actions.\n\nThe implications extend beyond military operations to other organizations that have highly specialized requirements, such as border security, disaster relief and counter-narcotics activities."
AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE,1,"BERLIN -- Germany charged two alleged former Syrian secret service officers with participating in crimes against humanity, in what rights activists said Tuesday would be the first trial worldwide over state-sponsored torture in Syria.\n\nAnwar Raslan and Eyad Al-Gharib were arrested in February together with a third suspect in France in a coordinated operation by German and French police, the federal prosecutor's office in the German city of Karlsruhe said.\n\nRaslan, who allegedly led an investigative unit with its own prison in the Damascus area targeting members of the Syrian opposition, is \suspected of complicity in crimes against humanity\"" in charges filed on Oct. 22, the prosecutors said in a statement.\n\n\""In this context he is also accused of murder in 58 cases, rape and aggravated sexual assault\"" in the jail where more than 4,000 prisoners suffered \""brutal and massive torture\"" from April 2011 to September 2012.\n\nGharib, a former officer who had manned checkpoints and hunted protesters, allegedly aided and abetted the abduction and torture of at least 30 people in the autumn of 2011.\n\nIn the town of Douma at the time, security authorities used force to break up an anti-government rally. Gharib is believed to have helped capture fleeing demonstrators and detain them in the prison headed by Raslan.\n\nThe Syria conflict began in March 2011 with a series of mass protests demanding civil liberties, prompting a harsh crackdown by the regime which quickly began using \""brutal force\"" against anti-government protesters, prosecutors said.\n\nMore than 360,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict with millions more displaced.\n\nAccording to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least 60,000 people have died from torture or harsh conditions in regime custody since the conflict began.\n\n\""The Syrian secret services played a significant role in this, with the aim of stopping the protest movement as soon as possible and cowing the population,\"" they said.\n\nRaslan left Syria in late 2012 and arrived in Germany in July 2014, while Gharib left in February 2013 and entered the country in April 2018.\n\nThe same day that the two suspects were arrested in February, another Syrian was detained in the Paris region for \""acts of torture, crimes against humanity and complicity in these crimes\"", the Paris prosecutor's office said at the time.\n\nSeveral other legal cases are now pending against the regime of President Bashar Assad in Germany, which took in more than 1.2 million asylum seekers since 2015 including hundreds of thousands of Syrians.\n\nLast year, German prosecutors issued an international arrest warrant for Jamil Hassan, a top Syrian official who headed the notorious ENTITY and is accused of overseeing the torture and murder of hundreds of detainees.\n\nAlthough the alleged abuses did not happen in Germany, the case has been filed under the legal principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows any country to pursue perpetrators regardless of where the crime was committed.\n\nThe Berlin-based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights has also joined with torture survivors to file criminal complaints against 10 high-ranking Syrian officials, accusing them of crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\nWelcoming Tuesday's charges, the ECCHR said: \""The first trial worldwide about state torture in Syria is expected to start in Germany in early 2020 -- an important step in the fight against impunity.\""\n\nProsecutors outlined a system of brutal interrogations of opposition members including a variety of torture methods including \""blows with fists, truncheons, pipes, cables, whips and hoses as well as electric shocks\"".\n\nPrisoners were also suspended from the ceiling by their wrists and beaten, sexually assaulted, deprived of sleep and threatened with harming their loved ones.\n\n\""The systematically brutal physical and psychological mistreatment served to force confessions and extract information about the opposition movement,\"" prosecutors said.\n\nThe ECCHR, which supports Syrian torture survivors as co-plaintiffs in legal proceedings, said 14 witnesses had participated in the German investigation.\n\n\""This process in Germany gives hope, even if everything takes a long time and nothing happens tomorrow, or even the day after tomorrow,\"" it quoted an unnamed Syrian, who was tortured in the al-Khatib detention facility where the suspects worked, as saying.\n\n\""The fact that it continues at all gives us as survivors hope for justice. I am ready to testify.\"" -- AFP"
AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE,0,"Lead Source of Premature Death, Expert Says, Outlines Preventive Measures\n\nTargeted killings, such as that of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, are emblematic of a global pattern of killings of reporters and activists, and the most important action to take in these cases of terminal silencing is to speak up, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions Agnes Callamard told the Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) today, as delegates engaged with mandate holders on the promotion and protection of human rights.\n\nMs. Callamard observed that since her 2019 investigation, which found Mr. Khashoggi to be the victim of a planned, organized, well resourced, and premeditated extrajudicial killing for which the State of Saudi Arabia must bear responsibility, there has been no credible accountability, and neither Saudi Arabia nor the United Nations have taken steps to criminally investigate the chain of command behind the operation.\n\nBringing hitmen to account is not enough; the focus needs to be the mastermind, she said, in response to questions. She proposed several initiatives to tackle targeted killings, including a recommendation that the United Nations equip itself with a standing international instrument to investigate them, based on the model of the independent accountability mechanisms for Syria and Myanmar.\n\nIn her report, she raised concern about cases in which foreign nationals find themselves facing death sentences abroad, highlighting the critical importance of consular access. Without it, individuals face disadvantages, such as the lack of knowledge of local language and their legal rights, which could prove deadly. She observed that in some cases, where individuals stand accused of terrorism, even abolitionist home States turn out to be tolerant of the death penalty by proxy, deeming such individuals unworthy of equal human rights protection.\n\nFor his part, Victor Madrigal-Borloz, Independent Expert on the protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, expressed concern about continuing prejudice against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons, which is intensifying due to the rise of ultraconservative and ultranationalist groups, who frame them as others undermining national cohesion. As a result, LGBT persons face discrimination when trying to access housing, education and employment, he pointed out, adding that their pathologization also renders health services unavailable.\n\nBaskut Tuncak, Special Rapporteur on human rights and hazardous substances and wastes, painted a dismal landscape in which toxic substances proliferate unseen, leading to rising rates of deadly diseases such as cancer. Incessant exposure to hazardous substances also poses a grave threat to fertility, he said, pointing to a 50 per cent decline in sperm counts since the 1970s. Citing the case of a Human Rights Committee decision involving 20 people in farms in Paraguay, who suffered exposure to indiscriminately sprayed toxic pesticides, he noted that wealthy countries ban pesticides which they continue to manufacture and export to countries with weaker regulatory systems, impacting their right to life.\n\nAlso briefing the Committee today were Fabian Salvioli, Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non recurrence; David R. Boyd, Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment; and Hilal Elver, Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food.\n\nAlso today, the Committee continued its general debate on human rights, with Tajikistan's delegate outlining joint efforts with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to examine the independence of judges, and Libya's representative pointing to its candidacy for the Human Rights Council term covering 2020 2022. The representatives of Ukraine, Ethiopia and Brazil also spoke, as did an observer for the State of Palestine.\n\nThe Third Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Friday, 25 October, to continue its discussion on the protection and promotion of human rights.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) continued its debate on the promotion and protection of human rights today (for background, see Press Release GA/SHC/4266).\n\nInteractive Dialogues  Truth, Justice, Reparations\n\nFABIAN SALVIOLI, Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non recurrence, presenting his report (document A/74/147) on apologies for gross human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law, said apologies are a duty on the part of States and others who commit violations. He also noted that a public apology is a way to achieve satisfaction, but it should be remembered that it complements, rather than replaces, other measures. Apologies should not serve as an excuse for failure to comply with the responsibilities of truth and justice. Rather, an apology recognizes the harm caused fully, as well as responsibility, repentance and adopting a commitment to non repetition, he said, noting that the third chapter of his report identifies the legal framework in this area. It is not possible to refuse to recognize the truth of facts, as this is a precondition for an effective apology.\n\nThe timing of apologies is important, he said, noting that symbolic dates, such as anniversaries, are ideal times to offer them. Apologies must be made by those who have the authority to do so; apologies on behalf of other persons could imply a lack of respect and make these apologies invalid. Importantly, victims must be consulted on the form, language, content, place and other elements of apologies. The report underscores a victim centred focus, taking into account a gender perspective. Also, the obligations of the State and other institutions do not end when apologies are presented. Rather, further actions  such as building memorials, carrying out judicial processes and sentencing, and providing economic compensation  lead to reparation and must be fully undertaken. Failure to take these steps would have negative repercussions, he said.\n\nInteractive Dialogue\n\nTaking the floor for comments and questions, several delegations offered examples of the apology process for gross human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law in their own countries. The representative of Colombia said her Government carries out public apologies pursuant to the orders of the Inter American Court of Human Rights. For victims, it is important to recognize the responsibility for violent acts and demonstrate empathy. This is central in the reparations process, she said. The representative of Spain said that in June 2018, his country announced the establishment of a ENTITY for Historical Memory. Victims organizations now have a centralized department to channel actions towards policies of justice, truth and non repetition. He noted Spain's plan for exhumations with the cooperation of various authorities, stating that more than 2,000 common graves have been identified in which there may be the remains 100,000 individuals. This is a complex job that requires anthropological and genetic work, he said.\n\nSeveral delegates raised gender issues in the apology process, with the representative of Argentina asking the Special Rapporteur what he believes are the best measures to bring down barriers to women's participation in all stages of the apology process. In a similar vein, the representative of Ireland, associating with the European Union, said there should be a gender perspective, otherwise there is a danger that such issues may be obscured. He asked the Special Rapporteur to elaborate on the pitfalls to be avoided when there is a sincere desire to give a public apology.\n\nOther delegates had questions regarding specific moments in the apology process, with the observer for the European Union asking the Special Rapporteur what additional steps could be taken to ensure that further State actions follow an apology. The representative of Switzerland, speaking on behalf of States from the Geneva based Group of Friends of the Mandate, acknowledged the importance of ensuring the appropriate resonance of public apologies in both the constituencies of those making and receiving them, and asked about ways to consult those constituencies most effectively. The representative of the United States said that much more must be done to support victims and hold perpetrators accountable, which can include Governments and security forces. He asked how to balance victims' urgent needs for reparation with the desire to ensure that programmes are comprehensive and address victims in a meaningful way.\n\nMr. SALVIOLI, responding, commended Colombia for its very good practices with regard to the time, place and method of expressing apologies for gross human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law. He noted that during the Inter American Court of Human Rights proceedings, there were a number of hearings where Colombia's delegation formally made apologies and asked for forgiveness from someone in attendance.\n\nHe also highlighted the importance of the participation of victims, particularly those who have experienced gender based violence or gross human rights violations as members of indigenous communities. It is important to understand cultural specificities when working with such communities. To Ireland's question, he said there are often difficulties regarding sincere apologies. A State official cannot apologize on Monday if another official will deny the facts on Tuesday.\n\nTo the representative of Spain, he expressed hope that the measures undertaken will be hastened, particularly due to the age of the families of the victims of the Franco era. They are now elderly and hoping to see the successful exhumation of their loved ones from common graves. The dictator Francisco Franco was exhumed today following recommendations by himself and the former Special Rapporteur.\n\nAlso speaking were representatives of France, Belgium, Morocco, El Salvador and China.\n\nGender Identity\n\nVICTOR MADRIGAL BORLOZ, Independent Expert on the protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, said around the world, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people remain excluded and marginalised. Describing prejudice and misconceptions about the nature and moral character of LGBT persons, he expressed concern over the rise of ultraconservative and ultranationalist groups reclaiming so called identities at the expense of sexual and gender minorities, challenging advances and preventing the development of laws and policies that include LGBT people. Political and religious leaders often point to LGBT issues as threats to national cohesion, culture and tradition, in particular during periods of political and socioeconomic instability. LGBT persons become the other, the foreign whose sole purpose is to undermine the national project from within. All these impact on the social inclusion of LGBT individuals and negatively affect their access to health care, education, housing, employment and political participation.\n\nDue to abuse LGBT pupils face at school, including physical violence, social isolation, humiliation and death threats, they are more likely to commit suicide than others, he said, noting that the response of schools is often poor, by intent or by negligence. In the workplace, LGBT persons face discrimination and abuse in all stages of the employment cycle, from hiring to termination, and in the implementation of benefits throughout. As a result, they are forced to conceal their sexual orientation and gender identity, which can lead to anxiety and loss of productivity. They also face higher rates of breast and cervical cancer, HIV infection and mental health concerns, such as anxiety, depression, self harm and suicide. The criminalization of consensual same sex sexual activities  still a reality in 69 countries  and the pathologization of LGBT people too often render health services unavailable.\n\nAnd yet, immense progress has been made in recent decades to deconstruct institutionalized discriminatory systems, myths and stereotypes, and to foster inclusion of LGBT individuals, he said. In the past 20 years, 29 countries from all regions have taken steps to decriminalize same sex relationships between consenting adults and more than 50 countries have adopted comprehensive anti discrimination legislation. Social inclusion requires dismantling all legislation that criminalizes sexual orientation and gender identity or expression, he stressed, urging States to adopt a robust legal framework protecting LGBT individuals from discrimination in all sectors and to prevent discrimination in health, education, employment, housing and access to justice. While States have the primary responsibility to adopt measures to combat violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, civil society and businesses, as well as traditional, community and religious leaders play an invaluable role in supporting inclusion.\n\nIn the ensuing debate, the representative of Bolivia, associating herself with the LGBTI Core Group, asked how religious leaders can be involved in promoting social inclusion. On similar lines, the representative of Slovenia asked how to ensure the inclusion of overlooked LGBTI persons, even where anti discrimination laws are in place.\n\nThe observer for the European Union asked how States can reduce discrimination against LGBT people in housing.\n\nThe representative of the Netherlands, associating herself with the European Union, asked how the independent expert works with other Special Rapporteurs to promote awareness raising on the issue.\n\nThe representative of Spain asked about good national strategies to address the needs of older LGBT people, who are discriminated against by society at large, as well as their own community.\n\nSeveral representatives, including those of New Zealand, Ireland, and Mexico, asked how to combat violence and discrimination against LGBT persons, and how civil society partnerships can be deployed in this regard.\n\nThe representative of Germany, associating with the LGBTI Core Group, asked how LGBTI persons can be protected against hate speech, which is on the rise.\n\nThe representative of Iceland, associating himself with the Nordic and Baltic countries, asked what States can do to facilitate decriminalization of same sex relations globally.\n\nThe representative of the United States welcomed a further discussion on use of the term discrimination, and asked about how States can improve their collection of data on hate crimes against LGBTI people.\n\nThe representative of Canada, associating himself with the LGBTI Core Group, asked about examples of existing public policies that have improved access of LGBT people to health care, housing, and education.\n\nThe representative of Czech Republic, associating herself with the European Union, asked what can be done to improve the global use of the Yogyakarta Principles on the application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nThe representative of Israel asked what authorities can do to assist LGBT youth and ensure that revealing their identity does not result in social exclusion.\n\nThe representative of Angola enquired about the reliability of data regarding LGBT people in the report, for example on transsexual women in Angola.\n\nThe representative of Belgium asked about best practices to start conversations without polarizing, in the case of people who do not recognize themselves as part of this group.\n\nMr. MADRIGAL BORLOZ, responding to comments made by the representatives of the United States and Angola, said that the issue of data is crucial to his work. There are environments in which data is not being gathered or disaggregated. The best data is that which takes into account the different sensitivities of various lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations. To questions of intersectionality posed by the representatives of Bolivia, Spain and the European Union, he said the report contains specific sections on the issues facing lesbian, bisexual and transgender women; youth; older persons; and migrants, asylum seekers, refugees and victims of disaster. He worked with the Special Rapporteur on the right to housing in order to understand the intersectionality of housing and LGBT issues. In that regard, there are certain best practices that guide non discrimination legislation in this area and actors who violate the right to adequate housing should be held accountable.\n\nTo the representative of Spain's comments in relation to ageing persons in the LGBT population, he said that data paints a harrowing picture for older persons. Giving one example, he said that every predictor of cognitive impairment with regard to Alzheimer's disease is heightened in data on gay men. Those factors include stressors in childhood years, less contact with biological families and having chosen families of the same age and with the same predictors. He gave one example of good practice with regard to ageing persons, citing the diversity framework of Australia, where public policy ensures delivery of services to the elderly LGBT population. This is accompanied by an action plan with benchmarks for progress. To the representative of Iceland, he said that deconstructing punitive systems is a basic requirement, but social integration also depends on adopting conducive frameworks, particularly for populations that are traditionally underserved. In that regard, he expressed deep concern about the lived realities of transgender persons, noting that investment is needed. Citing best practice in that area, he said public policy in Argentina includes transgender persons throughout the gamut of its public services.\n\nThe representatives of Australia, Argentina, Luxembourg, Sweden, Georgia, China, the United Kingdom also spoke.\n\nExtrajudicial, Summary, Arbitrary Executions\n\nAGNES CALLAMARD, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, outlined the findings  presented to the Human Rights Council in June  of her 2019 investigation of the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which showed him to be the victim of a planned, organized, well resourced, and premeditated extrajudicial killing for which the State of Saudi Arabia must bear responsibility. While the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia finally acknowledged this last month, albeit indirectly, she expressed regret that to date, the obligation of non repetition has not been recognized and implemented, and neither has credible accountability been initiated. She also voiced regret that neither Saudi Arabia nor the United Nations have taken steps to criminally investigate the chain of command behind the operation leading to Mr. Khashoggi's execution. This execution, she observed, is emblematic of a global pattern of killings which target journalists, human rights defenders and political activists around the world; killings which are denounced by Member States, including through Security Council resolutions. The State has a duty to warn individuals of credible threats against their life, she stressed, outlining various initiatives for tackling the issue, among them, a protocol for the investigation and response to such threats; a Special Procedures Task Force for rapid joint interventions, and a recommendation that the United Nations equip itself with a standing international instrument to investigate targeted killings, based on the model of the independent accountability mechanisms for Syria and Myanmar.\n\nTurning to her report (document A/74/318), on the application of the death penalty to foreign nationals, she outlined challenges faced by individuals in such cases, including unfamiliarity with the local language, legal system, and their rights on arrest. Consular access would mitigate such disadvantages; the lack of such support, where death sentences are concerned, is deadly, and impinges on individuals' universal right to life. This leads to distinct and complementary obligations on both the prosecuting State and the home State concerned. Prosecuting States must fulfil their obligations by international law to give foreign nationals access to their consulates  which is not always best settled in practice  while home States must provide effective consular access, she said, adding that her report cites existing best practices in this emerging norm of customary international law. She expressed concern about cases of foreign nationals accused of terrorism, in which their abolitionist home States are tolerant of the death penalty by proxy, deeming such individuals unworthy of equal human rights protection. All States must assist their foreign nationals, she stressed, adding that cases where individuals stand accused of heinous crimes require greater diligence, not the opposite. Her report sets out 10 pages of guidelines for providing effective consular assistance in such cases, she added.\n\nIn the ensuing discussion, a number of countries, including the observer for the European Union, asked about steps States can take in cases of foreign nationals facing the death sentence abroad. He also asked the Special Rapporteur to outline her planned country visits.\n\nOn similar lines, several delegates, including the representatives of Australia and Argentina, drew attention to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, emphasizing the pertinence of Articles 36 and 56 to cases of foreign nationals sentenced to death, and asked how States can be made to comply with their obligations.\n\nThe representative of the United States raised concern about impunity in reports of unlawful extrajudicial killings in Burundi, the Philippines, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Bangladesh, as well as war crimes perpetrated by the Assad regime in Syria, and asked how civil society actors can be protected from such killings.\n\nA number of delegates pushed back against what they viewed as the Special Rapporteur's abolitionist bias. The representative of the Russian Federation said that the historical and cultural context of all States must be taken into account, without which dialogues on this sensitive topic are unproductive, and proposed solutions, irrelevant. He expressed concern about the standpoint of the discussion, which is geared towards abolition and prohibition of the death penalty, a decision to be determined by States, adding that such a standpoint can lead to fraught confrontation between States. He condemned the use by some States of low quality lethal injections.\n\nIn a similar vein, the representative of China stressed that the international community must consider States' social and cultural context, adding that the death penalty is under its domestic purview and only applied in cases where individuals are found to have committed extremely serious crimes.\n\nThe representative of the United Arab Emirates expressed concern about section B paragraph 12 of the report, which refers to the death penalty in her country, stressing that laws apply to all persons in its jurisdiction. A fair trial is guaranteed, and non citizens are not disproportionately affected by the death penalty, she said.\n\nThe representative of Iceland said the report on the killing of Mr. Khashoggi makes for chilling reading, and asked how can this horrible event can ensure the freedom of expression is better safeguarded.\n\nThe representative of Saudi Arabia said that certain countries making statements appeared to have read another report. His country has taken steps to deal with this painful and regrettable crime. Eleven people have been arrested, and the prosecution has asked for the harshest punishment meted out, he said, adding that representatives of many countries, including France and Turkey attended the trials. Noting that the Special Rapporteur has used media information which represents negative positions against my country, he added that her words have accused our Kingdom without any proof whatsoever.\n\nMs. CALLAMARD, responding to the defence of the death penalty by some States, said that international law should be regarded as at minimum progressively abolitionist, adding that retentionist States should not interpret Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to hold that the execution of the death sentence is legal. It is in almost all cases, a violation of Article 7, against torture. On that front, she added, she agreed with the Russian Federation's comment against the use of the lethal injection, calling for its immediate repeal. She cited two recent cases in which a State subjected terminally ill people to this torturous method of execution.\n\nOn questions about the Vienna Convention, she said it places a clear demand on the prosecuting State, but it does not impose a duty on the home State. She cited cases in which foreign nationals notified of their right to receive consular assistance did not, in fact, receive it from their home State. These cases suggest discrimination, either on the basis of identity markers or the nature of the crime.\n\nRegarding objections to her analysis, she emphasized that it is fact based; foreign nationals are disproportionately affected by the death penalty, she assured. As for steps States must take, she said her report provides 10 pages in this regard. A starting point could be for States to enshrine in their Constitutions or legal frameworks the right to consular assistance when detained abroad.\n\nOn Mr. Khashoggi's killing, she said steps must be taken towards accountability, pointing out that while the representative of Saudi Arabia has indicated a few measures, they do not meet the requirements of international law, including on the issue of transparency. The chain of command must be investigated, she stressed, adding that she places an emphasis on this aspect because Member States and the United Nations repeatedly denounce the killings of journalists  but in all those cases, the mastermind is never identified or prosecuted; just maybe the hitman. She has suggested to the Secretary General that if the United Nations builds on her investigation, doing so could send a strong message to those seeking to terminally silence those with whom they have disagreements, adding that impunity must not be allowed to prevail in front of the media or Member States. Not all targeted killings amount to international crimes which mandate universal jurisdiction. However, Mr. Khashoggi's was found to be in contravention of multiple international laws, including the right to not be tortured and the Charter of the United Nations, which prohibits the use of force in times of peace.\n\nTurning to upcoming visits, she said she is planning to visit Mozambique, and is attempting to negotiate a visit to the United States, adding that Kenya is also on her priority list.\n\nAlso speaking in the dialogue were representatives of Mexico, Liechtenstein, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nEnvironment\n\nDAVID R. BOYD, Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment, said the world is experiencing a global climate emergency. Climate change is causing increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. He witnessed the devastating impact of climate change on his first official country visit, to Fiji, in December 2018, where the Vunidogoloa community was one of the first in the world to be entirely relocated because climate change made their previous location uninhabitable. Thousands of Fijians lost their homes to Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016, the strongest storm ever to reach land in the southern hemisphere. Many now live in informal settlements without access to adequate sanitation, making them vulnerable to waterborne diseases such as cholera. In September, he visited Norway, going out on the land with indigenous Sami reindeer herders, who told him that climate change is making herding much more difficult, undermining an activity at the heart of their culture and economy. His next visit will be to Dominica, where Hurricane Maria damaged more than 90 per cent of homes in 2017.\n\nSuch events demonstrate that climate change is adversely affecting human rights across the world, he said. States have obligations to respect and protect human rights. Unless rapid far reaching actions are taken to reduce emissions, global temperatures will continue to rise and the impact of climate change on human rights will only worsen. Clearly, a dramatic change of direction is needed. To comply with their human rights obligations and meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, States should submit ambitious nationally determined contributions by 2020 that will put the world on track to reducing emissions by at least 45 per cent by 2030. He listed four categories of action that must be taken: Addressing society's addiction to fossil fuels; accelerating other mitigation actions; protecting vulnerable people from climate effects; and providing unprecedented financial support to least developed countries and small island developing States. Concluding with some good news, he said that thanks to the rapidly decreasing cost of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries, renewable energy is now competitive with fossil fuels in many nations. It is clearly the best choice economically, environmentally and socially, he said.\n\nWhen the floor opened for questions and comments, several delegates asked about the role of the public and that of human rights defenders in the fight against climate change. The representative of Slovenia, speaking for the Geneva Core group on the resolution on human rights, asked the Special Rapporteur for his views on strengthening the element of public participation in all climate related activities, as well as on where the international community is most lagging. The representative of the Czech Republic, associating himself with the European Union, expressed concern over increasing attacks on human rights defenders and asked what could be done to reverse this trend. In a similar vein, an observer for the European Union said a rights based approach means that those who protect the environment must be better defended, he said, expressing his alarm over the increasing attacks on such defenders. The representative of Liechtenstein asked about the consequences of climate change on the right to self determination.\n\nRepresentatives from countries facing present danger from climate change shared their experiences, with the representative of Fiji noting that his country was the first to host the Special Rapporteur. It was an opportunity to discuss the challenges Fijians are facing and for the Special Rapporteur to visit the first Fijian community relocated due to climate change. Fiji presented new relocation guidelines at the twenty fourth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, giving special consideration to vulnerable groups. The representative of Brazil said OperacAPound o Verde Brasil has mobilized people, vehicles and airplanes and military persons available to fight fires in the Amazon region. An observer for the State of Palestine said her people's environmental rights are threatened by the depletion of natural resources, as well as pollution, created by the Israel's occupation. The occupation has caused environmental damage in occupied Palestine and East Jerusalem. She asked the Special Rapporteur if there is a legal environmental protection framework for those who are forced to live under occupation.\n\nMr. BOYD, responding, said public participation is at the heart of climate action. He cited good practices, such as the Aarhus Convention of 1998, a regional treaty on public participation and access to justice in environmental matters. The EscazA agreement covers similar issues in Latin America and the Caribbean, although it is not yet in force because only six countries have ratified it. Responding to concerns raised by the representatives of the Czech Republic and the European Union regarding environmental rights defenders, he said that more than 200 defenders are murdered every year, with many thousands more harassed and criminalized. The United Nations declaration on their rights must be implemented. States can aid in this regard by treating human rights defenders not as te"

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Gar Jackson of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nGar Jackson\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for the Intellicheck Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call.\n\nBefore we get started, I will take a few minutes to read the forward-looking statement.

Management will use the term adjusted EBITDA in today's call. Please refer to the company's press release issued this afternoon for further definition, reconciliation and context for the use of this term.\n\nWe will begin today's call with Bryan Lewis, Intellicheck's Chief Executive Officer; and then Bill White, Intellicheck's Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the Q3 financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take questions from our analysts and institutional investors.\n\nToday's call will be limited to 1 hour, and I will now turn the call over to Bryan.\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nThank you, Gar, and thank you to everyone for joining the Intellicheck Q3 2019 Earnings Call.\n\nAs usual, I am very excited to be hosting this call because, as you can see from the numbers, the changes we have made since I came on board are working and are fueling our steady progress towards our goal of profitability and beyond. As I will discuss in my prepared remarks, we are a far different company than when I started in February of 2018. I'll begin by highlighting some of the numbers from the quarter.\n\nTotal revenue was up 24% sequentially versus Q2 2019 and up 86% year-over-year. More importantly, SaaS revenue was up 40% over Q2 2019, 89% since year-end 2018 and 140% versus the same quarter last year, while at the same time, our EBITDA loss is down almost 43% from Q2 2019 and down 57% versus the same period last year. Things continue to move in the right direction. These are impressive SaaS growth numbers that were driven by refocusing our sales efforts on the companies, primarily banks and credit card issuers, that are bearing the cost of fraud. I am proud of the team, and I know they are proud of their accomplishments. I'm equally excited to say that we believe we are just getting started.\n\nIdentity theft is not going away. And we believe that will continue to drive demand for our services. In the first half of 2019, there were 3,800 breaches exposing 4.1 billion records. This amount of data means that knowledge-based authentication or KBA, by itself, will not cut it anymore. The documents and identifying information that have been historically relied upon to authenticate who you are have become just too easy to obtain for the fraudsters. Addresses, license information, social security numbers, credit information, medical records, it's all out there and easily obtainable. This is one of the reasons why the FTC sought comments on their proposed identity theft rules.\n\n31 state attorneys generals banded together to write a letter opposing some of these changes, specifically on KBA stating \There is a growing concern that, in today's world, identity thieves can now overcome knowledge-based authentication questions either because the questions are weak or the answers are readily available online or previously compromised from a data breach.\""\n\nAt Intellicheck, our premise and one that is being adopted more and more is that the first step in an authentication process must be to authenticate that the government issued ID card presented is real with near 100% certainty, and that is exactly what we do, on average over 78,000 times a day and growing for our retail and banking clients where we host the software.\n\nAs I've said on past calls, we have been focusing on financial services and with good reason. They have the financial pain point and benefit most from stopping identity theft. For those of you who are new to the story, I will explain the main areas we are used and how it is done. The data is out there, and that personal information is for sale on most of all of us. And as I have said, my personal information has been involved in 5 data sales this year alone. And it is exceptionally cheap.\n\nExperian, a global leader in consumer and business credit reporting and marketing services suggests that social security numbers can be bought for $1, driver's license information for $20. When you think about it, a driver's license and social security number are all you need to open an account. All that criminal needs is driver's license with his or her photo on it and your information. There are multiple websites on both the public and dark web where these fake licenses can be cheaply and easily purchased. Now they can go shopping.\n\nNew account openings using stolen information account for an estimated $3.6 billion in losses in 2018. This does not include the 300 hours it will take the victim to clear their name and credit report or the loss of the retailer as 69% of consumers blame the retailer and change their shopping habits.\n\nWhat makes it so easy? Think about most times you make a significant purchase at a retailer. They typically ask you if you would like to open a private label or store-branded charge account. The criminals know this and accept the offer to open an account. All they need is the social security number, income and a driver's license, all of which they bought online. In seconds, they have made an expensive purchase in your name. And since it all points to you making the purchase, you now have a 300-hour headache to clear your name.\n\nAnd often, we aren't talking small numbers here. A woman in Boston came home from vacation to a letter from the law firm telling her that she owed $48,000 on the car she never bought. It turned out that someone had stolen her identity and bought a Maserati, a Lexis and a BMW in South Florida, $200,000 in loans from TD Bank, BMW Financial and SunTrust. The second way that criminals steal for you is by shopping where you have an existing private label credit card account and they engage in a card-not-present transaction. I don't carry a lot of credit cards around, but I do like the perks and the points. When I do make a purchase, I just tell them, I do not have my cards, so they look it up.\n\nAll they ask from me is my license and the last 4 of my social security number. The criminals do the same, and again, the onus is on me to clear my name. The loss estimated as a result of these fraudulent transactions for card-not-present are expected to amount to about $130 billion between now and 2023.\n\nThe third main area where we help retailers combat fraud is non-receipted returns. Studies here suggest retailers use $9.7 billion a year with the National Retail Foundation reporting that each incident costs a retailer $1,700 on average. The perpetrators here are generally organized crime rings returning stolen goods for gift cards that are easily and quickly monetized. But it's not just the retailers, let's look at the banks. At the retail branch, criminals will pose as you to empty your account. For example, at the end of September, a man walked into an Ohio Fifth Third Bank branch posing as a Florida business owner whose company had an Ohio location.\n\nHe withdrew $7,000 from that business account using a fraudulent license. All this is quickly and easily stopped with our technology. A quick scan of license and Intellicheck technology solution authenticates a license, stopping the criminals, or almost as importantly to our clients, speeds up the transaction or acquisition of good customers with a higher lifetime value in a near frictionless manner. Our clients are realizing the truth of this, which is why we're expanding not only with existing clients, but within new clients.\n\nNow let's talk about some of our wins. As I discussed on the last call, I will name the banks by number to help everyone keep track of them. Bank #1 continues to be one of our biggest supporters in references. As I mentioned on the last call, we've been in discussions with them about other areas in the bank that can use our authentication services.\n\nThis month, they will be deploying our web-based authentication product to their fraud call centers. This product has been well received in the call center space as it requires no integration, just a user name and a password for the call center employee and they can be instantly authenticated. We are also in discussion with them regarding possible bank branch deployment in late 2020.\n\nBank #2 saw a 75% sequential revenue growth over Q2, driven by the new pay per scan pricing model and the addition of multiple retailers, representing 1,258 new locations between July and the end of October.\n\nBank #3 finally got their first implementations done and brought live a 1,000-plus location electronics retail chain in October. Additionally, they are planning to deploy our Intellicheck technology solution to their 700-plus branch locations by the second quarter of 2020.\n\nBank #4 was a very busy bank this quarter. We saw a 136% increase in revenue over Q2 2019, driven by their call centers for their own branded credit cards as a continued deployment to additional retail call centers. They deployed our authentication services to their 750 branch locations at the end of the quarter and brought live 2 of their retailers. They are also going live this month with our web product for their auto loan division, a new vertical market for us.\n\nWe are currently discussing additional retail partners and how this bank might sell our authentication services to their other banking clients.\n\nBank #5, the neo bank is, as I said on the last call, not expected to be high revenue, but is proven to be a successful test of the integration with our facial recognition partner.\n\nI'm also very pleased to say that we now have a bank 6. Bank 6 is actually a fintech company and a 700-plus location provider of a payday and unsecured installment loans. They expect to be live in all locations by year-end.\n\nWe are also seeing growth from a couple of retailers who pay us directly. We saw a 51% revenue growth at the office supply retailer who uses us for non-receipted returns. The 3,000-plus locations department store retailer, where we only parse and fill out the application, not authenticate, drove a 51% increase in revenue over Q2 as they completed deployment to all locations. In addition, as we had planned when we sold a parsing-only solution, we are now in discussions with this retailer's bank regarding how we can pilot authentication and start stopping fraud.\n\nWe started a pilot with a 580-location department store chain, which is going very well and full deployment is expected by the end of Q1. This retailer is paying us directly as they take the loss on card-not-present and non-receipted return transactions. We are currently in discussions with their bank about adding account openings in 2020. This is currently a limited store fixed-fee pilot that will convert to a per scan model once the pilot is over.\n\nWe just finished integration with the automotive dealership digital compliance important platform that I spoke about last call. This opens up over 500 auto dealerships as potential clients as we pursue this new vertical market through logical partnerships. Sales of Age ID continue to be strong. In Q3, we brought on board 88 new clients with 3 of them being law enforcement, bringing the total number of law enforcement agencies using Age ID to 65 with 21 at the state enforcement level.\n\nAnother important development expands our footprint outside the U.S. We now have multiple retailers in Canada using our authentication tools, which is a first for us. Another important development is the exceptional track record we have realized with our implementation team.\n\nI'm very pleased to report that under Bill White, the implementation team has been a complete and total success. So far in 2019, we have done 36 integrations with retailers and banks, compare that to 3 in all of 2018.\n\nAs we look at the change that we've implemented, you will likely remember that I discussed on the last call that with a per scan model, we would be introducing some cyclicality to our revenues. While the data for the statistics that follows is based on a limited number of retailers we had with a full year -- a full deployment at all stores, the scan volume suggests that 21% of annual scans come in Q1, 23% in Q2 and Q3, and 33% in Q4. As we have more and more clients fully deployed for a full cycle, we will refine these numbers.\n\nLooking towards the upcoming year, we are excited about our robust pipeline of implementation for 2020, but we still have a lot of work to do. I started one of my first earnings calls as CEO saying that we believe that the market was coming our way, and I believe we were correct, and it still is. Identity theft is not going away. Against the backdrop of unrelenting criminal thoughts on financial data and the record-setting pace of data breaches, the need to prove you are who you say you are is only going to grow and where you need to prove it expands. This is a very large market, and we are just beginning to penetrate it. All this adds up to what we believe are exciting prospects for Intellicheck.\n\nAs you look at where we had been and where we are today, I believe you'll agree that we are a drastically different company than we were when I started. Our redefined focus on who we sell to, how we sell and how quickly we implement are bringing clear results that we believe will continue into 2020. These are the things that keep me so excited about Intellicheck.\n\nWith that, I will turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results in more detail.\n\nBill White\n\nThank you, Bryan, and a good day to our shareholders, guests and listeners. I'd like to discuss some of the financial information that was contained in our press release for the third quarter ending September 30, 2019, which we released this afternoon.\n\nThe company plans to file our Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission next week. I'll begin with our third quarter results. Revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2019, grew 86% to $1,930,000 versus $1,040,000 for the same period last year. Our record SaaS revenue was approximately $1,564,000 for Q3 of 2019, a 140% increase from $651,000 in Q3 of 2018, and a 40% sequential increase from approximately $1.121 million in Q2 of 2019.\n\nGross profit as a percentage of revenue was 86.6% for the quarter ended September 30, 2019, compared to 89.1% for the quarter ended September 30, 2018. Operating expenses, which consist of selling, general and administrative and research and development expense increased 8% or $170,000 to $2,252,000 versus $2,082,000. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in development personnel to support our growth and an annual incentive bonus plan, which is contingent upon achieving certain goals established by the Board of Directors and Compensation Committee. The company posted a net loss of $568,000 for the 3 months ended September 30, 2019 compared to a net loss of $1,131,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2018.\n\nThe net loss per diluted share was $0.04 versus $0.07 in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended September 30, 2019, improved significantly to a negative $457,000 compared to a negative $1,048,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2018. Interest and other income were negligible for the quarters ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.\n\nNow I'd like to focus on the company's liquidity and capital resources. As of September 30, 2019, the company had cash of $2.8 million, working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities of $2.6 million, total assets of $13.4 million and stockholders' equity of $11.2 million. During the 9 months ended September 30, 2019, the company used net cash of $1.6 million compared to a net cash used of $2.6 million during the 9 months ended September 30, 2018.\n\nNet cash used by operating activities was $2.1 million for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2019, compared to $3.2 million for the same period in 2018. Net cash provided by investing activities was $15,000 for the 9 months ending September 30, 2019, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $102,000 for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2018.\n\nWe generated cash of $456,000 from financing activities for the 9 months ending September 30, 2019, compared to $688,000 for the same period last year. On February 6, 2019, the company entered into a revolving facility with Citibank. This agreement allows for maximum borrowings of $2 million secured by collateral accounts and bears interest at Citibank's base rate minus 2%. As of today, there are no amounts outstanding under this facility. The company currently anticipates that our available cash as well as expected cash from operations and available under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\n\nAs of September 31, 2018, the company had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $15 million.\n\nI'll now turn the call over to the operator to take your questions. Operator?\n\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Mike Grondahl with Northland Securities.\n\nMike Grondahl\n\nCongratulations on really nice revenue growth. Which bank, is it bank 4, that really sticks out the most for you guys where you're calling out that 136% increase in revenues and they're of embracing the branches, retailers and web. Do you see other banks sort of eventually getting there too?\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nENTITY. Thanks, Mike, for the compliment. We do. That particular bank, I will say, is -- they seem to be very technically savvy. It's funny in talking to them, they think they move slow. I'm comparing them to some of our other banks that move at [indiscernible] but they clearly see the value of what they're doing. That's why -- what we do for them, and that's why they are looking for every place that they can put in the authentication. So where they see fraud, they're looking to figure out which one of our tools they can put in there to stop it.\n\nMike Grondahl\n\nAnd secondly, like you highlighted bank 6, this fintech company, but are they -- which I think you're highlighting it because they're close to implementation and you signed them and all of that. But do banks 7, 8 and 9, are they in the funnel in a kind of only a matter of time before you can talk about them? Or what does that pipeline look like?\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nENTITY, we're pretty much talking to every issuer out there, and they're all trying to figure out how to get there. That bank that is -- that 3,000 store that's behind them, they're talking about pilots be able to check the efficacy of the authentication. So they're one also very, very large credit card issuer. We've got other banks that are talking to us that, all they care, they don't do credit cards, but they're getting hit in their branches.\n\nWe've got, again, a lot of these payday uncollateralized loan folks who are getting hit for upwards of $2,500 on a loan that are very interested in it. And many of these folks are looking at that web product that we have because it's instantaneous for them. There's no integration needed. So I would say at the pipeline -- I'm very happy with the pipeline that Paul and his team have out there for us.\n\nMike Grondahl\n\nGot it. Maybe just lastly, was there anything lumpy in 3Q? Or would you call that pretty core driven? And then related to that, your statement about the, what you say, the scans being 33% in the fourth quarter, that would imply you're kind of comfortable with revenue growing sequentially again?\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nENTITY, I don't -- there was nothing lumpy, there was no major hardware purchases or anything like that in Q3. There was just very good sequential SaaS growth brought about by a couple things. Part of it being bank #2 going to the per scan model versus a very low per store model. And then also just bringing on more and more retail locations.\n\nOur next question is from the line of Scott Buck with B. Riley FBR.\n\nScott Buck\n\nI was curious -- I know that the scan count steps up here in the fourth quarter with the seasonality. Does that slow the pace of implementations in the fourth quarter? I mean, are retailers or, I guess, your financial service customers kind of shutting you off until Q1? Or will you continue to implement throughout the quarter?\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nBy and large, no retailer wants to touch their point-of-sale system post October. As you look at the amount of money that Target lost on one Sunday during the summer when their point-of-sale system went down. Nobody wants to see something like that catastrophic happen during their big period. So the retailers aren't -- the bank branches, they don't really care. So we are continuing to roll out retail branches. But post October 31, the retailers all lock down.\n\nScott Buck\n\nGot it. That makes sense. And second, in terms of the kind of 6 bank -- co-banks that you have signed currently. If you were to exhaust all the potential revenue options with those 6, what kind of pipeline does that give you in terms of revenue, and I guess, time line in terms of implementation?\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nSo one of the things that we did was kind of sized the market comparing it to clients that we have. We know the major credit card issuers, we know whose programs they run. And when we looked at retailers where they run the programs for that -- like other clients we have, where we know that we could help. We look at that market as between $180 million and $250 million in annual SaaS revenue. That is then predicated on getting all those retailers up and on the system.\n\nSo that could take quite a while. It also doesn't account for any revenue that we might be bringing in toward the bank's own branded credit cards. The retail branches or, again, as you start to go into other areas where they're giving out loans, like the automotive, that was purely -- $180 million to $250 million is purely for private label credit cards. So the market is, I think, pretty large.\n\n[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Amy Norflus with Neuberger Berman.\n\nAmy Norflus\n\nI'm sorry, I came in a little late so I missed the prepared remarks and there's no transcript yet. I have the experience where I went into Best Buy, I didn't have my card. They asked for my license and then they ran some scans. And when I spoke with the associate there, he said this is a rollout from corporate. I asked them if they had anything to do with you, but they, I guess, the associate wasn't well versed on it. Can you kind of tell me if that's you? I mean, I don't know if you also mentioned Best Buy because we use large retail electronics, but can you kind of tell me a little bit about that?\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nWe are under NDAs with our clients. So we can't go out and say their name. But I will say that in the prepared remarks, I did discuss a 1,000-plus location large retail electronics chain.\n\nAmy Norflus\n\nOkay. And so this is mandate. So this is -- we should expect to see this from other retailers where it's like, when you tell us the number or the chain, it will be rolled out and it'll be standard, and it's on a pay per scan basis?\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nENTITY, that's the way everybody is using it. Once it's out there, they use it for all purposes. And so since it's integrated into their point-of-sale system, that's exactly what they do to stop the fraud, is they're going to scan the license. And again, the use case is non-receipted returns. They certainly will scan it also, card not present, I forgot my license, or I want to open up credit account, they'll scan for all those purposes.\n\nAmy Norflus\n\nAnd would you find the results at expectations or better than expectations? How do you estimate it?\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nIn terms of estimating what? I'm sorry.\n\nAmy Norflus\n\nSo you went into this retail and you're just like, okay, we estimate x number of scans, and now that the scans have been happening...\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nENTITY. ENTITY. ENTITY. Most of them tend to be rather upfront about the scans. This particular retailer doing on order of about 20,000 scans a day.\n\nAmy Norflus\n\nAnd you see it on a real-time basis? So they scan and you automatically see it in corporate that there was a scan or...\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nENTITY, we have been doing -- ENTITY, it's a real time. It gets recorded. It comes back to the API, comes back to our software in the cloud. We run the authentication. We parse the data, send it back to them. We clear the PII out of our system, but we keep a record of scan, date, location, store number and what was the result, was it a good license, a fraudulent license or an expired license.\n\nAmy Norflus\n\nDid you give numbers as to how many are fraudulent and how many you've saved? I don't know the right terminology. How many frauds you...\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nOff the top of my head, I don't know what this particular retailer's fraud rate is. I think it was -- last I saw was somewhere just over 1%, last time I ran the numbers. But I hadn't looked at an extended period. The range of fraud runs anywhere from -- for -- the longer a store has our stuff in place, the fraud goes down.\n\nSo for our long-running stores, we average about 0.6% of the time, there is a fraudulent license. We have -- some of the high end retailers we have, over 5% of the time they scan a license, they are fraudulent. So it really depends, jewelry stores have higher fraud rates than your small -- your lower-end retailer. So it's sort of by industry, the numbers are slightly different.\n\nAmy Norflus\n\nAnd are you allowed to take these results and market it to other prospective clients and say, \""Look, these are the results we have from this person or person x and we can promise you to show these results.\"" So [indiscernible] that information and using it for marketing?\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nNo, not at all. And the good thing is, just not every single one of our clients is willing to get on the phone with any other client or prospect that we have to tell them how good we are and what we've done for their fraud. Like, for example, that -- I talked about on the call, we started a pilot with 580-store department store chain. They came to us because one of our other clients was talking the fraud people, risk people we're talking, and this 580-store chain said what do you guys do?\n\nAnd they're like, \""Go talk to Intellicheck, it stops it.\"" So the clients are -- they all look at it as we are fighting fraud together. So they are very happy to band together and talk about what they're doing. They just don't want it out in the press release, which is unfortunate, but they're all -- we're going to have them all in our offices, most of our large clients. They want to get together and see how other users of our technology are using it, make sure that they're getting the best use case out of it. So by and large, we have very happy clients that are willing and able to help us sell to other clients.\n\nAmy Norflus\n\nAnd are you seeing the same fraudulent IDs through various channels? Or I mean, like if you pick up John Jones, do you find the similar ID being used in 2 or 3 locations? If they're not used at yours, do they try somewhere else? I mean, can you do any data stats behind the IDs that are coming in and where -- locations or geographies, or is there anything to garner about that?\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nWe currently have -- we don't save the data on -- that would allow us to say that it's the same license. Because to do that, we have to save some of the PIIs. But we plan on doing, in 2020 is hashing the data so that there's nothing there, but we would know that we're seeing this particular license multiple times. We wouldn't know their name or anything, but we could tell. I mean, the point of that is we want to be able to give out alerts to our retailers and banks that we're seeing a lot of frauds coming in from ex state or we're seeing a lot of fraud picking up in a specific state. So have your people be aware.\n\nAmy Norflus\n\nAnd then are you allowed to -- the person has given you the fraudulent ID, are you allowed to use their image so that you can say, at 203 register 7, somebody had fraudulent ID, and oh, by the way, we have a picture of this person?\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nWe don't save the image because what we're doing is scanning the back of the license. Some of our clients, particularly bank number 4 with the web tool. When they send a text to the client, the prospect is looking for a credit card, we scan the back of the license, authenticate it. They also ask the user to take a photo of the front of their license, and we send that to the bank, but we don't store any of that.\n\nAmy Norflus\n\nNo, I would say, the flip there. So if I went to the register and I try to use fraudulent ID, most registrants have cameras, are you working with the retailers and the cameras to get the images of these people that are trying to -- I mean, I just don't know where it goes. But I mean, it's another...\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nENTITY. We haven't talked to the loss prevention people about that. I think a lot of the time, what we're finding is that the sales clerk at the store is trained to just try and get that person out of the store as quickly as possible. Generally, they'll just say \""I can't scan this ID, do you have another form of identification.\"" Usually, the bad guy knows they're caught, they take the license and they walk as quickly as possible to the door.\n\nAmy Norflus\n\nBut if you were to work with fraud prevention, there's nothing that -- you don't get any sort of royalty because you identified the fraudster?\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nNo,\n\nAmy Norflus\n\nOkay. I'm sorry, last question. The scans, so if you do more than 20 or 30 or x number of scans, does the price per scan go up or down? Or is there some sort of scale or something like that? Probably it goes down, I guess.\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nENTITY, we scale. When you start to hit your first million scans a month, your second million scans a month, that kind of thing. So there is -- our whole point in the per scan model and having tranches of different pricing was, we want the banks to be incentivized to bring as many of their retailers on board as possible. And I don't care where the scan comes from the bank, it's just the scan. So it can come from 5 or 1 retailer, I don't care. So what we wanted to do is make sure that the more retailers they brought on board, although they'll be paying us more, their marginal cost of reducing fraud or eliminating fraud goes down.\n\nNext question comes from the line of Jeff Kobylarz "

Make sure the keypad does not seems to be abrupt i.e. be watchful of the fact that there is no deployment of any skimming device on to the machine as it can then keep note of the transaction you execute such as memorize the Pin number you enter and other crucial details.\n\n2. Make it a point to stand close to the machine as there may be some disguised individuals who may be unknowingly keen to note your important card details.\n\n3. Do not share your PIN with others and also do not note it on the card itself. It is at best to memorize the same.\n\n4.

As a security measure, while banking apps do by 2-factor authentication, you are advised to keep different password for your net banking and mobile banking account. Infact there is a m-PIN while you carry out banking transaction over mobile. Avoid sharing it with anyone. As a matter of cautions, the banks do not allow the installation of banking app on any other phone other than which is registered with the bank.\n\n2. Do not go by the auto-save option as it unknowingly may give way to a fraudulent transaction. So do not click on the tab saying ' remember password'.\n\n3. Do ensure to get notification from your bank and always make it a point to check them as in case there is any login failure you shall be notified and for the same you can take an action.\n\n4. Use updated mobile apps and for this you can do such settings so that the apps can get updated automatically when the Wi-fi connection is enabled.\n\nGoodReturns.in\n\nMore MOBILE BANKING News Now India Post Savings Account To Offer Mobile Banking Solution Revamped ICICI Banks' iMobile App: What More It Offers?

Yes Bank,0,"Mumbai : The government has ordered a probe by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) into the affairs of CG Power and Industrial Solutions and its associate entities after the regional director (RD) (western region) submitted a report to the MCA concluding to have allegedly found certain instances of alleged 'related party' transactions and 'suspected funds diversion' which requires a thorough probe by the SFIO, people in the know told ET. Sources said that the RD's probe has also mentioned that the statements given by ousted chairman Gautam Thapar and chief financial officer VR Venkatesh were 'not satisfactory'. \""The probe had found certain instances of funds being transferred to the promoter's company. When Thapar was confronted with the same, he refused to give satisfactory replies,\"" added one of the officials cited above. There was no response from Thapar or the company to a query on this matter from ET. According to source the MCA probe has indicated a suspicious diversion of over Rs 2,000 crore by certain erstwhile directors and key managerial executives. \""Funds have been transferred to related and connected entities like Ballarpur International, Mirabelle, Solaris and few others without the board's approval. Even the company was kept in the dark when these transactions were carried out under the knoweldge of a few selected executives,\"" added the official. Sources close to the development told ET that the company's board has already mandated a more in-depth forensic investigation of these transactions. The company's board has taken control of the management and removed Thapar and Venkatesh from their respective positions for their alleged role in financial fraud; chief executive officer KN Neelkant has resigned. CG has appointed Ashish Kumar Guha as chairman of the board of directors, and set up a Special Situation Committee (SSC) to resolve the issues faced by the company. As on March-end, CG had a total domestic debt of Rs 2,349 crore, international debt of Rs 1,215 crore, and another Rs 463 crore contingent debt due to review process. While CG is in talks with banks to restructure the term debt, the company is in dire need of working capital. In the current environment, as Indian lenders deal with huge stressed assets, they are unlikely to restructure the debt of a company where the promoter has come under the scanner.

Yes Bank,0,"\""Under SBI's leadership, once the company gets some priority funds and restoration of existing lines of credit, the operations can get to full swing,\"" Seshadri said. \""We need to understand one thing here. This is a case of fraud on the company and... Mumbai:The board of fraud-hit CG Power & Industrial Solutions has sought a moratorium of 18-24 months from lenders to help revive the company and repay its \""legitimate\"" loans. A plan is being worked out with the lenders, Narayan Seshadri, independent director and now one of the custodians overseeing the company's resurrection, said in an exclusive interaction with ET for the first time since the fraud was discovered in August.\n\n\""We intend to pay back every penny of all legitimate loans. We just need time to revive the company. We have sought a moratorium of around 18-24 months to repay loans that the company is falling behind on,\"" he said.\n\nWorking capital providers and lenders such as State Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, ENTITY, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank and others are hugely supportive, he said.\n\n\""Under SBI's leadership, once the company gets some priority funds and restoration of existing lines of credit, the operations can get to full swing,\"" Seshadri said. \""We need to understand one thing here. This is a case of fraud on the company and not by the company. Money was taken out of a healthy company that was generating close to 300-400 crore of Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) for consecutive years.\""\n\nAccording to him, the board is concentrating on three broad areas to revive the company - getting lenders to help with short-term funds, talking with institutional investors to pump in capital and building up the top management team.\n\nThe company's equity investors - mutual funds, KKR, L&T Finance, Sunil Bharti Mittal Holdings and special situation funds, among others, have been approached to invest incremental equity in the company.\n\n\""Our investment bankers are talking to potential equity investors and we have a positive feedback from there, and we will look at issuing fresh equity and raise funds for the company,\"" said Seshadri, who also sits on the board of AstraZeneca Pharma, PI Industries and Magma Fincorp. \""Our shareholders, too, have been very supportive... they have lost value.

The company is looking at selling land in suburban Mumbai's Kanjurmarg to raise 490 crore, while the CG House in Mumbai is estimated to fetch about 220 crore.\n\n\""We hope to raise capital from existing and new investors,\"" Seshadri said. The plan is to create liquidity of 1,200-1,600 crore.\n\nSeshadri said the financials are so intertwined and complicated that the board has to get down to micro issues to save costs. \""The royalty to Avantha Group as a percentage of turnover has been stopped, leading to almost 75 crore in savings per year,\"" he said. \""Such small efforts add up to a lot of savings eventually.\""\n\nIn August, the board of CG Power said it will restate accounts after discovering \""significant accounting irregularities\"" and governance lapses. Gautam Thapar, the promoter and chairman, was removed by the board and efforts are on to deleverage the company, sell non-core assets and restart and optimise operations.\n\nTo understand the extent of fraud, three independent forensic audits have been commissioned by the SBI, Reserve Bank of India and the board.\n\n\""The entire liquidity of the company was sucked out. Our efforts are on to pump in liquidity in the company,\"" Seshadri said. SBI Caps, the investment banking arm of SBI, is helping the lenders with a corrective action plan.\n\nBased on the findings of the forensic audits, the board will decide whether to press recovery and other charges against some individuals, but it's too early to predict how things will pan out, Seshadri said.\n\nThe other task is to find the right talent to manage the company after the top deck of the company was asked to leave following the fraud."

Meanwhile, IndiGo and Qatar Airways have signed a one-way codeshare agreement giving the middle-eastern carrier further access into the Indian market.\n\n(Source: Financial Express)\n\n3. Can Think of Taking 'Further Decision' If Firm Indication Given on 'Core Interests': MEA on RCEP\n\nIndia on Thursday, 7 November, said if it gets a \""firm indication\"" that its core interests will be accommodated in the RCEP trade deal then it can think of taking a \""further decision\"" on the issue. The assertion by the Ministry of External Affairs came two days after Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal indicated that India is open for negotiations if the member countries of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) come up with a better offer which can address concerns and provide greater market access for domestic industries.\n\nHe, however, had said that for the present, it is the final decision of the government that India will not join the China-backed mega free trade agreement.\n\n(Source: PTI)\n\n4.

PSU Banks Loan Melas Push Non-Food Credit Growth; Outstanding Loans Inch Closer to Rs 100 Lakh Crore\n\nThe non-food credit growth in the banking system stood at 8.79 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) for the fortnight ended 7 November, the highest in the last three fortnights, following the lending \""outreach programmes\"" by public-sector banks (PSBs). Between 11 and 25 October, non-food credit grew 0.4 percent to Rs 97.68 lakh crore, according to the provisional data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\n\nThe loan carnivals were organised in two phases, with the first leg from 1 and 9 October and the second one from 21 to 25 October.

Tussle Between Traders, FMCG Firms Worsens Over Differential Pricing\n\nAn ongoing stir involving fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies and distributors in Gujarat over differential product pricing and low margins is threatening to go national. This comes as the Federation of All India Distributors Association (FAIDA), which comprises 24 member state bodies, steps in to lend support to the agitation, which has seen the Gujarat-based distributors boycott products of a few companies for the past few days.\n\nCompanies whose products have not been picked up for distribution in the state under a \""non-cooperation movement\"" include Marico, Dabur, Emami, Britannia, Reckitt Benckiser (RB), and Godrej Consumer Products. These firms, distributors allege, have been supplying directly to modern trade and e-tailers, bypassing them.\n\n(Source: Business Standard)\n\n7. Tatas Set for Long-Drawn-Out Battle Over Licence of Trusts\n\nThe dispute over the cancellation of registration of six Tata Trusts is set to be a protracted legal battle, as the trusts and tax officials differ over the end date of the registration, and whether it was a cancellation or a surrender.\n\nWhile the charitable trusts said they surrendered their registration in February 2015, the tax department, which cancelled the registration in October 2019, said that there was no legal provision for surrendering the registration.\n\nAlso, if October 2019 is taken to be the end of the registration, the tax department can demand much higher tax from the trusts, because the Income Tax Act (I-T Act) did not permit taxing \""accreted income\"" before 2016.\n\n(Source: Livemint)\n\n8. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das Says Closely Monitoring Situation at PMC Bank; Forensic Audit Underway\n\nReserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on Thursday, 7 November, said it is closely monitoring the situation at scam-hit PMC Bank and a forensic audit is underway. Punjab & Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC Bank), among the top 10 urban cooperative banks in the country, was placed under an RBI administrator on 23 September for six months due to massive under-reporting of dud loans. \""PMC Bank situation is being closely monitored. Forensic audit is underway in PMC Bank case,\"" Das told reporters after a meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) here.\n\nRBI had imposed withdrawal restrictions on account-holders after it found alleged irregularities to the tune of Rs 4,355 crore due to diversion of money to infrastructure firm HDIL. On Tuesday, the apex bank enhanced the cash withdrawal limit to Rs 50,000 per account, which was the fourth such increase since PMC Bank was placed under its direct control.\n\n(Source: PTI)\n\n9. Cognizant to Hire 23,000 From Indian Institutes in 2020, Says India CMD\n\nNasdaq-listed information technology (IT) services company Cognizant is planning to hire around 23,000 employees from technology institutions in India during calendar year 2020, in addition to its campus hiring for business-process outsourcing (BPO) operations, according to Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, chairman and managing director of Cognizant India. He clarified that the company would continue hiring, and that the earlier job-cut announcement was but a small portion of the larger plan, considering Cognizant had around 290,000 employees globally.\n\nRamamoorthy's latest statement comes days after Cognizant said it was planning to remove around 7,000 mid-and senior-level jobs and shut down its content moderation business, which accounts for another 6,000 jobs, as part of its '2020 Fit for Growth Plan'.

Afterwards, we will open it up to your questions.\n\nAs always today's presentation includes forward-looking statements and those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially include among others, our ability to make good decisions about the monetizations of our partner companies for maximum value or at all, and the return of value to our shareholders, the ongoing support of our existing partner companies, the fact that our partner companies may vary from period to period, challenges to achieving liquidity from our partner company holdings, fluctuations in the market prices of any publicly traded company holdings, competition, our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, market valuations in sectors which our partner companies operate, our inability to control our partner companies, our need to manage our assets to avoid registration under the Investment Act of 1940, and the risks associated with our partner companies including the fact that most of our companies have a limited history and a history of operating losses, face intense competition and may never be profitable, the effect of economic conditions in the business sectors in which Safeguard's partner companies operate and the uncertainties described in our filings.\n\nMany of these factors are beyond the company's ability to predict or control. As a result of these and other factors the company's past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. During the course of today's call, words such as expect, anticipate, believe and intend will be used in our discussion of goals or events in the future.\n\nManagement cannot provide any assurance that future results will be as described in our forward-looking statements.

We have continued to do in 2019 what we started to pursue early in 2018. We have returned an aggregate of over $184 million back to our balance sheet since we began pursuing this strategy, by being patient and opportunistic.\n\nWe have now reached a meaningful milestone in the execution of this strategy. We have repaid our debt and currently we have cash of approximately $45.5 million on hand. As a result, the Safeguard Board of Directors has declared a special cash dividend of $1 per share, payable on December 30, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 23, 2019.\n\nWe expect the dividends to be characterized as a return of capital for federal tax purposes. Mark will provide some further information on that determination later in the call.\n\nTo reiterate something we have said previously, whenever we have cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet that exceed the amount, we believe is then prudent to keep on hand to operate the business and continue to support our partner companies, our Board of Directors will authorize share repurchases and/or dividends.\n\nCurrently, we believe $25 million is the appropriate amount to retain on our balance sheet. In addition to the determination regarding the dividend and then to further align interests with shareholders, the Safeguard Board of Directors also decided to reduce the size of our Board of Directors from 6 to 4 as of the next annual meeting and to pay all Board compensation in Safeguard equity.\n\nWe continue the pursuit of individual partner company exits while considering all alternatives as circumstances dictate, including among others, the sale of individual partner companies, the sale of certain partner company interests in secondary market transactions, or a combination thereof, as well as the sale of the entire company. We will also continue to consider financing transactions which could expedite the return of value to shareholders.\n\nWe remain bullish regarding our portfolio of partner companies and continue to believe that the current value of our portfolio interests, and our cash and equivalents significantly exceed our current share prices.\n\nLet me highlight some recent partner company occurrences. Recently, Syapse signed a collaboration agreement with the FDA, which will help to solidify their approach to real-world evidence collection as the industry standard. This announcement is anticipated to accelerate discussions with current and future pharma partners.\n\nAs previously announced, Syapse also entered into a deal with Pfizer to develop a precision medicine solution for oncology. This marks the third major biopharma company to partner with Syapse. Most recently, the company announced that Fletcher Payne has been appointed as the company's Chief Financial Officer.\n\nMr. Payne joined Syapse, as it is experiencing tremendous momentum driven by its new life sciences and health system partnerships, and its collaboration with the FDA. Safeguard has deployed $20.6 million into Syapse since 2014 and we own 20.1% of the company.\n\nDuring the quarter, Safeguard partner company MediaMath introduced SOURCE by MediaMath to the global marketplace. SOURCE by MediaMath is a new ecosystem that addresses fundamental challenges like fraud, single view of the customer and commercial term transparency to name a few.\n\nThe reception by external audiences has been strong and the company is looking forward to seeing this momentum continue. Furthermore, MediaMath was recently named as a leader in the 2019 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Ad Tech. Notably, MediaMath in that quadrant is ranked ahead of Google in its ability to execute.\n\nThe company also is ranked ahead of Amazon, The Trade Desk and Verizon for market vision. Overall, MediaMath attained the highest upper right composite score for market leadership and vision.\n\nAs the company continues to roll out SOURCE, this Gartner Magic Quadrant assessment should provide an extra tailwind, as it transforms the digital advertising ecosystem. Safeguard has deployed $15.5 million in MediaMath, and we own 13.4% of the company.\n\nWe have accomplished a lot under our new strategy, including streamlining our internal operations to reduce costs, repaying our debt and moving forward with strategic transactions involving our partner companies that have returned significant capital back to Safeguard, which has also allowed us to retire our debt and implement our return of capital program.\n\nWe are pleased with what we have accomplished, but much work is left to be done. We continue to work with other partner companies on potential exits and hope to have more news to share in the coming months.\n\nOn our last quarterly call we indicated that we were highly confident of additional exit activity in 2019. We were recently informed that the exit we were referring to is going to take longer than previously anticipated and the contemplated transaction will likely not occur by the end of the year. The delay was not due to company performance as the company is performing above plan and we hope to be in a position to provide further information in the near future.\n\nAs I described above as additional equity from additional exits is returned to our balance sheet, we will return the excess to our shareholders as soon as practical in the form of repurchase and/or dividends. We believe that our partner company interests will continue to mature and attract strategic and financial buyer attention as we continue to explore the exit alternatives we referenced above.\n\nNow, I'll turn the call over to Mark for a review of the quarter's financial results.\n\nMark Herndon\n\nThank you, Brian. Our third quarter resulted in a net loss of $2.5 million, or $0.12 per share on a basic and fully diluted basis as compared with net income of $32.1 million, or $1.56 per share for the same quarter of 2018. Our year-to-date results are net income of $55.3 million, or $2.68 per share on a basic and fully diluted basis as compared with net income of $1 million, or $0.05 per share for the same 9 month period in 2018.\n\nOur third quarter results were highlighted by continued reductions in general and administrative costs as compared to prior periods the full repayment of our prior credit facility and non-cash gains resulting from certain equity holdings. Our year-to-date results also benefited from the second quarter's $50 million gain from the transaction as well as the first quarter's $34.9 million gain from the Propeller transaction.\n\nSafeguard's cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and securities at September 30, 2019, totaled $45.6 million compared to $46.2 million at 2018's year-end. In July, we made a final principal and interest repayment of $49.5 million to repay our debt facility in full, which relieves us of our prior restriction from repurchasing shares or declaring dividends. As we indicated the board has now declared a $1 per share special dividend for shareholders of record at December 23, 2019.\n\nIn regards to the taxability of this special dividend, we have recently completed an analysis of the cumulative and year-to-date earnings and profits. As a result of that analysis we believe that the special dividend will be characterized as a return of capital for federal tax purposes. However, I should emphasize that the final determination of this characterization can only be made once the calendar year is complete. There remains the possibility of additional transactions including possible transactions involving our partner companies that could impact this determination.\n\nOur third quarter's general and administrative expenses were $2.3 million compared to $3.5 million for the same quarter of 2018. This lower level of general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of the absence of the $1 million severance charge in the prior third quarter as well as the lower overall level of staffing, lower office rent costs and lower professional fees.\n\nOur general and administrative expenses for the 9 months ended September 30, 2019, were $7.9 million as compared to $14.3 million for the comparable 2018 period. Similarly the lower level of year-to-date general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of the absence in 2019 of the $3.8 million severance charge that was taken in 2018 as well as the lower professional fees incurred in 2019.\n\nCorporate expenses, which exclude interest, depreciation, severance stock-based compensation and other non-recurring items were $1.9 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2019, and $6 million for the 2019 year-to-date period. These amounts are lower than the $2.2 million and $8 million in the 3 and 9 months ended September 30, 2018 due primarily to the lower level of staffing and related office costs. We continue to believe that corporate costs for 2019 will be at or below the low end of the previously stated $8 million to $9 million target that was announced in early 2018. We are pleased about the reduced level of spending in 2019 and we will continue to work towards continuing to decrease costs where possible.\n\nWith respect to our partner company holdings, we have 15 partner companies representing an aggregate cost of $206.1 million and having a carrying value of $62.8 million at September 30, 2019. During the third quarter, we deployed $3.8 million of capital to 4 existing partner companies. The most individually significant being a $2 million deployment to Syapse and a $1.5 million deployment to Aktana. Subsequent to the quarter, we also deployed an additional $1.75 million to Moxe.\n\nAs a result, our year-to-date deployments aggregate to $16.3 million. While we may make a couple of small follow-ons during the remainder of Q4, we do not expect any further material deployments during 2019. Going forward, we continue to expect our level of annual follow-on deployments will diminish and we will look to selectively deploy relatively small additional amounts into certain of our partner companies to maintain our position of influence if we continue to believe in their long-term prospects.\n\nFor the 3 months ended September 30, 2019, other income or loss improved $9.9 million as compared to the comparable 2018 quarter. 2019 included $4.1 million of income related to the decrease in the fair value of the credit facility repayment feature liability and an aggregate of $4.3 million gain for the increase in the value of 3 non-partner company equity securities based on observable price changes.\n\nI should also note that each of these other income items were non-cash. Interest expense increased $2.5 million during the quarter primarily due to [Maycol] [ph] interest payments related to the credit facility. As we've previously disclosed the last payment included a $4.1 million [Maycol] [ph] interest and $0.9 million of accrued interest. Additionally for the 3 months ended September 30, 2019, we realized $1.8 million of equity income gains on proceeds received from the amounts - from amounts held - previously withheld from prior exit transactions.\n\nAnd finally, for the 3 months ended September 30, 2019, our share of the losses of our equity method partner companies was $6.3 million as compared to $11.2 million for the comparable prior period in 2018. Our share of the losses from equity method partner companies for the 9 month period ended September 30, 2019, were $21.9 million as compared to $37.9 million for the comparable prior period.\n\nThese reductions are the result of less companies in the portfolio and more companies reducing their burn rate and trending toward cash flow breakeven. In terms of revenue guidance, we have lowered our projected range of aggregate partner company revenue for 2019 to between $355 million and $370 million for the 15 remaining partner companies. That would represent a growth rate of between 7% and 12% for the same partner companies in 2018. Excluding our digital media companies, the revenue of Safeguard's portfolio of partner companies is growing at more than 50% in aggregate year-over-year.\n\nI should also remind everyone that Safeguard reports the revenue of its equity and cost method partner companies on a 1-quarter-lag basis.\n\nNow, we're back to Brian.\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nThank you. Operator, why don't we open up the lines for any questions.\n\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nGood morning, Bob.\n\nPeter Lukas\n\nHi, good morning. Hi, good morning. It's Pete Lukas again for Bob. How are you?\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nGood.\n\nPeter Lukas\n\nJust a question on how you decided on the dividend versus repurchase, looking at your stock saying that the company value and cash are - exceed the share price, how you make that decision, then how you think about that decision going forward?\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nYeah, so, Pete, look, I think it's fair to - it's fairly obvious that whenever we're making these decisions and when we have excess capital, it's a combination of a lot of different factors that we take into account. I think what drove the decision here was the opportunity that we had to make this a return of capital dividend to be as straightforward as I can about it.\n\nPeter Lukas\n\nGot you. And then, I guess, you pretty much answered everything. The only other one is in your overall timeline on the wind down, everything is still as you've talked about in the past there?\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nYeah, no changes. We're still within the timeframes that we believe it will apply and we continue to proceed along that path. So, yeah, I think that's the correct assessment.\n\nPeter Lukas\n\nAnd then, last one for me, in terms of funding for the partner companies, you said you expected that to be down next year. Any sense on the - or diminished next year - any sense on the magnitude of that reduction?\n\nMark Herndon\n\nSure. Yeah, in terms of funding for next year, we would expect it to diminish significantly from 2019 and 2018's levels.\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nWe'll be hopefully providing a little bit better guidance when we get into the 2020 first quarter assessment and earnings call, Pete.\n\nPeter Lukas\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jim MacDonald from First Analysis. Your line is open.\n\nJames MacDonald\n\nGood morning, guys.\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nHi, Jim.\n\nJames MacDonald\n\nOn the exit activity, you say you expect something in the next couple months, but you are not highly confident anymore. Maybe a little more color on that?\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nWe're confident of continuing exit activity, obviously. But I just wanted to make sure that we clarified the expectation that we had set last quarter, because the specific transaction that we were highly confident of occurring in this timeframe is pushed off a little bit. But we would certainly expect that transaction to occur. So I'm not concerned about the situation. I'm just ENTITY of the fact that we had said in the second - or in the fourth quarter, the year we expected it to occur.\n\nJames MacDonald\n\nWe also have the MediaMath option coming up here, so any thoughts on that? And I assume MediaMath's been affected by the softness in the digital marketing area. Any thoughts on how that might affect exit at MediaMath?\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nWell, the MediaMath option expired. They did not exercise it. And I think that what I'd propose is important to remind everyone of regarding MediaMath is now they are one of only two scaled independent demand-side platforms left in the marketplace. dataxu got bought by Roku in a transaction.\n\nThey were like the third player arguably and were probably considered sub-scale. They were attractive at some level, because of their OTT and video. But they were not a complete package like a MediaMath or a Trade Desk. So I think that only means good things for MediaMath. And I know that there has been whisper in the market as to what the multiples were in that dataxu transaction and I heard 4X to 5X.\n\nIf that is correct, and I'm not in possession of any particular information regarding that transaction that anyone else isn't. But if that is the right number that is a number that would not be inappropriate to apply to figure out what MediaMath value is.\n\nJames MacDonald\n\nOkay. And maybe talk a little bit about how you determine $25 million as the cash you need to have on hand. It was a little bit lower than we had expected you would've picked.\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nWell, I'm glad we didn't disappoint you in that regard. We certainly don't want to keep excess capital when we don't need it. There's no point to that. But we're also trying to be careful and make sure that we don't get ourselves in some sort of cash bind that we don't need to get ourselves into.\n\nSo it's just some aggregate operating expenses plus some expected follow-on is really how you get there. I mean, there is - it's not magic. And we would expect that to go down over time, as we continue on through the strategy obviously. But at the moment the Board is comfortable with that kind of number, that kind of range, to keep available to us.\n\nJames MacDonald\n\nAnd just sort of two somewhat technical ones. Do you expect the partner losses to remain? Do you think the $6.3 million for this quarter is approximately where that will remain or hopefully maybe diminish over time as the companies progress?\n\nAnd the second quick one is, what's your view on further escrow prospects? Do you see any order of magnitude of how much escrow you might achieve from previous transactions?\n\nMark Herndon\n\nSure, I can address those for you. In regards to the equity method losses across 15 different companies, as you might expect, there is some level of volatility in seeing their results. But we would expect some level of consistency, as we continue to decline, as we continue to shrink the size of the portfolio.\n\nSo again, so to the extent that there are less companies in it, then that would be a factor. And if we continue to see companies trending closer to a breakeven for their own results, as they mature and develop, that would also be a factor toward reducing it. So it is a difficult number to predict going forward, but I do see a favorable trend line in that so far.\n\nIn regards to escrows, there are a variety of companies of prior transactions that have escrows outstanding. And so, we may see some relatively small activity coming through the next few quarters related to that, but it would not be dramatic results to our financial statements.\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nThe trend in most of these transactions we're doing these days, it seems that - escrows are going down in the amounts. So the amounts reserved - or the amounts held back in transactions that was typically larger back in the day. Things are being dealt with through rep and warranty insurance and things like that. So those numbers will tend to be small going forward, I think.\n\nJames MacDonald\n\nOkay. Thanks a lot guys.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joshua Horowitz with Palm Global. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nHey, Josh.\n\nJoshua Horowitz\n\nHi, Brian. Hi, Mark. Hope you're both well. Couple of questions, back in August, when you announced earnings, you said that you continue to believe the current value of the portfolio interest and cash exceed the current share price. At that time the share price was around $11.50. Do you still feel the same way today?\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nYeah, I think we said that in the scripted comments, but I'll repeat myself that. Yeah, no matter how we look at it we believe that's the case.\n\nJoshua Horowitz\n\nGreat. Any color on which of the board members might be stepping down and why that's going to happen at the next annual meeting versus end of the year or just any color around that?\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nWell, the board will go through the normal formal corporate governance process to name those people. And I'm told I need to be careful, because of the proxy solicitation rules that we need to be ENTITY of, and that mentioning names is jumping the gun insofar as proxy solicitation. So I can't say specifically. But you can probably think through how that will play out. But formal decisions will be made in the normal course of our preparation for that meeting.\n\nJoshua Horowitz\n\nThat's fair. On SG&A going forward as we shed assets is there any way to think about additional SG&A cuts? We have 15 companies today. If we have - I'm making up a number - 9 by this time next year what is our SG&A?\n\nMark Herndon\n\nRight. So it wouldn't necessarily be linear based on the number of companies. But we do expect that cost reductions will continue and, in particular, as the overall size of the portfolio decreases and exits occur, we will continue to reduce costs.\n\nJoshua Horowitz\n\nGreat. Thank you both. I appreciate your time.\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nThanks, Joshua.\n\nMark Herndon\n\n[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ron Mass with Almitas Capital. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nGood morning.\n\nRonald Mass\n\nYes. Good morning. You talked about the cash distribution versus buying shares back. And I appreciate that the dividend will be a return of capital versus taxable. But can you tell us whether you feel like you could have been buying shares in the open market? Given potential transactions in place would you have been restricted from buying shares back? Or could you have if you wanted to could you have made the decision to buy back shares in lieu of paying this dividend?\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nI think that the right answer there is we're always at risk of being limited in what we can do because of material non-public information that we have. So read into that what you will. The other part of that answer is probably that open market purchases for us are difficult, because we don't have a lot of volume in the stock too. So it's not necessarily the most efficient way to do that. But those things as well as tender offers for stock, et cetera, will always be something that we're considering as we have that excess capital bucket to deliver out to you guys.\n\nRonald Mass\n\nCan you give us a sense for to do - be able to do tender offers, what position you would need to be in, in a sales process of a company not to be in kind of a blackout period with material non-public information? I mean, if could you have done a tender during this current period? Or do you feel that that would have been giving you of a sale? We've been talking about this in progress. Would that have impeded your ability to do a tender offer?\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nI really have to be careful here, Ron, with what I say about what we could have or should have done and how it relates to what material non-public information we have, because by saying something I sort of can give away the cat. So I have to punt on that.\n\nRonald Mass\n\nAnd can you give us a sense of the company that you're in the sales process of, can you give us any general sense of the type of size of realization whether this would be a relatively small one or a larger one in the context of the market value of the company?\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nLet me answer more generically that the specific reference that we made did have to do with one company. But at any given time, we've got any number of companies that are either quote/unquote in process or having some level of dialogue with potential interested acquirers. This just happened to be a situation that was staring us in the face that circumstances changed a bit. But I'd be remiss, if I tried to put this into a bucket of size. So I can't really answer with any level of certainty or granularity for you there.\n\nRonald Mass\n\nOkay. And also can you comment on when you said, you believe that the current stock price is substantially below your estimate of value, can you shed any additional light on how you look at the value or any type of metrics or numbers or any approximation of what where you see the intrinsic value of the company?\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nWell, we're not at - we're not able to put dollars and cents to that to give you an answer. But what I would tell you that the way we look at value is in a number of different ways. We can look at the current value of each of the enterprises as evidenced by their most recent funding round by applying comparables to their performance metrics and coming up with a specific number. And we also look at our expected exit values for these companies and what the discounted value would be at present of those anticipated exit values. And that's what I meant when I said no matter how we look at it, we believe that there is a significant delta. I think, if you look at the information that was included at the back of the press release, you'll also get some further idea of the things you're asking about.\n\nRonald Mass\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you very much.\n\nMark Herndon\n\nYeah, I'll just add that the back of that press release that referenced the cost that the company has invested in the partner companies is approximately $206 million, and then you add on top of that where we stand today with the cash of the $45 million. So that alone is a substantial value when you look us as the company with 0 debt.\n\nRonald Mass\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. Your line is open.\n\nJames MacDonald\n\nYeah. I thought, I'd just follow-up with a question about the 3 most recent financings. Could you characterize at all the sort of type of financing for Syapse, Aktana and Moxe Health? I mean, are they just support growth or cover losses? What are your thoughts on those?\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nThose are all absolutely growth support transactions, full stop, yeah.\n\nJames MacDonald\n\nOkay. And any update on Prognos? I hear they're progressing well.\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nPrognos is doing very well. Yeah, their commercial traction and their partnership development continues to be very pleasing to us. Sundeep is doing a - has been doing and continues to do a fabulous job there. Yeah, nothing but good things to say about Prognos.\n\nJames MacDonald\n\nOkay. Thanks very much.\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to the presenters.\n\nBrian Sisko\n\nWell, thank you very much. We have a lot of work ahead of us to bring this strategy to conclusion. We'll keep you all apprised of our progress as best we can on an ongoing basis. In the meantime, thank you very much for your continued interest and support, and your confidence in us here at Safeguard.\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."
Cognizant,0,"The commentary (\""Hennepin, Ramsey attorneys have turned on cops,\"" Opinion Exchange, Nov. 7) informed readers of the new normal in the relationship between law enforcement officers and their respective prosecuting attorneys. It is unfortunate this has occurred, but recent high-profile cases have created this unhealthy relationship.\n\nCounty attorneys and their staff, of all people, should be ENTITY of the principle of innocence before guilt. However, social media has fanned the flames of the opposite of this mentality, and it is rampant. Yes, cops make mistakes, and some should not even wear the uniform. That is what psychological screening and field training is supposed to detect. Bodycams and dashcams document as much as possible. Citizen eyewitnesses frequently record at scenes, too. All of this can be beneficial to prove the guilt or innocence of an officer during an incident. (The fever pitch of \""anti-cop\"" has some of its underpinnings with the anti-Trump sentiment, too.)\n\nI always advise those who ask not to enter the law enforcement profession. While the personal sense of accomplishment is potentially great, the extreme fishbowl existence is not worth it. This has already manifested itself in the low recruitment numbers for large departments. Law enforcement officers welcome the high standards they must maintain. But who would pursue a career where you are constantly vilified and thought to be the problem? The healthy economy has opened doors for other considerations. Pursue them and never look back.\n\nThrowing our local cops under the bus doesn't seem to be working out too well, as demonstrated by recent headlines, including a Nov. 7 commentary. The extreme anger expressed by their local unions appears to reflect the adverse feelings among our police force, union leaders, their prosecuting attorneys and local leadership. Those headlines also include \""St. Paul rocked by shootings even as chief seeks calm\"" (Nov. 7), \""Mayor, residents pour out St. Paul's anger, sorrow\"" (Nov. 8) and \""Violent crime up 13% in Minneapolis\"" (Nov. 8). We see protests and public outcries over every now-assumed \""excessive\"" use of force and officer's shooting of offenders.\n\nThere used to be respect for our law enforcement officers in more conservative times, and far more social order. Children now get away with misbehavior in our public schools and carry that lack of discipline into adulthood. It is surprising that anyone would want to aspire to become an officer enforcing laws against a progressive tide that won't support their efforts; why risk your lives in harm's way in an unappreciated career? This all needs to change, or we will soon have no police force, law and order, jails or prisons -- but perhaps that is what is desired by the local majority's progressive trend to socialism.\n\nOn Nov. 4, another \""expert\"" was published in Opinion Exchange who thinks he knows what works best for each of the 50 million people in the U.S. who have chronic pain (\""To end opioid crisis we must understand pain\""). The overdose problem is very real, but punishing people who use opioids for severe pain is not the answer. I have tried medical marijuana, acupuncture, spinal injections, radio-frequency ablation, physical therapy, etc. The only thing that enables me to live a halfway normal life is oxycodone. When trying alternatives, I had no withdrawal problems. (One study found that, after excluding those with prior drug or alcohol abuse, less than 2% of chronic pain patients became addicted.)\n\nThe popular statistic that three out of four people on heroin started with misusing prescription opioids is misleading because it does not differentiate between physician-prescribed and illegally acquired opioids. Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that many overdoses involving illicit drugs have likely been erroneously counted as prescription-drug deaths, because toxicology tests cannot distinguish between pharmaceutical and illicit fentanyl and because multiple drugs may be involved.\n\nThe Federal Drug Administration estimates that complications from over-the-counter and prescription NSAIDs cause over 16,000 deaths a year and 88,000 people die each year from alcohol abuse. Even though the number of opioid prescriptions written fell by almost 30% from 2011 to 2017, the number of overdoses from heroin and synthetic opioids increased by 88% from 2013 to 2016. It's time that the government concentrated on the real causes of abuse!\n\nThe massacre of three women and six children by members of the Mexican drug cartels was certainly horrific (\""First 3 of 9 Mexico massacre victims buried,\"" Nov. 8). Terrible violence arises wherever drugs are in demand. Even in this country, drug gang wars are a cause of homicide. In Latin America, drug gang wars kill and terrorize so many innocent people that citizens are driven to immigrate to America by the tens of thousands. It seems that neither police power, even backed by military force, nor the Mexican president's policy of improving working conditions and incomes has even begun to reduce the shocking deaths of innocent victims.\n\nWe need to make all drugs legal. That drugs are illegal means that the cost for them surges to astronomical levels. The enormous profits from the drug trade is what drives dealers to commit violence. Eliminating the piles of money drug lords amass would obviously eliminate the violence. A hundred years ago, when alcohol was illegalized in America, it led to an increase in organized crime, which Americans eventually no longer tolerated. We made the sale of alcohol legal, retaining only reasonable restrictions on its sale and instituting medical treatment and social programs to mitigate its effects. Overnight, alcohol kingpins disappeared.\n\nWe could effect the same enormously positive results by legalizing all drugs. There would be downsides. Perhaps more people would try heroin and other dangerous drugs. But universal drug legalization would mean that life-threatening drug reactions would be immediately treated and the same social/psychological interventions we use to treat alcoholism could be implemented to combat drug addiction. We could end the poverty caused by drug addiction. Latin Americans would not need to flee to this country, which would nearly eliminate the immigration crisis.\n\nMost significantly, we could halt the raging drug wars that kill so many thousands of people, users and sellers, dealers and innocent children. I am gobsmacked that no one, either in government or the press, even mentions such an obvious solution to this horrible problem.\n\nI love birds, but I have a couple questions about the potential remediation of U.S. Bank Stadium to prevent birds from flying into its glass (\""Stadium is magnet for bird collisions,\"" Nov. 7). First, what percentage of the number of birds that fly over Minneapolis is 111 (the number found dead around the stadium)? Second, what percent is 111 of all the birds that die of other causes (e.g. windmills, power lines, cars and other human creations) on their way south? And third, isn't it likely that a number of birds would still fly into the glass even after the remediation?\n\nRather than throw money into changing the stadium, would it be more effective for the owners to donate a comparable amount to the Audubon Society (or other conservation groups) to support overall efforts to protect wildlife?"
Apple Inc,0,"Every minute, machines are deciding your future. Software programs don't just recommend books and movies you might like: they also determine the interest rate you'll pay on a loan, whether you land a dream job and even the chance you might commit a crime. The hope was that computers trained to find patterns in vast pools of data would make such decisions more objectively than humans do. Instead, researchers are finding that algorithms -- the logic at the heart of software programs -- can replicate and even amplify the prejudices of those who create them. ENTITY and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. got caught in the controversy as a Wall Street regulator opened a probe into whether the algorithm of their joint project ENTITY Card discriminates against women."
Al Houthi,1,"The secretary general of the Lebanese Hezbollah resistance movement says Americans are exploiting the ongoing mass protests in the Arab country to fulfill their own interests and advance their agenda, stressing that Washington has prevented Lebanon from standing on its feet.\n\nAccording to Press TV, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech broadcast live from the Lebanese capital city of Beirut as he addressed his supporters on Monday evening \Americans are taking advantage of the demonstrations for their own interests,\"" adding that the United States ignores social realities in Lebanon, including poverty and unemployment, and only focuses on the continuation of protests.\n\nThe leader of the Lebanese resistance movement further noted that demonstrations in the country have made the Lebanese more united than ever in their fight against corruption, adding, \""The ongoing protests in Lebanon prevent any political faction from protecting those involved in corruption crimes.\""\n\nStressing that there should be no discrimination in the fight against corruption, Nasrallah added that all Lebanese should take part in fight against corruption by cooperating with judiciary.\n\nThe Hezbollah leader emphasized that the campaign against corruption requires impartial and honest judiciary and mechanisms to restore the stolen money, adding, \""Let the court start trying Hezbollah members, and I pledge to lift the impunity of the party's ministers and members of the parliament.\""\n\nHe highlighted that Lebanon's manufacturing sector is terribly suffering from inefficiency and lack of productivity, arguing that the United States is creating obstacles for the direct investment and smooth operation of Chinese firms in Lebanon.\n\nNasrallah went on to say that US threats to impose sanctions and punitive measures on participants in Syria's reconstruction have deterred Lebanese companies from taking part in the process.\n\n\""US sanctions have hampered the growth of Lebanon's economy. The United States has even blocked economic routes between Lebanon and Iraq. It has not allowed the opening of the border crossing - which connects the town of Bukamal in Syria's Northeastern Province of Dayr al-Zawr to the city of Husaybah in the al-Qa'im district of Iraq's Western Province of Anbar - despite repeated appeals by Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi,\"" the Hezbollah chief said.\n\n\""Americans are doing their best in order to exert unrelenting economic pressure on Lebanon,\"" he highlighted.\n\nNasrallah also roundly dismissed latest remarks by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo concerning Iran's influence in Lebanon as \""unfounded and absurd,\"" saying, \""In American officials' eyes, Iran's influence in Lebanon means support for the resistance movement.\""\n\nPompeo wrote on his Twitter page on November 5 that the people of Iraq and Lebanon have a right to free themselves of Iranian influence.\n\nThe Hezbollah secretary general also noted that the possibility of any US war on Iran has reduced by 99.99% and that the Islamic Republic has remained steadfast in the face of US pressures and those of Washington's allies.\n\n\""Iranians have gone through the toughest economic times and remain steadfast against the pressures exerted by the US and its allies,\"" Nasrallah said, adding that the recent discovery of a huge oil field in Southwestern Iranian Province of Khuzestan could be a major boost to the country's economy.\n\n\""(US President Donald) Trump is only after oil and money. He is ready to betray its own allies when his interests are at stake,\"" Nasrallah said, asserting that the recent discovery of oil in Iran will make Trump very sad.\n\nNasrallah said contacts and consultations are underway among various Lebanese political parties in order to form a new government in the country.\n\n\""People from different strata of the Lebanese society should overcome their bitter divisions, and focus on national consensus instead.\n\n\""Fighting corruption is the main achievement of the latest developments in Lebanon... Corrupt officials should be punished duly. All Lebanese people should contribute to the fight against corruption through full cooperation with the judiciary,\"" Nasrallah said.\n\nElsewhere in his remarks, the Hezbollah chief hailed the recent comments by the leader of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement, Abdul-Malik ENTITY, that the Yemeni people will not hesitate to deal a stinging blow to Israel in case the Tel Aviv regime commits the folly of attacking Yemen.\n\n\""Although Yemen has been under the Saudi-led aggression for five years, ENTITY threatened the Israeli enemy of responding to any attack.\""\n\n\""Yemeni forces have built up a great military power and this further strengthens the axis of resistance in the entire (West Asia) region. Even though Yemen has been devastated by the Saudi-led aggression for more than five years, the Yemeni nation has proved that they will not give in to pressures,\"" Nasrallah said.\n\nNasrallah then hailed the Yemeni crowds who attended Ansarullah movement's celebration marking the Prophet Muhammad's birthday despite the ongoing Saudi war on their country, saying, Yemeni crowds' attendance sent a very clear message to the enemies that despite the ongoing war, they will continue to confront it steadfastly."
Jamaat-ud-Dawah,1,"Watchmen, Damon Lindelof's TV adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' graphic novel, has no shortage of real-world references. Taking place over 30 years after the events of the graphic novel, the HBO series continues to expand the alternate timeline that parallels America's ongoing 200-year-plus history. While Moore and Gibbons tackled the Cold War with Russia, the Richard Nixon presidency and Vietnam War, Lindelof takes on the racial divide in the United States and recent controversies surrounding law enforcement. Like what unfolded on the page, the series blurs the lines between fiction and reality with explorations, forgotten history and nods to current events and pop culture that appear or unfold differently in Watchmen's universe.\n\nHere's an ongoing list -- updated with each new episode -- of all the historical events, political figures and pop culture references featured in the series. Warning: some spoilers below.\n\nAmerican Crime Story [first referenced in season 1, episode 1]: Executive produced by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, ACS is a companion FX anthology series to American Horror Story, chronicling various true events that shaped the American landscape -- often with a lens of hindsight -- from the trial of O.J. Simpson to the assassination of Gianni Versace.\n\nIn the series, a version of ACS exists as American Hero Story. It's essentially a show-within-a-show reenacting some of the events of Moore and Gibbons' graphic novel, which told the backstory of the Minutemen, a group of superheroes from the 1940s. More specifically, AHS focuses on the mysterious Hooded Justice, whose identity was never revealed. Each episode continues the narrative through snippets watched by the show's main characters.\n\nAccording to Paste, which features a detailed account about the purpose of AHS within the series, \Lindelof didn't tell Murphy about the reference in advance, calling it 'an elbow to the ribs' rather than a full parody of those shows. This is because not only does Lindelof 'love [Murphy] as a person, and I think as a TV writer, and producer, he's amazing,' but American Hero Story is quite deliberately inspired by American Crime Story, but meant to be cheesier.\""\n\nBass Reeves [first referenced in season 1, episode 1]: Born into slavery, Reeves eventually became the first black deputy US Marshal to serve west of the Mississippi River a decade after the ratification of the 13th Amendment. Assigned to a district of Arkansas, he also covered the Indian Territory. According to the Norman Transcript, he was revered for bringing in some of the most dangerous criminals, being a marksman and having superior detective skills, and making over 3,000 arrests.\n\nOn the show, a hooded Reeves (portrayed by Jamal Akakpo) appears in the opening scene of Trust in the Law!, a film playing to a nearly empty Tulsa theater as the Race Riot of 1921 unfolds outside. The scene depicts Reeves chasing down a white man, whom he ultimately arrests after it's revealed that he is a \""scoundrel\"" while Reeves is a member of the law -- and the real hero of the story.\n\nAccording to a file on Peteypedia -- an HBO website containing the personal files of agent Dale Petey (played by Dustin Ingram) -- \""[t]he symbolism suggests a story about good and evil we've seen countless times, a narrative that was already a cliché to the film's first audience in the early days of nickelodeons and movie palaces. The white hat is our hero, the black hat is our villain. Quickly, though, expectations are subverted. The man in white is a corrupt sheriff, and the hooded figure lassoing him off his high horse is someone even more surprising, a black man with a badge.\"" The symbolism is a theme that is carried throughout the premiere, especially when it comes to Regina King's character, Det. Angela Abar aka Sister Night.\n\nDevo [first ref. in season 1, episode 3]: Similarly to the premiere, the title of episode three is a song lyric. This time, \""She Was Killed by Space Junk,\"" is from the 1978 Devo song, \""Space Junk.\"" Devo is significant here, because it's a band that appears in Silk Spectre II's record collection in the graphic novel and comes up one night when she's hanging out with the Nite Owl.\n\nOn the show, Laurie Blake (an older version of Silk Spectre played by Jean Smart) asks her home assistant to play one of their albums, presumably Q. Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!, which features \""Space Junk.\"" The lyric specifically comes back into play by the end of the episode, when Laurie finishes telling her version of a \""brick joke\"" and is nearly crushed by Angela Abar's car, which drops from the sky just outside the phone booth she was in.\n\nHenry Louis Gates Jr. [first referenced in season 1, episode 2]: A longtime literary critic, teacher and historian, Gates is the most prominent voices on race. He currently serves as the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard University and has authored The Signifying Monkey. Gates also hosts the PBS docuseries Finding Your Roots, which explores the genealogy and ancestry of its celebrity guests.\n\nIn the second episode of Watchmen, Gates makes a cameo as the Treasury Secretary under President Redford. Appearing in hologram form at a kiosk in the Greenwood Center for Cultural Heritage, he guides Angela through the process of getting her DNA processed to find out if she is related to the victims of the Tulsa Massacre and eligible for reparations.\n\nJohn Grisham [first ref. in season 1, episode 3]: This is more of an Easter egg than a significant reference, but the author known for his many legal thrillers -- A Time to Kill, The Client, The Pelican Brief -- appears in a newspaper headline that reads, \""GRISHAM TO RETIRE FROM THE SUPREME COURT.\""\n\nSimilarly to Henry Louis Gates Jr. appearing as Treasury Secretary and Robert Redford as president, Grisham seems to have been appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in this alternate timeline. But it's also worth noting that before Grisham became famous for his novels, he practiced law for a decade and even was a Member of the Mississippi House of Representatives from the 7th district from 1984 to 1990.\n\nNazi Propaganda [first referenced in season 1, episode 2]: Opening with another flashback, audiences see Nazis dropping leaflets over a troop of African-American soldiers suggesting that they've done nothing wrong to black people in Germany. \""Have they ever done you any harm?\"" the sheet reads before listing out various lies. The leaflet, we learn, is the same one that was pinned to a young boy during the Tulsa Massacre in the premiere and is the paper that falls from the sky after Will is whisked away from Angela by a mysterious plane.\n\nJust like the Tulsa Massacre, the flashback is something that happened but is rarely discussed in detail. While racist themselves, that didn't stop the Nazis from trying to exploit racial tensions among U.S. forces during World War II. \""Creating wedges between people had been a Nazi strategy since the party's inception,\"" writes Steven Luckert, senior program curator at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. \""The Nazis exploited people of African descent in their propaganda for political and military purposes. They were bogeymen, used as props to garner votes and later to incite Germans in 'defense' of racial purity and their homeland.\""\n\nLuckert continues by writing, \""It is difficult to know what impact, if any, these fliers had on African-American soldiers, especially in late 1944, when Germany was nearing defeat.\"" And according to the show, it had little effect on at least one soldier, though it did nothing to hide America's own racial divide.\n\nRobert Redford [first referenced in season 1, episode 1]: A longtime screen actor, Redford has earned two Academy Awards and starred in films such as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and All the President's Men. In addition to acting, he's also set himself apart as a successful director and founder of the Sundance Film Festival. Honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Redford is also known as the Godfather of Indie Film and a longtime supporter of the environment, LGBTQ rights and the arts.\n\nOn the show, Redford is the current president of the United States, having taken office after defeating Richard Nixon. While never appearing in person, his likeness and presidency is inescapable, from posters of Redford in the classroom to remarks about his left-leaning policies, which include strict gun control and reparations (regarded negatively as \""Redfordations\"") for African-American citizens, and the emergence of Nixonvilles -- trailer parks populated by poor white people -- following Nixon's departure from the White House. He's even referred to as \""Sundancer in Chief\"" at one point. Redford also maintains Nixon's abolishment of term limits.\n\nIn another file found on Peteypedia, more details about Redford's connection to the Watchmen have emerged, including the fact that Adrian Veidt \""was the biggest contributor to the Democratic Party during the late 80s and early 90s, leading the way in financing the 'blue wave' that ended 24 consecutive years of conservative rule in 1992.\""\n\nRodgers & Hammerstein's Oklahoma! [first referenced in season 1, episode 1]: Debuting on Broadway in 1943, Oklahoma! is a hit musical about a farm girl who is wooed by two opposing suitors, the earnest cowboy Curly and the sinister farmhand ENTITY. Widely received as \""a beautiful and delightful show\"" at the time, a celebrated and Tony Award-winning 2019 Broadway revival stripped the production of its showy style to reveal a dark story about love lost and the bleak life of the frontier. This version \""elicit[s] the shadows from within the play's sunshine.\""\n\nSoon after the premiere jumps back to present day -- which is September 2019 -- Chief ENTITYd Crawford (Don Johnson) is watching a local production of the musical. The title song is being performed onstage by a cast of African-American actors as viewers meet the head of the Tulsa, Oklahoma, police, whose character parallels the two suitors. First he is introduced as \""a cowboy through and through\"" who later performs a rendition of \""People Will Say We're in Love\"" during a dinner party with his family. Yet, he later ends up dead -- just like the show's antagonist with whom he shares the same name -- as the song, \""Pore ENTITY is Daid,\"" plays at the end of the episode. (For even more on the importance of the musical in the first episode, listen to \""Breaking Down the Season Premiere of Watchmen\"" by The Watch podcast.)\n\n\""We are delighted by Damon Lindelof's thoughtful and clever integration of the music, themes and stories that Rodgers & Hammerstein put to paper decades ago,\"" a representative at the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization told ET in a statement. \""When the production came to us with this request, we were happy to approve the idea of these characters and music and lyrics being incorporated with the narrative of this well-respected franchise. Bringing new meaning to 'it's summer and we're running out of ice,' actors portraying ENTITY in productions all over the world will be thinking of Watchmen.\""\n\nSeventh Cavalry and Little Bighorn [first referenced in season 1, episode 1]: Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer, the armored cavalry is most famous for its participation in the American Indian Wars, including Battle of Little Bighorn. Also known as Custer's Last Stand, the battle devastated the cavalry, which resulted in Custer's death and the annihilation of five of the 7th Cavalry's 12 companies.\n\nInterestingly, the 7th Cavalry was nicknamed the \""Garryowen,\"" an Irish tune dating back to the 1600s referring to the \""Garden of Owen.\"" According to the 1st Cavalry Division Association, \""Owen's garden was soon to become as famous for scenes of strife as it was for mirth and humor; and broken arms, legs and heads became a staple article of manufacture in the neighborhood... [The young men] sometimes suffered their genius to soar as high as the breaking of a street lamp, and even resorting to the physical violence of a watchman.\""\n\nOn the show, the \""Seventh Kavalry\"" refers to the group of extremists and vigilantes -- not very dissimilar to the Ku Klux Klan -- which has re-emerged years after the White Night assault on the police with a new goal of domestic terrorism. They, too, wear masks -- homemade versions of the one Rorschach wore in the original graphic novel. After one of the members attacks a police officer during a routine traffic stop, the Tulsa detectives are alerted by pager with the code words, \""Little Bighorn.\""\n\nTulsa Race Riot of 1921 (or Black Wall Street Massacre) [first referenced in season 1, episode 1]: Largely ignored in American history classes, the events of 1921 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, \""was one of the worst outbreaks of racial violence in American history: a horrific spree of murder, arson and looting inflicted by white residents upon the prosperous African-American community of Greenwood, followed by a shameless cover-up.\"" The New York Timesput together an extensive syllabus featuring \""a collection of eyewitness accounts, official reports and subsequent reporting and commentary on the destruction of the thriving district once known as 'Black Wall Street.'\""\n\nOpening with a scene of Trust in the Law!, the premiere eventually reveals that the film is playing in a near-empty theater as the massacre unfolds on the streets. Soon, an African-American boy and his mother run outside to witness the violence and destruction firsthand as they try to navigate their way to safety. While his parents are unable to save themselves, the boy is rescued by being hidden in a crate on an automobile that manages to get out of town.\n\nAccording to Vulture, which goes deep inside the recreation of the horrifying event, \""[T]his scene is key to establishing the reality of Watchmen's Tulsa setting, where, in the present day, there is a reparations program for descendants of the murdered and displaced victims of the massacre. Championed by President Robert Redford, the so-called 'Redfordations' incur backlash from a Rorschach-inspired racist militia called the Seventh Kavalry; one of Watchmen's central mysteries arises from an investigation into Kavalry sympathies within the police force. But where Watchmen's present day eschews neat one-to-one analogies with the real world, its Tulsa sequence is intended as a direct reflection of American history.\"" It effectively outlines the basis for the series, which will continue to reveal connections between 1921 and 2019 throughout the season.\n\nWatchmen airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nRegina King on Stepping Into the 'Badass' Shoes of Sister Night on HBO's 'Watchmen' (Exclusive)\n\n'Lost' Creator Damon Lindelof Addresses Those Reboot Rumors!

Jamaat-ud-Dawah,1,"Long before HBO's Watchmen television series officially begun, fans knew there would be too many sly references to the graphic novel and feature film to count. Now that the first episodes have aired, it can be confirmed: Easter Egg hunters will have their hands full with Watchmen.\n\nWhile the TV show is better described as a Watchmen 'remix' than direct sequel, that still provides opportunities in every scene to give fans a nod, especially to the original Watchmen graphic novel written by Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons. From Dr. Manhattan's origin story to President Robert Redford, here are all the Watchmen Easter Eggs that we've spotted so far.\n\nContinue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view. Start now advertising 20. Smiley Faces Everywhere\n\nRight off the bat, expect to see faces (of both the smiley and clock variety) all throughout the series. Even if you only have a passing awareness of the Watchmen comic, you've probably seen the yellow smiley face badge worn by the vigilante known as The Comedian, and the blood smear across it. It's a recurring thematic element across the whole story, and are joined by clock faces, communicating the 'Doomsday C'lock that's ever ticking closer to humanity's doom. In the first episode, Angela creates a smiley face formed by some eggs in a bowl (a literal Easter Egg of sorts). The camera angles also deliver re-imagined faces in subtler ways, most notably the overhead shot of a dining room fixture looking like hands on a clock.\n\nadvertising 19. Dr. Manhattan's Work on Mars\n\nLater on in the first episode, we see a quick clip of Dr. Manhattan himself on Mars, where he now lives after the original Watchmen storyline. He looks to be creating a massive castle or mansion out of the Martian sand, before dissolving it away. Dr. Manhattan, the most powerful being in the Watchmen universe, hasn't been seen on Earth since those original events. The clip looks like surveillance of his actions on the planet, but should viewers take this as the same construction seen in the original comic? And does Manhattan have plans to return to Earth in the series?\n\nadvertising 18. President Robert Redford\n\nWhat was mentioned as a possibility in the Watchmen graphic novel has become a reality in the series. Yes, President Robert Redford assumes the leadership of the United States after Nixon--for seven consecutive terms. Where Nixon was the perfect leader for the nuclear crisis and growing conservative leanings of the original series, it seems Redford was chosen soon after for his liberal policies, and eventual decision to provide damages to the descendants of those who suffered racial injustice. Among racists, it's known as \""Redfordations.\"" It's unknown at this point whether or not Robert Redford will actually appear as a presidential version of himself later on in the series.\n\nadvertising 17. The \""Unforgettable\"" Song Choice\n\nWhile the soundtrack is often filled with modern music choices, the song \""Unforgettable\"" can be heard playing while Police Chief ENTITYd Crawford and Detective Angela Abar (aka Sister Night) enjoy dinner together with their families. The song is used to advertise Veidt's Nostalgia perfume in the original comic book, but will also be recognized for its use in Zack Snyder's Watchmen film adaptation from 2009 as well. It's simple, but a really nice callback to the first story.\n\n16. The Seventh Kavalry Will Answer 'No'\n\nIn a somewhat disturbing reference to the vigilante Rorschach from the original Watchmen, there is the Seventh Kavalry, a white supremacist group who have modeled their look after Rorschach himself, wearing identical masks (which he once wore before being killed by Dr. Manhattan). When these terrorists send a message to the police, they riff a version of Rorschach's own words from his journal: \""Soon all the whores and race traitors will shout 'save us.' And we will whisper, 'No.'\"" The Seventh Kavalry seems to have adopted and edited the words of Rorschach's journal, which tells us that his journal was indeed published, which was in doubt at the end of the first story. However, it looks like it's been accepted only by those who hate \""the system\"" and conspiracy theorists. Those who would take the darkest parts of the journal and twist them as tools to propel their own misguided agendas (like a manifesto for a white supremacist group).\n\nadvertising 15. Nite Owl Mug\n\nWhen Sister Night and Crawford meet to discuss the latest attack by the Seventh Kavalry, it's easy to spot her drinking from a Nite Owl coffee mug. It's a pretty fun nod to the character, who was a large part of the first story. Not to mention another person who uncovered the details behind Veidt's dark plot to end the Cold War by killing millions. It's unclear as to where where Nite Owl ended up by this point, though he agreed alongside Dr. Manhattan and Spectre to keep Veidt's plot a secret, to keep the peace. He could potentially appear down the line.\n\nadvertising 14. Nite Owl's Ship, Repurposed\n\nWhen Detectives Sister Night, Looking Glass, and Red Scare go after 7K, they are provided with air support from Chief Crawford himself, who reveals himself to be monitoring their attack from above, in an aircraft that shares the same designs and technology as Nite Owl's own ship, lovingly named Archimedes. The obvious question, then, is how did law enforcement get a hold of Nite Owl's tech? Did he make a deal with them to share his tech in order to stay out of prison? Hopefully it's a question that will be answered as the series continues (since it's something fans will obviously notice).\n\n13. American Hero Story: Minutemen\n\nA fairly explicit reference to the real American Horror Story television series, the Watchmen universe looks to have their own version in American Hero Story: The Minutemen. Quite a few advertisements for the show appear through the early episodes, and even a short trailer featuring images of Hooded Justice, The Comedian, and Silk Spectre; all heroes who were part of the original Minutemen crime fighting team decades prior in the Watchmen universe.\n\nadvertising 12. The Blood Smear\n\nNear the end of the first episode, Chief Crawford is found dead, hanged from a tree. His police badge is eventually shown lying in the grass beneath his body, focused on just as a drop of blood falls onto the upper left corner. It's a callback to the blood smear found on The Comedian's badge in the first story, becoming the iconic image of the entire Watchmen story (and audiences are sure to see a LOT more blood smear imagery throughout the series as episodes go on).\n\n11. Oklahoma \""ENTITY is Dead\"" Song in End Credits\n\nSince the first episode concludes with the death of ENTITYd Crawford, it's fitting that the end scene and credits should feature \""Pore ENTITY is Daid,\"" a song from the musical Oklahoma. It's actually double the references, calling back to Crawford's first appearance in the series with his wife at a performance of Oklahoma, and a meta Easter Egg due to the fact that Crawford's first name is ENTITYd, and well...\""ENTITY is Daid\"" by episode's end.\n\nadvertising\n\n10. Two Minutes to Midnight\n\nMoving on to the second episode, \""Martial Feats of Comanche Horsemanship\"", the first Easter Egg comes from a flashback to the \""White Night\"" event. Just before Angela and her husband Cal are attacked, Cal mentions that they have only two minutes to wait until midnight, and Christmas Day. That's another reference to the Doomsday Clock, the time of which is actually 2 minutes to midnight in real life. It's a continuation of the clock motif, as well as a foreboding warning that the world nears ever closer to man-made destruction--the very thing Veidt supposedly prevents by stopping the Cold War. However, is it possible that he just prevented the inevitable? Time will tell.\n\nadvertising 9. Knot-Top Gang Graffiti\n\nAs Angela drives to meet with Looking Glass and Red Scare, she leaves her bakery. As she leaves, we see graffiti on an alley wall. It's actually the same graffiti from the comic sprayed by the Knot-Top Gang. It features two lovers in an embrace, attempting to reference the burned shadows left behind in Hiroshima, as a result of the atomic bomb. It makes sense, as the threat of nuclear war was a huge concern in the original comic. It would be logical that those fears would remain in forms like this.\n\n8. New Frontiersman and Nova Express\n\nA newspaper vendor is selling two papers: the New Frontiersman and Nova Express, right and left-wing papers sold in the Watchmen universe. It's actually the New Frontiersman that receives Rorschach's journal with the details of Veidt's plot and publishes them in the final pages of the graphic novel. However, said paper doesn't have all that much credibility... meaning that Rorschach's uncovered conspiracy isn't generally believed by the mass public. But at least they're still publishing decades later.\n\nadvertising 7. Senator Joe Keene\n\nThe same newspaper vendor gives his opinion on Senator Joe Keene looking to make a run for the presidency. The name Keene should be familiar to Watchmen fans, as Joe Keene's father was the one responsible for The Keene Act. The act made vigilantism illegal after the police strikes that occurred in response to the often hindering, and sometimes threatening actions of various vigilantes. It seems as though the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, and his son went into politics as well.\n\n6. Pirate and Owl Costumes\n\nWhen Angela returns home from the crime scene and Red Scare's raid on Nixonville, Cal and their adopted children are playing. While it might seem like random costumes, it's important to spot that one daughters is dressed as a pirate, and the other as an owl. These appear to be slight nods to Nite Owl, as well as \""Tales of the Black Freighter,\"" a pirate comic book in the universe of the original story, interwoven with the main plot (pirate comics take the place of the superhero comic genre, as superheroes are real in this world).\n\n5. Topher's Metal Castle\n\nAngela then heads upstairs to break the news of Crawford's death to her adopted son, Topher. While she talks to him, he's building a floating metal house constructed out of magnetic metal blocks. Strangely enough, it looks an awful lot like the building of sand Dr. Manhattan was making in that clip in the first episode. Furthermore, upon hearing from Angela that ENTITYd has died, he knocks the metal castle down, just like how Manhattan dissolved his own castle. There must be a connection with this same house being built and then destroyed.\n\n4. More Clocks\n\nEven more clocks are seen in this episode, including one likely to be missed in Topher's room. In the background, one of Salvador Dali's most famous paintings can be seen above the dresser: The Persistence of Memory (the painting that features the melting clocks). Add it all to the other appearances of Adrian Veidt's pocketwatch, and a yellow egg timer at the episode's end, and it looks like the clock may be one of the most often-appearing forms of Easter Eggs for viewers to watch out for.\n\n3. American Hero Story: Hooded Justice\n\nThe show finally reveals a portion of an episode of American Hero Story: Hooded Justice, the Watchmen universe's first costumed superhero. He stops some men trying to rob a general store, and perfectly demonstrates why vigilantes eventually became an enemy of the police. As he's brutally beating them into submission, there are several shots in slow motion and sped up for effect, almost certainly intended as a reference to the other live-action adaptation of Watchmen, directed by Zack Snyder.\n\n2. Angela's Goggles, More Owl Tech?\n\nWhen Angela sneaks into ENTITYd's closest to see if he is keeping any secrets there (metaphorically or literally), she uses specialized, high-tech goggles to effectively x-ray the compartments. And they sure do look like the goggles used by Nite Owl in the Watchmen movie. Again, it will be interesting to see if this is tech Nite Owl created for law enforcement, or potentially tech that law enforcement appropriated for some reason.\n\n1. Veidt's Play, The Watchmaker's Son\n\nLastly, but certainly not least, we come to Veidt's castle and servants. It's the payoff of his previously mentioned play, entitled \""The Watchmaker's Son.\"" The reference may be lost on casual fans, but the fact that Jon Osterman was raised by a watchmaker before becoming a scientist is key to his character. After celebrating an anniversary with his second cake, decorating with two candles, Veidt watches as his servants perform the origin story of Dr. Manhattan (who apparently now knows as much about Jon's upbringing as readers of the graphic novel).his play about Dr. Manhattan's origins. Is this a sign Veidt's become obsessed with the superhuman? We'll just have to wait and see.\n\nExpect to see plenty more Watchmen Easter egg breakdowns with each new episode! And if there are any we've missed, be sure to let us know in the comments.\n\nMORE: HBO's Watchmen Cast & Character Guide\n\nHome SR Originals Every WATCHMEN Easter Egg in The HBO Series So Far\n\nTags: watchmen\n\nShare Tweet Comment Email Copy Link Copied advertising"
Jamaat-ud-Dawah,1,"A few days ago, it came to light that global terror financing watchdog, FATF warned the Islamic Republic of Pakistan of blacklisting if it did not promptly complete the full action plan that was given to it in order to check terror financing by February 20. China which is considered Pakistan's all-weather ally has come out in its support. China has stated that the aim of FATF is not to sanction or punish any country and that it will work with all global parties of the FATF to bolster the domestic anti-terror financing system of Pakistan.\n\nThis comes after senior Chinese officials made it clear that the dragon is opposed to the blacklisting of Pakistan by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). China also sought to play down the Deputy Director General for Policy Planning of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affair, Yao Wen's remarks to the Pakistani press that Beijing has a trust deficit with India, when compared to its close relations with Pakistan. Yao Wen also tried to accuse India of politicising the Paris-based global terror financing watchdog, without making a direct reference. He said that China does not want the FATF of being politicised by any \""single country\"". He said, \""There are some countries, which want to include Pakistan in the blacklist. We consider they have political designs. That is something China is against. China stands for justice.\"" It does not take much intellect to understand which country the Chinese official referred to when he said \""some countries\"" are trying to get Pakistan blacklisted.\n\nChina has come out in support of Pakistan at a time when countries across the globe have come to see it as the most prominent manufacturer and exporter of terror. This raises apprehensions that China might obstruct attempts to blacklist Pakistan at the Paris-based body, just like it had blocked attempts to designate Jaish-e-Mohammed chief, Maulana Masood Azhar as a global terrorist. China finally relented this year following the outrage after the Pakistan-sponsored terror outfit carried out the Pulwama terror attack and the US threatened to take the issue of Azhar's blacklisting to the UNSC. China has major economic interests and investments in Pakistan. If China takes a stance against the influential Islamic extremists and terror outfits in Pakistan, Chinese investments 46 billion dollars under the CPEC project could come under an imminent threat. Therefore, China not only refuses to take a strong stand against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, but it has also made it a point to tactically support Pakistan against any stern action at multilateral forums.\n\nAfter Pakistan's Interior Minister, Ijaz Ahmed Shah made shocking remarks spending billions of rupees on terror organisation, ENTITY chief Hafeez Saeed, there is not much left to be discussed about Pakistan's role in nurturing the terror industry. Pakistan's Interior Minister had explicitly stated, \""We have spent millions of rupees on ENTITY. We need to demotivate the members of the proscribed organisation and bring them down to the mainstream.\"" Pakistan has been actively raising the terror industry and has also misused, to fund terror, the massive amount it received in form by the US for decades. Pakistan does not even hide its nefarious designs.\n\nBy suggesting that the FATF should refrain from blacklisting Pakistan, Beijing has actually attempted to whitewash the proactive role played by Pakistan in funding terror. Moreover, the argument that the FATF's object is not to punish or sanction any country is altogether absurd. This renders the terror financing watchdog futile, if it cannot punish or sanction a country, then why will any country, and particularly a country like Pakistan listen to it. It is clear that China is trying to find excuses in order to support Pakistan against stern action by the Paris-based FATF.\n\nThe Chinese must be seen in the light of its investments and interests in Pakistan. China has invested extensively in Pakistan and fears that the terror establishment which continues to enjoy enormous influence in Pakistan could harm it in a big way, if the dragon takes a stern stand against Pakistan's terror exporting industry. China's attempts to protect Pakistan from blacklisting are not based on any justifiable principles, rather they is a manifestation of Chinese attempts to safeguard its own economic interests in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan."
Jamaat-ud-Dawah,1,"ISLAMABAD - With killing of Islamic State (IS) chief Abubakr al-Baghdadi, the demoralised terror group can step up its activities through its local chapters and affiliated militant groups in Pakistan and Afghanistan to prove its strength and presence, say security experts.\n\nThe experts view that though the main leadership of IS (ISIS) is not directly involved in the operations of its local chapters and affiliated groups, yet the terror outfit can ask them to carry out some major activities to give a boost to it which is now in disarray and to prevent division within the group. But all this is connected to only one answer that who will be the successor of Baghdadi, they say.\n\nUS President Donald Trump announced on last Sunday that the IS leader died in a raid by US special forces in northwest Syria. In a televised address, he said that Baghdadi killed himself during a raid by blowing up a suicide vest after fleeing into a dead-end tunnel.\n\nTariq Pervez, a counter terrorism expert and former founding head of the National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), told The Nation that IS, also known with its Arab acronym Daesh, was 'demoralized' with killing of one of its founding members. He said IS had a decentralised system and Baghdadi was not directly involved in operations of its local chapters. \""However, the new leadership can ask the local chapters and affiliated groups to step up terrorist activities to prove its strength,\"" he said.\n\nMuhammad Amir Rana, a security expert and director at an Islamabad-based think tank, agrees with Pervez that local groups of IS were dispirited and could become active to face the situation. At the same time, he added that there were chances of split within the IS or its fighters could turn towards other militant organization like Al-Qaeda and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) with the killing of its leader.\n\n\""The situation is similar that Al-Qaeda was facing after killing of Osama bin Laden in a US Navy Seals operation in May 2011,\"" he said adding that there were chances that new split groups could emerge out of IS. For militants, the local groups have more appeal than Daesh, he said.\n\nTo a question about what would be the impact of this killing on local groups when they are connected with an ideology, Rana said that militants of IS used to re-claim ideology of Al-Qaeda or other groups when they get back to these outfits. The major difference of ideology between Al-Qaeda and Daesh is that the former is affiliated with many militant organizations and does not want to establish its caliphate directly. \""On the other hand, IS had been saying that it would directly establish its own caliphate or rule.\""\n\nRana said that IS, in 2018, was found directly involved in five major terrorist attacks including attack on an election rally in Pakistan. This year, IS claimed only one minor terror attack, he added.\n\n\""It all depends that who will be successor of Baghdadi as personalities always matter in militant outfits,\"" said Pervez, also former head of Crime Investigation Department (CIA) Punjab and ex-director general of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).\n\nHe said that the profile of Al-Qaeda was different before and after the killing of Laden as he was very strong, and had strong interactions with the people till he remained the active head of his organization.\n\nAl-Qaeda became weak under the leadership of his successor Ayman al-Zawahiri.\n\nHe said that IS had an alliance with local groups including Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, TTP and some dissidents of ENTITY or Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in Pakistan notwithstanding it announced its new Pakistan chapter in May this year.\n\n\""This alliance would not affect,\"" he said and stressed that the IS group could make fresh efforts to step up its activities.\n\nAbout ideology, the former NACTA chief said that as long as the group had strong ideology, it would continue to attract new recruits and the group would remain alive. He said funding to the group might affect with Baghdadi's death as some of his followers might not provide same help to incoming IS chief."
Jamaat-ud-Dawah,1,"Terrorists have families too, and those families must be 'supported'. Possibly with the help of the State, despite the international pressure and despite the repeated promises to severe all the links with terrorist groups.\n\nSo, in August, while claiming to have arrested chiefs and members of different terrorist groups and freezing their financial assets, the Pakistani government appealed to the United Nations, asking the international organisation to allow a monthly 'pension' to Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, because the founder of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and ENTITY needs to 'support' his family.\n\nAlso Read: Latest News: Four Associates of Hafiz Saeed Arrested in Pakistan\n\nWhy is Mohammed Hafiz Saeed Still Openly Giving Friday Sermons?\n\nThe same request -- and this did not make headlines -- had been made for Yahya Mujahid (Spokesperson ENTITY), Zafar Iqbal (Head of Education Wing), Haji Ashraf (Finance Wing) and Muhammad Bhutvi (Finance Wing). Pakistan had claimed to have arrested the above four men, and to have arrested Hafiz Mohammad Saeed as well, and that their bank accounts were frozen. Immediately after, the government asked one lakh Pakistani rupees allowance for each of them to 'support' their families -- and placed them not in jail but in comfortable rooms at Markaz Al Qadsia in Lahore, where they are free to go on with their activities.\n\nAnd while FATF in Paris was playing with all the fifty shades of grey to keep Pakistan out of the blacklist, the so-called 'banned' organisations and the 'convicted' terrorists were busy -- very busy -- freely carrying out their activities as usual.\n\nHafiz Mohammad Saeed has been openly giving Friday sermons at Markaz Al Qadsia and meeting ENTITY high ranks at his residence in Johar Town, Lahore. Where I remember ISI people guarding and protecting his house and his family, and personal guards armed with guns inside the house. Nothing has changed since then, it seems.\n\nAlso Read: Pak Failing to Curb Money Flow to Hafiz Saeed: Damning FATF Report\n\nTo Avoid FATF Scrutiny, ENTITY is 'Selling Tea'\n\nThe man placed on all the international terror lists is free as usual to meet his people and go on with his terror activities. He visited Sialkot in the past weeks to attend a ENTITY meeting, despite being 'arrested'. According to locals, even Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki, deputy Amir of LeT/ENTITY, made a public appearance a few days ago, for the first time after five months, and delivered a speech at Markaz Al Qadsia.\n\nThis place -- from where I've seen huge cars with darkened windows belonging to preeminent politicians going in and out -- is a so-called 'madrasa complex' in the middle of Lahore.\n\nInterestingly enough, last year, the Government of Punjab claimed it had taken over the ENTITY's famous Muridke Markaz and Lahore's headquarters of Masjid Al Qadsia in Chauburji -- but none of the organisations ever left the place or stopped giving sermons there. Nor were they stopped from collecting money to finance their activities. Locals say that, after the banning of the ENTITY and its charity wing Falah-e-Insaniyat (FIF) by the Pakistan government in March 2019, the ENTITY has been collecting funds by directly approaching wealthy donors.\n\nIn order to avoid FATF scrutiny, the ENTITY has also resorted to door-to door sale of tea (Black Gold Chai). While selling the tea, the buyers are encouraged to pay more for the 'cause of Kashmir'. And Kashmir has been the main focus of the activities of these 'banned' groups over the past two months.\n\nAlso Read: UN Approves Pak Request to Release Hafiz Saeed's Funds for Family\n\n'Charity' for Kashmir\n\nAt least two public meetings have been held in less than a month regarding Kashmir -- the first was to discuss the formation and functioning of local 'Kashmir Committees'. Following the instructions given by Hafiz Masood, brother of Hafiz Mohammad Saeed in a sermon calling for the unity of all Jamaat for the Kashmir cause, the local committees have been instructed to organise protests and street rallies every Friday.\n\nAnd, of course, to collect money. Fund-raising has been organised in Gujranwala, events attended by prominent businessmen of the area, who are then urged to donate in support of the ENTITY's efforts in Kashmir, and to show solidarity for the Kashmiri people. And if somebody thinks all these meetings are for charity and social work, they should think again and stop being delusional.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoney Collected Is Not for Families, But For Kashmir 'Solution' -- 'Jihad, Jihad, Jihad'\n\nThe money collected by all these organisations, all of them on international terror lists, are not to support people, but to execute the only 'solution' that, according to Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, they have for Kashmir: \""Jihad, Jihad, Jihad\"". He has been saying it openly at public rallies and in Friday sermons, in recorded interviews and in TV shows. LeT has been getting people from across the border, training jihadis and managing lethal terror operations all over India. They have a global jihad agenda shared with the so-called 'Deep State' and they will not stop, despite any claims, their terror activities. With the blessings of the State, the 'official' one.\n\nIn fact, in September, Imran Khan awarded the 'Ideal Student Award' to a student of Jamia Al Dirasat Al Islamia, Karachi.\n\nHis 'ideal student' comes from an institute which is a front for ENTITY and is deeply involved in radicalisation and recruitment for the group. The world should stop playing with the Pantone palette of grey shades and acknowledge reality: there's only one colour for Hafiz Mohammad Saeed and his people, and that color is midnight black.\n\n(Francesca Marino is a journalist and a South Asia expert who has written 'Apocalypse Pakistan' with B Natale.

Jamaat-ud-Dawah,1,"Thor Kunkel, German writer and PR expert, elaborates in an interview with FreeWestMedia on the \""division of society\"" in Europe and especially in Germany.\n\nMr. Kunkel, currently one of the main topics in all the media is the so-called \""split society\"" in the whole of Europe, but especially in Germany. As a PR expert, can you explain to us what this actually means?\n\nKunkel: There are once again today two camps that have completely different ideas of a Germany of the 21st century. One group fanatically supports the course of the Merkel government and its crazy migration policy, while the other group is ever more vigorously defending the sovereignty and cultural identity of Germany. Incidentally, this longing for a home is granted to foreigners. Just think of the inclination of many Syrian refugees preferring to spend their holidays in their homeland to \""recover from Germany\"" as a refugee blogger recently wrote. To which one would like to say: Please allow Germans the same privilege.\n\nIn what way?\n\nKunkel: Germans also have the right to be \""themselves\"" - that is, to live in a community where they do not have to explain themselves constantly and negotiate their existence with immigrants daily. These citizens are serious when they see the new propaganda side by side with North African immigrants as an imposition.\n\nIsn't what we call a \""split\"" actually the normal diversity of opinion in a democratic community?\n\nKunkel: I think a \""split\"" means something different. An archaic friend-foe notion has largely supplanted the culture of discourse. Politicians like Johannes Kahrs and Ralf Stegner have made a significant contribution to this, as have officials such as Sawsan Chebli and Aiman Mazyek, who openly pursue anti-German interests.\n\nSadly, Germans do not have any cultural techniques to counter these fission fungi in human form. Added to this is the government's increasing persecution of dissidents: some are fired for their political opinions, and social relationships are destroyed. There are now an astonishing array of examples of how the state proceeds to force oppositional or uncomfortable intellectuals to their knees by means of material reprisals. The great root of all wars is generally known to be the offense. I would say that the degree of offense the Germans inflict on each other is scary today and could amount to a civil war or something similar.\n\nAllegedly, the AfD and \""the Right\"" are responsible for this split...\n\nKunkel: Both camps blame each other for the split, to be exact. I have seen this in conversations with journalists during the provincial election campaigns in the East in recent weeks.\n\nWhere does this irreconcilability come from? Has nobody tried to counteract this?\n\nKunkel: But of course. In 2017 already I had hoped that talks with media representatives could build bridges. Once it was clear that the AfD was not a flash in the pan, but a new people's party, the mainstream media should have changed their style of reporting.\n\nBy that I mean, it should have ended the hostile fictionalization of the AfD, the newspeak and the frame stories such as the one about a refugee who finds 10 000 euros and hands it over to the police. The opposite is the case. The press is reporting in an even more hostile way than before and the extent of fake news is hard to bear.\n\nSometimes I get the impression that the split you are addressing is wanted by the media and the established parties. They want the escalation, so that Germany can be swept by the iron broom. Fire accelerators seem to me to be the new censorship measures on the Internet. More and more Germans see this as proof that their freedom of expression is being restricted as in a dictatorship. That fuels outrage.\n\nIn the eyes of the establishment, these rightly indignant people have been adopting the role of \""right-wing populist hater\"" even more - a vicious circle! How could the AfD and its supporters ever do it right for the ruling parties? Well, by just shutting up and pretending that the illegal opening of the border in 2015 had no effect on German society. And that's impossible.\n\nIs the topic of immigration essential?\n\nKunkel: Since immigration has been revealed as a kind of invasion in which specialists for manslaughter, child murder and rape set the tone, the majority of Germans are now deeply disillusioned as far as immigration is concerned. Either one protests or one adapts, it is one of two things.\n\nFor example?\n\nKunkel: I'll give you a significant example. My wife goes out in the evening with her girlfriends in Berlin only in sneakers. The reason: The ladies believe that they can run faster in the event of a threat. Absurd, but they no longer rely on the police. That was never the case between 2005 and 2009 when we lived in Berlin.\n\nAngela Merkel would now ask your wife why sneakers or sports shoes are a problem...\n\nKunkel: Because unfortunately she can not choose anymore.\n\nBut the fashion industry says that sneakers can be very nice Sunday shoes too...\n\nKunkel: [laughs] Sure! you can also have \""No means No\"" tattooed on your upper arm for a swimming pool visit. There are some graphic variants of our adaptation to those who sought protection from us.\n\nSpeaking of \""split\"": The wife of a Berlin Senator or a federal minister does not worry about shoes when she goes out...\n\nKunkel: You might be right.\n\nSo the split is not between right and left, but one between the top and ordinary citizens?\n\nKunkel: I agree with that. The problem of the future will be that people with low income will feel the negative effects of migration in its full severity. So we're talking about those citizens who do not drive their children to the Waldorf school in a BMW hybrid or electric car. This remains reserved for the left-liberal elite. Those who can afford it, will soon be residing in a guarded \""gated community\"" with like-minded do-gooders who can hide from reality outside their bionade ghetto [Bionades are a German range of non-alcoholic, organic fermented and carbonated beverages]. In my novel \""Subs\"" I described such an enclave in 2011, in which better-off do-gooders reinvent slavery with illegal migrant workers.\n\nIt does make a difference whether your child goes to school with the son of a Nigerian diplomat or with Nigerian asylum-seekers...\n\nKunkel: That's the point. But the important decisions are made by those whose children go to school with children from diplomats.\n\nAfter all, you are a \""creative artist\"" - how far has your industry actually moved away from the people in recent decades?\n\nKunkel: I would say that the link to the population and their problems has weakened. For example, when we look at film funding, it is noticeable that films are promoted that are thematically relevant to the cultural policy agenda of the Merkel government. The dramatization of a refugee's fate has played a special role for years. Scriptwriters and producers act as the vicarious agents, because this is how they get their hands on running the mine.\n\nThey know what \""those up there\"" want. And a Sascha Lobo with his cockscomb hairstyle wants to be invited to the garden festival of the Federal President to get a piece of the cake in the presence of the worst CDU sycophants.\n\nThis way of worshiping the powerful has meanwhile degenerated into the modus operandi of the cultural scene. Some have even managed to make their own special genre, ingratiation literature, socially acceptable.\n\nWho do you mean?\n\nKunkel: The Spiegel-Online blogger Sibylle Berg is an example. In the commercial for her novel GRM - Brainfuck, she uses a 14-year-old colored man as a token. Berg's PR strategy fits her collection of trite sex-crime stories which look like they've all been read by Pulp Master 20 years ago. Berg, who by the way lives in Zurich, the city with the highest quality of life in Europe, does not even know the milieu that she writes about. Her commercial is therefore at best a marketing gimmick. Basically, she should call herself Sibylle Fake, as that would at least show a sense of self-irony. She should actually be Sibylle Black and the black dwarves, that's even better. But this person is unfortunately dead serious about her \""fight against the right\"".\n\nIn what way?\n\nKunkel: Well, do you remember this encouragement letter to the Antifa that Berg published in Der Spiegel a few years ago? It is just one example of the initially implacable friend-foe thinking that makes a normal exchange of ideas impossible. I believe state artists like Berg are consciously accepting the division of our society. And we had something like that in Germany before.\n\nWhen was that?\n\nKunkel: Well, the National Socialist entertainment industry worked exactly according to this formula. In reality, the Babelsberg films are all propaganda infusions, which is why, for example, the joke piece ENTITY Süß was rightly declared a \""reserved film\"". This is far more perfidious than Berg's film, but the intentions behind it are similar. Many want to become state artists again today ...\n\nYou mentioned Sascha Lobo...\n\nKunkel: A splendid specimen of someone totally disconnected from the people, the new cultural functionaries ...\n\nIs the colorful cockscomb really cheeky and original?\n\nKunkel: No, that's anachronistic. In the late 1970s, when I played in a Frankfurt punk band myself, such hairstyles were still an expression of dissent and no-future. Since one was sometimes mobbed by truck drivers, the cockscomb was, so to speak, always a ticket to a spontaneous fight. The failed advertiser Sascha Lobo carries a quasi-museum piece of hair on his head and probably does not even realize how ridiculous he makes it look. On the other hand, don't speak ill of the dead.\n\nOther people: German comedian Jan Böhmermann. He also describes himself as an arts professional, supports human trafficers, mass immigration and Angela Merkel. What do you have to do to keep people like Böhmermann, Joko Winterscheidt and Klaas Heufer circulating?\n\nKunkel: These guys are all globalization fans, but otherwise pretty much do not care if it just fills up their pockets. Just take a look at the Joko Facebook page. There he gushes about saving the climate and at the same time he constantly jets around the world. He draws social capital from climate change, and that's it. He probably does not notice the discrepancy between his utterances and his lifestyle. But again: this behavior is reminiscent of that of the National Socialist state artists who supported the regime to the bitter end.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nKunkel: Then as now, the political leadership determines the canon of values, which every arts professional who is interested in a career learns in no time. Those who internalize it, do so not least because they expect it to provide them with benefits in terms of money, scholarships, subsidies and social advancement.\n\nThis is quite comparable to the behavior of those Nazi art officials who sank after 1945 into complete insignificance. Just think of Adolf Ziegler or Gert Hippler. Of course, Heinz Rühmann is the best example of such a career. He still filmed his comedies for the Nazis in Berlin in 1944 when the city was regularly being bombed to ruins. For this he received millions of Reichsmarks from the Reich Chamber of Film.\n\nThere are testimonies from Rühmann's team, that in the evening Heinz cruised - champagne in hand - in an open motorboat on the Wannsee when you could hear the Soviet artillery in the distance.\n\nWas Heinz Rühmann the Jan Böhmermann of the 1930s and 1940s?\n\nKunkel: Now that you draw the comparison, I cannot deny it completely. After all, even someone who toes the party line like Böhmermann should use his comedic talent to the bitter end - for good pay, of course - and then claim that he knew nothing about it.\n\nBöhmermann would then probably be successful in an AfD-governed Germany?\n\nKunkel: There's no doubt about his exceptional talent. This sort of folk actor resembles the chameleon, it always comes through somehow. For example, if you ask Böhmermann in 20 years why he called for donations for the tug captain Carola Rackete in 2019, perhaps his answer would be: To prevent further crimes of this apparently severely traumatized daughter of an armaments expert.\n\nConversely, the new system would allow a fictional cultural director Böhmermann to reinterpret his now inglorious past as an \""embedded comedian\"" and fan-boy of the perjurer Merkel ...But let's leave it at that, otherwise I'll get carried away!\n\nWhat happens to art professionals who explicitly do not want to submit to this trend?\n\nKunkel: Life becomes difficult overnight. Even as a well-known writer one has to be able to publish. This obstruction of existence plays into all areas of life. It is almost impossible for an \""outcast\"" art professional to rent an apartment in a city like Berlin. Landlords are also googling their tenants nowadays, and once they get stigmatized by the media, things get tough. Anyone who abandons the consensus has to bear with the consequences. This too is an example of the existing social division.\n\nThey were expelled as well...\n\nKunkel: Halfway, I mean, compared to Pirincci I'm almost still popular with the media. [Akif Pirinçci is a Turkish-born German writer who is best known internationally for his novel Felidae. His statements on feminism, opposition to immigration, and description of Germany as a \""Muslim garbage dump\"" have provoked controversy in Germany and throughout Europe. Ed.]\n\nThe whole thing has good sides too. These days I write with much more enjoyment than before and exactly what I want. I no longer have to endure all the advice of the leftist pals who always wanted to protect me from myself. By the way, I used to be called by the head of the Literary Colloquium Berlin a prime example of a \""good leftist author\"" because of my \""socio-critical writing\"".\n\nI've never made a secret of the milieu from my youth of US G.I.s, drug addicts and decrepit whore ghosts who went shopping at the IAA. Leftist cultural bobos thought it was great. They did not get that at the core of my work there was always self-assertion. I have never changed, but the cultural industry has. A German writer who sees in writing an act of self-assertion is automatically a right-winger today. This automatism also promotes the social division you mentioned.\n\nAlmost all the important decisions of the last 20 years have been made against the will of the majority of people: EURO currency introduction, Lisbon treaties, NATO operations, opening of borders in 2015, Russia sanctions... How does a political system manage to keep this up?\n\nKunkel: The examples you mention are undoubtedly the triggers of social division. I am sure that someday this will be seen in a historical review.\n\nIn another European country, people would never have accepted such a policy. In France car tires would have been burned...\n\nKunkel: That's right. And that is exactly why Germany is so perfect for the great multi-ethnic experiment that [German-American political scientist] Yascha Mounk spoke about - one could say, because of the decades-long re-education of the people. Because the Germans have learned that their politicians always decide to the detriment of the people. Resistance was therefore unlikely in 2015. Imagine somebody telling the Frenchmen or the Italians that they were planning to change their people completely, to disperse it into a migrant mass, to \""thin them out\"" genetically, as Joschka Fischer once boorishly said.\n\nNo, not only car tires would burn. The apathy of the German people, who are known to despise their peers, is even more frightening.\n\nIn Switzerland, many decisions are made through the instrument of plebiscite - that is, through direct democracy. Wouldn't it be an instrument for Germany, at least to mitigate the social divide?\n\nKunkel: In Switzerland, the plebiscite has hitherto helped prevent a division of society. The political camps still pay tribute to each other, despite the greatest differences of opinion. I believe that direct democracy would be the appropriate means to finally heal this divided German people. The people would feel responsible and not bossed around, it would make them trust in the politicians again.\n\nWhich is probably the reason why all established parties in Germany are against binding referendums.\n\nKunkel: [laughs] I would say they are not ready yet, they have not tasted enough defeats yet. Only when the CDU nationwide falls below 20 percent, would most understand that the routine betrayal of their own people is no longer worthwhile.\n\nThere would probably be hell to pay for the fact that the living conditions of the German people have worsened steadily since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Germans, for their part, will finally refuse to pay for everything. The fight for the introduction of the plebiscite should be worthwhile to remedy the deep rift in our society and to secure social peace for at least the next twenty or thirty years."
Jamaat-ud-Dawah,1,"Introduction\n\nHi, welcome to \""Behind the Mask.\"" This will be 25YL's review of the current theories and analysis out there following the airing of each episode of HBO's Watchmen. We'll be releasing these on Thursdays, to give the online communities some time to digest the episode and see what the best and most interesting theories are to date.\n\nThat said, these articles will contain spoilers. Lots and lots of spoilers. We'll not go into NDA-breaking spoiler territory, but anything that is out there and publicly available is going to be fair game here. We're going to be trying to figure out all the answers to all the questions, as well as pointing out some of the more interesting Easter eggs and plot point details that you might have missed on first watching.\n\nIf that's not your cup of tea, you might want to just check out our weekly review of each episode, releasing on Tuesdays and helmed by Laura Stewart.\n\nSo let's jump right into it. There's a lot to talk about.\n\nPeteypedia\n\nOK, first thing, the writers of the show are apparently going to be putting out supplemental material each week on a website called \""Peteypedia.\"" The premise of the website is that these are files pulled together on the newly re-introduced computer assigned to FBI Special Agent Dale Petey (a nod to FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper of Twin Peaks). This is apparently at least partially the brain child of Jeff \""Doc\"" Jensen, one of the writers on the show, who did Entertainment Weekly's podcast on Twin Peaks Season 3 called, quite cleverly, \""A Twin Peaks Podcast: A Podcast About Twin Peaks.\"" He's a pretty big fan of Twin Peaks, as is showrunner Damon Lindelof, so expect more than a few Twin Peaks Easter egg nods in this show.\n\nThis first dump includes four articles that provide a lot of interesting back story. The lack of certain technology (internet, cell phones, etc.) is explained, there's some back story to the silent film featured in the 1921 scene, the full text of the \""Veidt Declared Dead\"" newspaper article is included, and it features Agent Petey's analysis of Rorschach's journal as pertaining to the premature declaration of Veidt's death. Your Reddit team, hard at work for you, already has a thread summarizing much of the relevant content. There's a lot of world building that the writers put in and it's nice to see it is not going to waste.\n\nOther useful background material you might want to peruse in your free time would include:\n\nThe full (all 12 chapters, plus The Black Freighter) Watchmen motion comic on YouTube -- the original Watchmen comic brought to life; a great way to \""read\"" it for free if you do not have a copy The article \""The Case for Reparations\"" by Ta-Nehisi Coates, on The Atlantic -- cited by Damon Lindelof as an inspiration for the series The Tulsa Historical Society and Museum's page on the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre -- a good primer on the real-world event that was also an inspiration for the series Was the Chief Corrupt?\n\nIn the silent movie, the masked hero takes down the corrupt sheriff. So right away, we have potential foreshadowing that the police chief was corrupt. The Chief was listening to a right-wing radio talk show on his drive out to the hospital (if that's at all where he was headed). He also referred to Looking Glass' mask as his \""face,\"" as Rorschach would. And of course he was doing cocaine at the party (though no one seems too freaked out about that).\n\nDid the Chief know he was going to die? We never got to see the text of the page he received. It could have been from anyone. He mysteriously insisted on getting into uniform for the late-night hospital visit. Rather conspicuous. Then he promised his wife he'd get \""one of the boys\"" to drive him there, but didn't even give it a thought as he got in his truck. He gets out of his truck, fairly calmly, looks at the tires all blown and then walks over to the rumble strip, like he expected something like this to happen.\n\nAlong with the speculation that the Chief may have been corrupt, there was also pre-show speculation that he might be Daniel Dreiberg, Nite Owl II from the comics. One of the only reasons to perhaps think this is that the original Watchmen began with the death of a superhero in his civilian alter ego, so maybe this incarnation should begin with the death of a superhero in his civilian alter ego. However, the Peteypedia files directly contradict this, stating that Dan Dreiberg is in federal custody currently.\n\nA lot of theorizing is going on about the picture of a young ENTITYd sitting on an older man's lap, the older man being in a police officer uniform. If old enough (i.e., a grandfather or great grandfather, not a father), the old man could have been present at the 1921 Race Riots, where the police were largely complicit with the massacre that was going on. It could be establishing a legacy of racism in the Chief's family tree, though that doesn't mean he couldn't have been trying to change that.\n\nLord of a Country Manor\n\nProbably the biggest mystery established even before the pilot aired has been: who is Jeremy Irons playing in the show? At the San Diego Comic-Con panel, he was introduced as \""Probably Who You Think He Is.\"" In official casting lists, he's called out as \""Lord of a Country Manor.\"" Of course, everyone \""thinks\"" he is playing Adrian Veidt, a.k.a. Ozymandias, but no one officially associated with the show will confirm this. Now, after the premier, it's clear this is intended to be one of those season-long mysteries that will be spooled out to us scene by scene, with hopefully a big reveal in the season finale that gives us the final answer.\n\nSome are theorizing that it can't be that easy, there must be a twist. They wouldn't be so coy about all of this if there wasn't a twist in store. The only real evidence so far that he's Ozymandias is that Irons looks the part, and (more of a stretch) the yellow and purple icing on the cake somewhat resembles the regal gold and purple of Ozymandias' superhero outfit from the comics. The leading non-Veidt theory is that he could be Dr. Manhattan. Why Dr. Manhattan would assume a human form, let alone an old man human form, is a tad unclear. As a minor bit of evidence though, he has no qualms about sitting around nude in front of the staff.\n\nSpeaking of the staff, those two are a strange pair. Mr. Phillips and Ms. Crookshanks display no reaction to the master's nudity. They put an entire honeycomb into a cake recipe. They mix up a horseshoe and knife. They have the ability to manufacture and assemble a functioning watch based on some discarded drawings. Theories abound. Are they aliens? Androids? GMO pod people (my new favorite phrase -- that came from the \""Watchmen on HBO\"" Facebook group)? If the \""Lord\"" is Ozymandias, he's certainly no stranger to genetically engineering artificial life forms. Though Dr. Manhattan also talked of leaving the galaxy to go attempt to make life himself. Could this storyline be happening on an entirely different planet in an entirely different galaxy?\n\nOne of the more persistent theories is that, assuming he is Ozymandias, he is trying to re-create the experiment that led to Dr. Manhattan gaining his powers. The play title, \""The Watchmaker's Son\"" would be an obvious reference to Dr. Manhattan (who was a watchmaker's son), and he wants the servants to \""star\"" in it. As part of this theory then, the servants may be clones of John and Laurie. Though once again it's unclear why Laurie would need to be part of this.\n\nAlso unclear is why Ozymandias would want a second deity-level superbeing around in the first place, especially when he had to go to such great lengths to mask his activities from Dr. Manhattan last time. He already had a similar machine in his hands at the end of the Watchmen comic, having used it against Dr. Manhattan, and he didn't try to make himself or some underling into a second superbeing at that time (at least, not that we know of so far). Personally, I don't think he'd take the chance. Ozymandias was uniquely situated to understand the inhumanity of Dr. Manhattan. After all, John was thinking of wiping the slate clean of humanity until Laurie talked him out of it.\n\nGetting back to the servants, they are celebrating an \""anniversary\"" for the master, one that he had forgotten. Is this the anniversary of his \""death\"" that they are celebrating, putting this scene a year into the future? Or the anniversary of his disappearance, putting it a bit into the past (per Peteypedia, Veidt disappeared in 2012). In the \""In The Weeks Ahead\"" clips, we see one of the \""Lord\"" sitting in what appears to be a dungeon cell, and again he has a cake, the exact same cake, but with at least six candles on it this time. That might indicate we are potentially going to see five years pass and his circumstances much changed. Given that he disappeared in 2012, this could even be a series of flashbacks covering the intervening seven years, catching his timeline up to the present-day 2019 timeline eventually.\n\nHowever, the \""In The Weeks Ahead\"" clips reveal a lot more than just that dungeon cell scene. In those scenes, it's clear that he's not just living in a manor with no apparent modern technology (e.g., the typewriter), he may actually be living in the past. ENTITYging by the costuming and building interiors, perhaps in the 1700s timeframe? There is also a scene of him climbing into what I would guess is an H. G. Wells-esque time machine.\n\nSo here's my theory that I'm going to put out there. This is indeed Ozymandias, but the twist is that he's in the past. His plan yielded macro-level world peace, but it did not resolve micro-level racial tensions. So he builds a time machine, intending to go back to 1921 Tulsa, Oklahoma, seeing it as a turning point in America's race relations that he will \""fix\"" somehow. He was messing with tachyons in the original comic already, right? But he overshot or miscalculated somehow and ended up in classical era England (the castle scenes are filmed in Wales). Or maybe Dr. Manhattan banished him to this past, to either punish or imprison him. Maybe John made the butler and maid to serve as Adrian's jailers, and that's why they have slight inhuman tendencies. Either way, he's now building a time machine in an attempt to get back to either the present or 1921 to fulfill his mission.\n\nOne last bizarre twist to discuss with regard to the servants. In the IMDb cast list, there are two actors listed for playing each role. (Yes, I know, always take pre-airing IMDb cast lists, especially from a Damon Lindelof show, with a grain of salt, but this is what it says as of today.) Mr. Phillips is played by Tom Mison and Edward Crook. Tom Mison is who we saw in Episode 1, and he continues in the role throughout the remaining eight episodes. But in those remaining eight episodes, Edward Crook is also listed as playing Mr. Phillips. Ms. Crookshanks is played by Sara Vickers and Christie Amery. Sara Vickers is who we saw in Episode 1, but then she is apparently going to move on to play a different role, that of Erika Manson/Marionette, in the remaining episodes. That sounds like possibly a mask's secret identity/code name, although there is also a supporting actor with the role \""Marionette Puppeteer\"" listed as well (only one episode). Christie Amery will apparently move into the Ms. Crookshanks role starting with Episode 2 and remain in it throughout the rest of the season. What in the world all of this means, I cannot guess at this time.\n\nLife on Mars\n\nSo we have been promised that Dr. Manhattan will be part of this new series, and sure enough we got a brief glimpse of him in a \""Breaking News\"" banner on TV. In that clip, we see what looks like a spy satellite image of Dr. Manhattan standing in front of a structure on Mars, and then the structure collapses upon itself.\n\nFirst of all, that structure looks a lot like the castle that the \""Lord\"" is residing in (see https://i.imgur.com/78cpGDy.png). And, on top of that, in the \""In The Weeks Ahead\"" trailers, Angela's son Topher is building something out of Lego-like building blocks that also looks a lot like the same structure.\n\nThe fact that there is a toy set of the structure (assuming it was a boxed set) seems to indicate it had been there a while. Like those Lego Architecture sets you can get of famous buildings like the Taj Mahal and the Eiffel Tower. Maybe this structure was something Dr. Manhattan had left behind originally. In which case, Dr. Manhattan reappearing and destroying it could indicate a change of plans for him -- a transition to some new project. The similarity to the \""Country Manor\"" might indicate, if the \""Lord\"" is Ozymandias, that he and Dr. Manhattan are working together again. Perhaps the \""Country Manor\"" is actually on Mars, in some large-scale version of the greenhouse Ozymandias has in the Arctic. Or again, perhaps the \""Country Manor\"" is some sort of prison for Ozymandias and he's working on getting himself free of it.\n\nPurple Rain\n\nDuring the interrogation, the man in Angela's trunk is asked \""Do you believe that transdimensional attacks are hoaxes staged by the U.S. government?\"" Apparently these squid showers happen all the time, with the old nuclear air raid sirens now being repurposed to provide warning to pull out your umbrella or pull over your car. They may have also replaced \""duck and cover\"" drills in the schools, as evidenced by the \""Anatomy of a Squid\"" and \""Squidfall Cycle\"" posters in the classroom.\n\nThey are also at least national, and likely world-wide. The Tulsa Sun newspaper that the old man in the wheelchair is reading includes an article headline reading \""Boise Squid Shower Destroys Homeless Camp, Kills 2.\"" Luckily, the baby squids on the windshield dissolve before Angela even has a chance to completely wipe them off and are easily hosed off the sidewalks. How convenient.\n\nSo what is the purpose of these squid showers? It would appear to at least be to keep the interdimensional threat alive and real, though you can see that people no longer seem to be taking the attacks very seriously. Maybe it's something that was set up 30+ years ago and made great sense at the time, but now just annoyingly keeps on happening and no one is able to stop them?\n\nThat would depend on who is pulling them off. The government? Veidt? Dr. Manhattan? Veidt would certainly have the technology and perhaps the know-how to make such a thing happen, and then perhaps his disappearance leaves the machinery still running on autopilot?\n\nPresidential Timelines\n\nWe already knew that in the Watchmen universe, Nixon got the 22nd Amendment rescinded and served more than two terms. In the comic, it was noted that \""RR\"" was going to run against him in the upcoming 1988 presidential election. Apparently that was not Ronald Reagan, but rather was Robert Redford. It looks like Nixon was president until his death in 1989 (the poster in the classroom lists dates 1968-1989). Ford took over through 1992, at which time Redford was elected (having lost his initial 1988 bid against Nixon).\n\nThat means Nixon had 6 terms ('68, '72, '76, '80, '84, '88), the last being partial; Ford remains the only president to never have been elected with his one partial term; and then Redford is on his eighth term ('92, '96, '00, '04, '08, '12, '14, '16). The newspaper that the guy in Angela's trunk was reading announced that Redford would not be seeking reelection in 2020.\n\nA junior Senator Keane is running for president this go-around and is identified by the radio talk show host as \""Joe Junior,\"" presumably the son of the senator who introduced the Keene Act that outlawed masked vigilantes. Though note that in the closed captioning (again, take with a grain of salt) the younger one is Keane with an \""EA\"" and the elder is Keene with an \""EE.\"" The IMDb cast list does indeed list Senator Keane (James Wolk) and Senator Keene Sr. (Ted Johnson). Same letter pair swap. Strange indeed.\n\nWho is Will Reeves?\n\nFirst theory that is practically fact at this point, is that Lou Gossett Jr.'s character, Will Reeves, the man in the wheelchair, is also the boy who escaped the 1921 Tulsa Race Riots. If he's 105 now, he would have been 7 in 1921. The math adds up. The boy and the old man both have a matching conspicuous mole on the cheek. And of course, just to beat us over the head with the link, Reeves is holding the \""WATCH OVER THIS BOY\"" paper that 1921 Boy was packed off with. Though if that's the original piece of paper, being nearly 100 years old now it ought to be in complete tatters. Just sayin'.\n\nSecond theory is that this is the Hooded Justice, founding member of The Minutemen who never had their civilian identity exposed. Assuming Will Reeves is 1921 Boy, he may have taken his last name from the silent movie character, \""Bass Reeves, the Black Marshal of Oklahoma\"" (identified in the Peteypedia files). If so, he might also have taken a costume cue or two as well, with the big black cloak and the rope. Now, countering this theory, it has been pointed out that historically the Hooded Justice appears to be white under the mask. But I'd point out that Angela/Sister Night paints over her eyes in black, so it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to believe that a black man would don \""white face\"" to hide his identity.\n\nIn an interview for The Hollywood Reporter, Regina King (Angela Abar) says the relationship between Will and Angela will \""open up your heart and break it at the same time.\"" She calls it a \""wonderful story of legacy.\"" It almost certainly has to be that her ancestry reaches back to the baby who escaped the Tulsa Race Riots with him. When he calls her to come out to the big oak tree, he specifically asks about her father, Marcus Abar. (Or was that Reeves? In the \""In the Weeks Ahead\"" preview, he calls Angela out for cursing too much -- yet in this phone call she is told \""don't wear no goddamned mask.\"")\n\nLegacy\n\nLet's talk about one more theory pointing to potential legacy links back to the original Minutemen and/or the 1980s Watchmen.\n\nThere's an interesting theory on Reddit about yet another daughter of the Comedian. In the comic, a pregnant Vietnamese woman confronts the Comedian in front of Dr. Manhattan and the Comedian shoots her. The scene ends with Dr. Manhattan looking thoughtfully at her body. He could have saved that baby (the woman looked imminently due) and that baby would be in their late 40s/early 50s now. One thought is that the baby could be Angela, but that would require a bit more than just \""remixing\"" on the writing team's part. She could, however, be the Asian lady featured in the \""In the Weeks Ahead\"" trailer (identified as Lady Trieu in IMDb). We'll keep an eye on this one.\n\nEaster Eggs The address of Angela's bakery is 119. A nod to Twin Peaks fans? The code to Angela's superhero lair is 1985, a nod to the comic, which was set in 1985. Rather obvious, but the blood dripped on the Chief's badge is a nod to the classic Comedian's button with the blood drip, that became the icon of the original comic series. Lindelof points out that the Comedian actually referred to his smiley face pin as a \""badge,\"" so in both instances it's a blood drip on a badge. The egg smiley face Angela made even has a bit of blood in the egg that makes up the right eye, as another nod to the Comedian's button in the comic. The overhead view of the round dining room table also forms the button image, with a napkin taking the place of the blood drip. The Chief has a copy of Under the Hood on his desk. This was the tell-all book about the Minutemen referenced in the comic, written by Hollis Mason, the original Nite Owl. As she walks to the bakery, Angela passes someone holding a picket sign reading \""The Future is Bright,\"" mirroring the nutter holding the \""The End is Nigh\"" sign in the original comic. Of course, that nutter turned out to be Walter Kovacs, a.k.a. Rorschach. So is that guy important to the story? Stay tuned. In the Chief's office, Angela has an owl coffee cup. The premise of the silent film, titled Trust in the Law!, was that \""a man in white is chased by a man in black across the Oklahoma plain\"" (from Peteypedia). This could be a mirror reference to Stephen King's The Dark Tower series (which begins with the line \""The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed\""). The movie version of The Dark Tower, while awful, did feature an interesting casting decision to cast a black actor in the roll of the Gunslinger, a white man in the novels. In fact, the silent movie star Bass Reeves looks quite a bit like The Dark Tower star Idris Elba. There is also a brief glimpse in the \""In The Weeks Ahead\"" clips of Sister Night, all in black, pursuing another mask, all in white, through an industrial warehouse of some sort. \""Unforgettable,\"" the song playing while the Chief gets dressed to go to the hospital, also played in the background when the Comedian was killed in the Watchmen. So the movie is not completely forgotten by the writing team here. Angela's last name, Abar, could be a nod to the 1977 blaxploitation movie Abar, the First Black Superman (source: Reddit). The \""We Do\"" podcast noticed that the Hooded Justice began his crime fighting career in 1938, the same year Superman was first published. They also point out that the blood under the door when Angela beats the crap out of the guy they just interrogated is a nod to when Rorschach kills Big Shot in the prison from the comic. Quick Takes The Nixonville/Seventh Kavalry people are displaying the old 50-star flags. The traffic stop guy had it on his hat and the guy in Angela's trunk had one in the window of his trailer. It apparently has become the new Confederate flag. At the end of the all-hands meeting, the Chief says \""Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?\"" and all the assembled officers reply \""Nos custodimus!\"" These are Latin phrases and translate literally as \""Who will guard the guards themselves?\"" and \""We guard!\"" (I believe the closed captions has the reply incorrectly written as \""los costodimus,\"" resulting in \""we uphold,\"" which of course does not make as much sense.) Or alternatively translated as \""Who watches the watchmen?\"" / \""We watch!\"" \""The Future Is Bright\"" sign has a Statue of Liberty inverted on it. Immediately after that, we see Will Reeves' newspaper saying the Statue was closed because of KKK vandalism. At the very least, this shows that the racial tensions are not just local to Tulsa, Oklahoma. The American Hero Story: Minutemen documentary opening did not include The Silhouette. Possibly because she was outted as a lesbian. The episode title, \""It's Summer and We're Running out of Ice,\"" comes from a song in the play Oklahoma. The song is titled \""Pore ENTITY is Daid,\"" and it gets to that line just as the blood drop drips onto his badge. The Chief's name is ENTITYd, ENTITYd Crawford. The opening, where the utopian \""Black Wall Street\"" was being destroyed and the parents send their child off to safety, parallels the origin story of Superman. Which might mean that the little baby is his cousin, Supergirl? The Hollywood Reporter clarifies the in-world origin of the \""Seventh Kavalry\"" name: \""In the comics, Veidt gives an interview with New Frontiersman rivals Nova Express in which he draws a line in the sand between those who root for Armageddon -- the horsemen of the apocalypse -- and those who are fighting against it: 'The Seventh Cavalry,' he says, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Custer's last stand. The Seventh Kavalry have co-opted Veidt's own joke aENTITYnd married it with the face of the one crimefighter who opposed him.\"" (Note: I've corrected \""Calvary\""/\""Kalvary\"" references in the quote for \""Cavalry\""/\""Kavalry\"".) The first-letter \""K\"" for \""C\"" swap would apparently be a nod to the KKK. Here is a Reddit thread that has an image of that interview text from the comic. This also explains why the pager call for a Kavalry attack is \""Little Big Horn,\"" a reference to when Custer's real world 7th Cavalry met their end. Apparently the 200 pounds that Will Reeves was referring to being able to lift was the police chief's dead body? Of course, that would imply he was killed before he was hanged. We'll see. Killing off the big-name star was the original plan with Lost. Jack was going to die in the pilot episode. The closing credits included \""based on characters co-created for DC by Dave Gibbons.\"" No mention of he-who-must-not-be-named (not by Damon Lindelof anyway). Ouch. Just as it's weird that the Chief was listening to a right-wing radio talk show, the 7K guy who gets pulled over in the beginning was blasting out hip-hop, which seems a little odd for a white supremacist. The \""WATCH OVER THIS BOY\"" note is written on the back of a German WWI propaganda sheet encouraging black soldiers to surrender themselves over rather than fight (see this Reddit thread for an image/discussion). The scroll at the bottom of the \""Dr. Manhattan on Mars\"" breaking news story includes a headline \""Water found on Mars.\"" By NASA or by Dr. Manhattan? In the \""Absolute Edition\"" of the Watchmen trade paperback, a section penned by Alan Moore shows that Hooded Justice was originally going to be called \""Brother Night.\"" Which would mirror Angela's code name of \""Sister Night\"" (source: Reddit). The significance of the head of lettuce being tossed into the patrol car is that the 7K guy was telling the truth, he was just hauling lettuce. The \""Watchmen for Nixon\"" podcast believes that the truck featured in the traffic stop is the same one that sported the 50-caliber machine gun in the 7K headquarters raid. They also point out that the Chief had two bullet wound scars on his shoulder, seen while he is getting dressed. Possibly to be addressed later in flashbacks addressing White Night? The \""We Do\"" podcast believes the 7K member who takes the cyanide pill before Sister Night gets to him is the same guy from the traffic stop.\n\nThat's all for now.

ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES,0,"Saad Hariri announced that he was leaving his post as Prime Minister of Lebanon, and stated that he had come to a dead-end after two weeks of mass protests in Lebanon, during which its participants accused the government of corruption and creating conditions for a possible economic collapse. Saad Hariri served in this role since December 2016.\n\nForceful demonstrations erupted all over the country on 17 October when the Lebanese government announced tax hikes on tobacco and internet calling applications. Participants in the mass protests, precipitated by these developments, have set up road and motorway blockades and demanded that the government resigned and political reforms were carried out. However, after the head of state announced the start of a number of economic reforms and that anti-corruption measures would be taken, thousands of protesters, having deemed such actions as insufficient, once again came out into the streets all over the country, stating that the government was incapable of implementing sound economic policies, and accusing politicians of rampant corruption and abuses of power.\n\nInterestingly, many politicians in the nation are of completely different opinions (which coincide with their religious views and party affiliations) regarding the situation in Lebanon. For instance, President Michel Aoun has expressed his solidarity with the demonstrators, who came out in protest all over the nation in recent days in order to show how much the people of Lebanon were suffering. Yet the Patriarch of Lebanon's Maronite church, Bechara Boutros al-Rahi, stated that the reforms adopted to calm the nation-wide protests were the right \first step\"", but a new Cabinet of Lebanon would need to implement them. In his televised address, Bechara Boutros al-Rahi said that he supported the demonstrators, but also urged them to exercise restraint.\n\nSpeaker of the Parliament of Lebanon Nabih Berri, on the other hand, stated that the resignation of all the members of the government (headed by Saad Hariri) would not resolve the deep-seated socio-economic crisis in the country and would only exacerbate the situation. The Lebanese daily newspaper Al Joumhouria reported that he thought the government ought to take immediate measures aimed at kick-starting economic reforms in Lebanon.\n\nWhile one group of protesters put up tents in main squares, the other continued with its road blockades. In the meantime, they continue loudly chanting one of their key rallying cries: \""All of them means all of them.\"" Apparently, it refers to all the political organizations as well as numerous parties in Lebanon.\n\nAll of this spurred Arabic media outlets to report that the demonstrators had received operational and financial support from a number of Arabic nations. Well-informed sources told Al-Ahed News that these countries were the ones paying for the logistics costs and all the other expenses, including those for transportation, umbrellas, tents with Lebanese flags, portable toilet booths, and supplies of food and water. They also said that everyone who obstructed the normal flow of traffic on roads on any given day received $100 each, and anyone who remained in or around a tent overnight got $150 per head.\n\nThe protesters welcomed Saad Hariri's resignation but it is unclear what would happen next. He can remain in the role of the acting Prime Minister so as to continue with his duties. And for now, this is the only way out of the crisis. Lebanese media outlets have reported that as acting Prime Minister Saad Hariri promised to put together a cabinet of technocrats that would not include any other political party representatives.\n\nIn the meantime, the economic crisis engulfing the nation is worsening. According to Reuters, entrepreneurs in Beirut are starting to conduct transactions in US dollars, and the Syndicate of Gas Station Owners has warned consumers that there was only several days' worth of fuel left because of interruptions in supply.\n\nIt is well known that Lebanon has experienced long-term crises before. A complex system ensures division of power among different groups so that the highest posts are occupied by Shiites, Sunnis and Christians. So far it has prevented the nation from succumbing to civil war, but also created wide patronage networks and led to nepotism, thus, for the most part, preventing the government from making important decisions or providing public services in a reliable manner. Incidentally, the protesters are calling for an overhaul of the entire political system with the view of forming a secular government capable of solving many issues plaguing the nation in the interest of all Lebanese people.\n\nIt certainly makes sense to focus on the viewpoint and reaction of Tehran in this case. It is well known that Saad Hariri had previously announced he was leaving his post under fairly strange circumstances in November 2017. He made this statement abroad, apparently, during his visit to Saudi Arabia. At the time, sources close to Saad Hariri from the upper echelons of power and high-level government officials of Lebanon pointed out that Riyadh had forced the then Prime Minister to resign from his post by placing him under house arrest. Michel Aoun also stated that the Lebanese Prime Minister was being held by Saudi Arabia against his will. This led to speculation that Riyadh had forced Saad Hariri to resign on account of the rise in tensions, at the time, in the relationship between the oil-rich kingdom and Iran, which has always had close ties with and exerted influence on the numerous parties of Lebanon.\n\nAt present, a spokesperson for Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Abbas Mousavi, said that Tehran stressed the need for unity among all of Lebanon's clans, parties and people. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has urged the political parties and politicians to preserve unity and ensure mutual understanding in order to resolve the current tricky situation after the Prime Minister of Lebanon Saad Hariri had left his post. Abbas Mousavi called for \""unity among all political groups and parties in Lebanon to maintain security and stability in the country and meet the legitimate demands of the Lebanese people.\""\n\nOnly time will tell what means will be used to deal with the political and economic crises in this nation, and whether they will be resolved in the interests of Lebanese people. Still, at the same time, it is readily apparent that as the state of affairs in Syria is improving (a political dialogue has begun there), the situations in both Lebanon and Iraq, where protests had started practically simultaneously, are getting worse. We are left with a fairly clear impression that many forces, within and outside the country, have skillfully taken advantage of the hardships there to make a move in this fairly important region in their own interests. This is evident and the Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Hosseini Khamenei has clearly stated as such. He also warned that the recent upheavals in a number of nations in the region, including Iraq and Lebanon, are the result of interference by Washington, several other Western countries and reactionary regimes in this part of the world.\n\nViktor Mikhin, corresponding member of the Russian ENTITY, exclusively for the online magazine \""New Eastern Outlook.\""\n\nfrom https://journal-neo.org/2019/11/08/lebanon-on-fire-as-protests-and-demonstrations-rage-on/\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n"""
Google,0,"The Promotion Fix is an exclusive biweekly column for The Drum from Samuel Scott, a global keynote marketing speaker who is a former journalist, newspaper editor, and director of marketing and communications in the high-tech industry. Follow him @samueljscott.\n\nShould mainstream news outlets first and foremost create profits for shareholders or neutrally, objectively and thoroughly educate the public? That is the battle for the soul of journalism today.\n\nFrom bias to neutrality and back\n\nThe idea that journalists should be neutral and fair is relatively recent. In the US, newspapers took sides during the Revolutionary War. Throughout the 1800s, publications were essentially propaganda tools of political parties. Late in the century, 'yellow journalism' yelled sensationalist headlines, published scandal-mongering stories and even helped to provoke the mistaken Spanish-American War.\n\nBut business changed things in the early 1900s. Publication owners discovered that offering advertising was far more profitable than selling subscriptions. Of course, having more readers meant that the newspapers could charge more money -- so the goal was to attract the widest audience possible through being moderate and non-partisan.\n\nThe US Civil War decades earlier even played a role. The cost of sending telegrams with battlefield reports was expensive, so correspondents developed the inverted pyramid along with a concise and 'just the facts' writing style that would later become the basis of 'objective journalism.'\n\nStill, objectivity did not become the only standard. For the first two decades of the 20th century, 'muckraking' investigative journalists focused on exposing corruption and other misdeeds in the government and corporate worlds. In the 1990s, talk radio became dominated by right-wing hosts. For years, the highest rated cable TV news network has been the rabidly conservative Fox News.\n\nThe growth and decline of advertising\n\nObjectivity became the goal in most journalism because it was the most profitable model in the mid-20th century world of reaching a mass audience and attracting the most advertisers.\n\nBut then the advertisers started to disappear. Classified advertising was the biggest source of revenue for newspapers until Craigslist and then websites such as eBay, Realtor.com and Cars.com appeared and let people sell stuff to each other for free or cheap. According to the Newspaper Association of America, classified ad income fell 77% from a peak of $19.6bn in 2000 to $4.6bn in 2012.\n\nAnd that was only the beginning. Analyst Thomas Baekdal added ENTITY's revenue to this chart that has become infamous in media circles:\n\nFacebook has become the trendy company to criticise - and I have done my fair share - but it was ENTITY that drew first blood. And it was a massacre.\n\nToday, everyone is selling ad space. Amazon became the number three digital ad platform in the US last year. Apple is reportedly looking to distribute ads on websites such as Snapchat and Pinterest. Microsoft has LinkedIn. Even Uber wants to become an ad company. Just remember what early Facebook employee Jeff Hammerbacher told Bloomberg Businessweek in 2011: \The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.\""\n\nBut the problem is that there are only so many advertiser dollars to go around. And what does basic economics say happens when the supply of ad space increases? Prices - and therefore publisher revenue - decrease.\n\nThe decline in advertising revenue is especially hurting an industry that was never a gold mine in the first place. (\""No one goes into journalism to get rich,\"" a boss once told me.) Even online publishers - which have much lower operating costs - are in trouble as ENTITY and Facebook suck up more advertiser spend and everyone else competes for the scraps.\n\nTake Mashable. BuzzFeed News. Vice Media. Mic. Gigaom. All of these publications and more have shut down, sold for a fraction of a prior valuation or are greatly missing revenue projections. And I'm not even discussing net profits. In January 2019, more than 2,000 media jobs were lost over a period of two weeks at media companies including BuzzFeed, Vice and the Huffington Post. Most of those publications were funded by venture capital - and I still have no idea why.\n\n\""You cannot apply tech startup economics to a journalism company and expect it to operate ethically,\"" Aram Zucker-Scharff, ad tech engineering director at The Washington Post's Research, Experimentation and Development group, rightly tweeted. \""All VC-based startups are operating on a set of incentives which are already unethical, but doubly so for journalists.\""\n\nPerhaps those venture capitalists should have talked to my former boss. VCs ruin everything - good journalism does not and should not scale. (The only success story I have heard: Sarah Lacy recently announced that she has sold Pando, a news site she founded that covers Silicon Valley. But the reasons for the sale are not entirely positive.)\n\nMaybe news should not be profitable\n\n\""Someone once said that the worst thing that ever happened to journalism was that 60 Minutes became profitable,\"" Dan Kennedy, a media analyst and journalism professor at Northeastern University in Boston, told me.\n\nBroadcast TV news programming in the US was never meant to be profitable. The big three networks - ABC, CBS and NBC - delivered the news to the country for the prestige for their brands and to satisfy Federal Communications Commission public service requirements. And they gladly did it at a loss.\n\nThen, CBS released 60 Minutes in the late 1960s. The news magazine was almost like a television show in which the journalists were the protagonists who were the modern muckrakers exposing the bad guys. It was a Nielsen top 10 hit. The owners of news organisations of all types have wanted similar results ever since.\n\n\""Over the past two generations, we've seen newspapers that were once family-owned, supported by modest profits, fall into the hands of corporate chains,\"" Kennedy added. \""Before the economic model for newspapers began to be undermined by the internet, some of these chains insisted on profit margins of 30%, 40% or even 50%. Now, as the business declines, these chains continue to insist on short-term gains, cutting their newsrooms to the bone while squeezing out the last few drops of profit.\""\n\nContrary to what the VCs who funded the failed media outlets probably think, real journalism is not hiring glorified bloggers, placing them in a mind-numbing open plan office and underpaying them to pump out countless pieces of clickbait content widgets with accompanying ads. Real journalism takes time and money to travel, research, question and review. Real journalism takes talent.\n\nHow journalism can survive\n\nBut today, it needs help. Here are some possible solutions to explore.\n\nBuild an original brand. Successful media companies today do not function like the aforementioned widget factories. Stand for something. Personally, I like what The Washington Post has done in these troubling times.\n\nUnless you are a general interest publication such as BBC or a weekly newspaper that is the only outlet covering a small town, it will become increasingly important to focus on a specific niche. TechCrunch is the main outlet covering the high-tech world, but Lacy's Pando, for example, is a subscription-based outlet that focuses partly on the seedy underbelly of that industry.\n\nTo this day, most private British publications are associated with a certain political viewpoint. In many instances, journalism in the US today is echoing that practice and somewhat returning to the days of yore. Yes, we should always start with the facts and not fall into 'yellow journalism' again. But the facts can be discussed in different contexts and from different angles.\n\nScott Galloway recently wrote the brand era is \""drawing to a close\"". I would argue that it has never been more important. In a media context, your brand is what you write and which writers you publish. (And in advertising, marketing's dynamic duo of Les Binet and Peter Field have found that at least 50% of tactical media spend should be on brand rather than activation.)\n\nMore features, less news. There are countless websites, online news aggregators and discussion forums where people can learn what happened yesterday. Unless you cover a niche such as The Drum and the marketing and media industries, most publications do not need to spend too much time reporting on so-called 'straight news'. Publish fewer articles - but better ones. It is always about quality over quantity.\n\nThe differentiation between outlets should lie in features, analysis and opinion - the types of original articles with original thoughts that appear nowhere else. But, of course, the pieces should be measured and reasonable - not the outrage that made people believe that a European country blew up an American ship.\n\nDiversify your offerings. As news itself becomes less profitable, media companies are looking elsewhere. The Times of Israel recently introduced a 'membership' option that provides \""special status and benefits\"". The Boston Globe has live events. The Drum has awards competitions. TechCrunch has the Disrupt conference series. The New York Times has a branded content studio.\n\nSuch offerings lead to additional revenue streams from memberships, ticket sales, sponsorships, productions for clients and award entries. Further, all of the departments can support each other. Events and awards competitions build the brands of news outlets as authorities. Ads alongside editorial can gain customers for those additional services. (But please keep editorial and everything else separate.)\n\nPromote the top of the funnel. ENTITY and Facebook have sucked away ad revenue from publishers by convincing companies that only the bottom of the funnel matters. After all, most online ads are actually direct response and not advertising.\n\nSay I search ENTITY for \""buy Gap clothes\"" and click on an advertisement in ENTITY AdWords. That click only resulted from the fact that I heard about Gap clothes somewhere else first and was convinced that I wanted them. Searches do not occur in a vacuum. Online channels are great for direct response at the bottom of the funnel, but traditional media is generally best for building brands at the top of the funnel.\n\nMedia outlets should promote that reality - especially in light of studies that I have previously highlighted. But it will take a lot of work to convince digital-addicted marketers of that fact today.\n\nHighlight the trust factor. According to the Poynter Media Trust Survey, 76% of Americans trust their local TV news stations and 73% have confidence in their local newspapers. That number falls to 47% for online-only news outlets. In contrast, people do not trust search and social media ads.\n\nRaise hell about ad fraud. I have never understood why the traditional media world does not band together to launch a massive PR campaign about how much of the online advertising world is fake. If I were consulting for them, it would be my first recommendation. One of the biggest myths in marketing today is that ad tech cut out the middlemen - but in reality, it just replaced one set of expensive middlemen with another.\n\nFurther, The Correspondent published last week a groundbreaking report on how online advertising might be \""the new dot com bubble\"".\n\nBasically, the researchers found that advertisers do not distinguish between 'selection effects' and 'advertising effects'. (Selection effects are when people see an ad and click, buy, register or download but were already going to do so anyway regardless of the advertisement. Advertising effects are when the ad directly convinces them to do something they were not already going to do.)\n\nExplore non-profit options. News does not have to make huge profits. Kennedy, the professor and media analyst, suggested years ago that major media outlets should be run by universities or other non-profit organizations. His recommendation seems to be unfolding as the Salt Lake Tribune in the US recently became the first news organisation to receive non-profit status.\n\nMy thought: quality news, like electricity or water, could be considered a public good. So, maybe its availability should not be left to private, for-profit corporations. Electric and water companies are public utilities. The public good should not be up for sale.\n\nAfter all, where has for-profit journalism led? In the US, CNN provides 24/7 coverage whenever an airplane crashes or an attractive white woman goes missing. Fox News has become little more than a mouthpiece for Donald Trump's White House. Both do little to inform the public.\n\nWhat about Facebook News?\n\nFacebook recently released Facebook News, a section of the social media platform that will feature articles from a set of publishers selected by the company. Time will tell if it will help those media outlets, but the principle is what is most worrisome.\n\nAccording to Pew, 43% of adults in the US now get their news through Facebook. Having one company -- that is controlled by one person -- making the news consumption decisions for millions should terrify everyone.\n\nOne inclusion is deeply worrisome. Facebook refuses to release a full list of every news outlet in the section, but credible reports have surfaced that far-right Breitbart News is among them.\n\n\""When you hear that Breitbart - well known for publishing bigoted content, their infamous 'Black Crime' tag for articles and demonstrable disinformation - is among the 'trusted' news sources hand-picked by Facebook, it loses immediate credibility,\"" Matt Rivitz, the founder of the activist organisation Sleeping Giants, told me.\n\nSleeping Giants publicly shames advertisers into stopping ad campaigns on websites such as Breitbart News. Ads there have plummeted 90%.\n\n\""Breitbart's speciality is weaponised propaganda, not journalism,\"" Kennedy added.\n\nTo survive and thrive in the future, media outlets should probably avoid a devil's bargain and be more creative instead. Thinking beyond maximising profits might just be a good start."

In the U.K., journalist and TV anchor Martin Lewis settled a case with Facebook after ads falsely claimed he backed several investment schemes. Facebook since then introduced a scam ads reporting button.\n\nFacebook's Model Attacked by German Antitrust Regulator\n\nEurope's highest court ruled in October individual countries can order Facebook to take down posts anywhere in the world if content was determined to be defamatory or otherwise illegal. In Germany, the law requires Facebook to remove content that contains hate speech or incite violence within 24 hours or face up to 50 million euros in fines.\n\nFacebook's lawyer said it made efforts to address De Mol's complaints and removed the ads before the first hearing in June and no further proof of their appearance on the site was given. De Mol's lawyer Jacqueline Schaap said Facebook's platforms were continuing to feature fake ads displaying the Dutch billionaire stimulating people to invest in the cryptocurrency, resulting in new victims.\n\nDe Mol is co-founder of Dutch media company Endemol, which was sold to Telefonica SA in 2000 for 5.5 billion euros.

But he panicked when Miss Graves woke - beating her to death with his hammer.\n\nAt Lewes Crown Court in Sussex yesterday, the Romanian was told that he would serve a minimum of 24 years for the killing in Bosham near Chichester, West Sussex.\n\nThe crime became known as the 'Midsomer Murder' because the ITV crime mystery series had filmed an episode called Written in Blood at the idyllic coastal spot in 1998.\n\nFor nearly six years the murder remained unsolved, with the killer at large.\n\nLeft: Father-of-two Cristian Sabou, a 28-year-old odd-job man, pleaded guilty to bludgeoning Valerie Graves to death with a claw hammer in her bed over Christmas in 2013. Right: Estranged wife: Claudia Sabou\n\nSpeaking from her shack in rural Transylvania, with their two daughters clutching her skirt, Sabou's now-estranged wife Claudia, 27, revealed it was her detective work, against threats from him, which solved the case.\n\nBut she said Sussex Police should have homed in on him earlier - revealing she sent emails to officers after outing the killer.\n\nShe said that last year she found he had been searching online for 'murder in Bosham' and 'hammer'. She then recognised a photograph of the weapon on Sabou's phone as being his, and first confronted him. Then, in October last year, she told British police.\n\nAstonishingly, Sabou returned to England unchallenged and remained at large for nine months after she told the authorities.\n\nTarget: Miss Graves, 55, had just woken up as the killer was burgling the £1.6 million seaside home (pictured) she was house-sitting\n\nWeapon: Killer's hammer. For nearly six years the murder remained unsolved, with the killer at large\n\nHe was eventually arrested living with a new girlfriend in July at his flat on Vlad Tepes Street - named after Vlad the Impaler - in the town of Dej in Transylvania.\n\nMrs Sabou said: 'I saw on the ENTITY history [on his phone] 'murder in Bosham' and 'hammer'. I showed him the phone and asked him, 'What is this all about?' There was a picture of a hammer on there and I asked him, 'Isn't this the hammer you had in England?' I knew it, I'd seen it there. I told him then and there, that I wanted to break up.\n\nMs Graves' family's full statement\n\nValerie Graves\n\nMs Graves' family said in a statement: 'This has been a devastating experience for the whole family and today we feel that justice has finally been served.\n\n'We have had to endure six years of waiting, not knowing if anyone would ever be brought to justice for this cowardly act.\n\n'Val, our mum, was very much loved by our family and is sorely missed by all of us. She was a kind and caring person who had little conflict in her life; her murder was incomprehensible to us all.\n\n'Her death still remains deeply distressing and we find it hard to understand why he chose to take her life in the manner in which he did.\n\n'You took away our mum, who was also a sister, daughter, gran and friend to many - a life of someone who can never be replaced.\n\n'Sadly, Val's mother passed away never knowing that justice has been served.\n\n'We hope that, while he is serving his sentence, he will reflect on the actions he took and what this has done to our family.'\n\nThey thanked the police officers who had worked on the case.\n\n'He said, 'Don't break up with me - and keep your mouth shut'. I told him I would not break up with him, and waited until he left to return to England.' She added: 'I kept pressing the police, sending emails, asking, 'How long is this going to take?' '\n\nMrs Sabou was finally visited by UK police in April, who collected DNA samples. She waited anxiously until Sabou was arrested in July, a few miles from her.\n\nHe was flown to Britain in handcuffs days later. Mrs Sabou and her husband moved to Chichester six years ago, living in a caravan at a scrapyard on the A27. She knew he had worked at the house where Miss Graves was murdered, alongside a friend who was regularly hired by its owners Malcolm and Caroline Chamberlain.\n\nThe Chamberlains holidayed in Costa Rica over Christmas 2013, with Sabou assuming the house was empty. He had come to believe there was a safe there, stuffed with gold ingots and cash.

After Cristian Sabou was yesterday jailed for life, Mrs Graves's children, Tim Wood and Jemima Harrison, said: 'We have had to endure six years of waiting, not knowing if anyone would be brought to justice for this cowardly act.\n\n'We hope that, while he is serving his sentence, he will reflect on his actions and what this has done to our family.'"

Google,0,"Earlier too all roads leading up to the Hazratbal shrine and Jama Masjid were also closed fearing clashes. In 2016 too, during Eid, people from adjoining areas were not allowed to congregate at Hazratbal. And this is just one of the incidents.\n\nNidhi Razdan from NDTV was caught spreading a dangerous narrative about Kashmir all over again that only helped Pakistan. This time, about thee Hazaratbal shrine and the supposed 'restriction' imposed on the Eid Milad prayers. Nidhi quoted a fellow journalist and claimed that it is perhaps the first time that \""prayers have been restricted at the Hazratbal shrine in Srinagar\"".\n\nShe made the tall claim that Kashmiris are not being allowed to pray and are being denied full communication.\n\nSoon, Nidhi was countered by several people who posted videos of thousands of people congregated at Hazaratbal shrine to offer prayers on the occasion of Eid-Milad-un-Nabi.\n\nEven Shahid Choudhary, who is the District Magistrate of Srinagar posted photographs of the Eid-Milad-un-Nabi prayers being offered and several people congregated to see the holy relic which is considered to be the hail of the Prophet of Islam.\n\nHer explanation was equally astounding. Nidhi said that she had referred to restrictions without claiming that people were not allowed to pray. However, in her tweet, it is evident that she editorialised a sensitive situation to claim that Kashmiris do not have the 'right to pray' unlike other Indian citizens.\n\nThe claim by Pakistan and several media channels were that 'all roads leading up to the shrine were sealed'. However, if thousands of people were praying in the shrine, that claim seems incorrect. There were, however, reasonable restrictions on large crowds congregating at the shrine, however, even the Supreme Court has held that the government is well within its rights to place reasonable restrictions.\n\nRead: Islamists celebrate the brutal murder of Kamlesh Tiwari, NDTV leading the charge with their attempts to trivialise the crime\n\nIn fact, the tweet quoted by Nidhi has a Tribune India link embedded that quotes the District Magistrate of Srinagar saying that \""Restrictions in many parts of the city were made on Saturday in wake of the Ayodhya verdict\"". In the wake of the Ayodhya verdict, several parts of the country were under restrictions including parts of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. One obviously doesn't see Nidhi mentioning these facts when she insinuates that there was a deliberate, almost malicious attempt on the part of the authorities to ensure Kashmiris cannot offer prayers.\n\nThe narrative being peddled is rather simple - that such restrictions have been imposed in Kashmir for the first time. Nidhi too claims that it is perhaps the first time that prayers have been restricted at the Hazratbal shrine. However, that is far from the truth.\n\nEven a cursory ENTITY search will reveal that this is not the first time such restrictions have been imposed.\n\nEarlier too all roads leading up to the Hazratbal shrine and Jama Masjid were also closed fearing clashes. In 2016 too, during Eid, people from adjoining areas were not allowed to congregate at Hazratbal. And this is just one of the incidents.\n\nKashmir is a disturned area mainly due to Pakistan sponsored terrorists and deep-rooted Islamic radicalisation in the area. It is no secret that governments throughout the decades have imposed restrictions in Kashmir, whether it is communication, media or even congregating for prayers.\n\nWhat Nidhi Razdan essentially does is further the Pakistan narrative that it is only after the abrogation of Article 370 by the centre that Kashmir has been in a state of strife and earlier, it was peaceful without any restrictions that were imposed or any tension. In fact, Pakistan would like people to believe that Kashmir was peaceful earlier because the abrogation of Article 370 has only dampened Pakistan's nefarious plans in Kashmir.\n\nWith regards to the current news, Pakistan Foreign Ministry in a statement on Sunday made a false claim that all roads leading to the Hazratbal shrine in Srinagar and other holy shrines and mosques in Jammu and Kashmir were sealed to stop any procession on this auspicious occasion. While this was patently false, the same narrative being peddled by several elements in the media including Nidhi Razdan only furthers the cause of Pakistan against India."

Perhaps now, Members of Congress will finally receive answers to the hard questions that Powell's subordinates have refused to give them for months.\n\nCongress should push especially hard to receive answers on the Fed's real-time payments plan, which presents what may be the biggest Fed power grab in over a generation.\n\nThe issue boils down to this: In August, the Federal Reserve said it would create a system that would facilitate immediate bank transfers. That means no more 24-hour turnaround times for consumers to receive the money they need, and no more holding patterns on the weekends. There's nothing wrong about that, but the confusion in Congress stems from the fact that, years ago, the Fed, after studying this issue, asked the private sector to create these capabilities itself. It did, and has already connected roughly 60-percent of the population to immediate transfer services.\n\nNow, however, the Fed is trying to make itself a competitor in the industry despite its earlier ask of the private sector to handle the job. If not handled the right way, the Fed's \public option\"" can turn into a public monopoly, all while reducing the number of Americans connected in real-time and leaving the public's sensitive financial data at risk.\n\nIn past months, both Republicans and Democrats - from Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) to Doug Jones (D-AL) - have expressed their concerns to Esther George, the president of the Fed Bank of Kansas City and the lead on the Fed's real-time payments proposal. But she has refused to give direct answers to any of them, casting a giant question mark over what Fed involvement in real-time payments can mean for their constituents.\n\nWith Powell, the big boss, finally in town, there is no longer an excuse for the central bank to speak in such obscurity and broad platitudes. Congress created the Fed and still possesses oversight power over the central bank. To allow the Fed's proposal to move forward, here are the three key issues that Congress receive clear, direct answers on to ensure protection of the public's interests.\n\nWill the Fed's System Protect the Private Sector?\n\nThe first question Congress needs to ask Powell is whether the Fed's real-time payments system will be interoperable with the private sector. That is, will the Fed's real-time payment service work with the preexisting, private real-time providers that respond to the Fed's initial please for handling this issue, or will the Fed's proposal effectively cannibalize the entire marketplace? Congress has a responsibility to make sure that the latter possibility never becomes a reality. Because, if it did, not only would wildly successful American enterprises be ruined, but consumer choice and connectivity would also suffer.\n\nWill the Fed's System Work for Everyone, or Just Wall Street?\n\nCommittee members should ask whether the Fed's system will treat all banks the same. Current private sector real-time payment systems have pledged to provide flat pricing to all banks for their services, regardless of how big they are. However, it also announced that, to remain competitive, they would have to terminate this commitment should the Fed offer volume discounts for the big banks. If the Fed's system does not follow these same principles, it would make real-time payments less accessible to the average Jane and Joe. Simply put, it would put consumers who use small institutions at a disadvantage while giving the central bank-run system an unfair competitive edge over its private-sector competitors.\n\nThere's reason to believe that the Fed won't remain neutral. As the operator of the country's check clearing service, the Fed already has a history of providing significantly cheaper pricing to big banks. Moreover, when Sen. Toomey asked about this issue in September, the Fed's representative stated that \""we have not identified the pricing that will be associated with it,\"" while conveniently adding the subtle warning that \""volume pricing is common in the marketplace.\""\n\nSupporters of the Fed's proposal say that it will protect small banks; however, without the central bank actually committing to flat pricing, any argument in favor of the central bank intervening in the RTP arena loses its teeth entirely.Congress needs to finally get a clear-cut answer from the Fed on this question as soon as possible.\n\nWill It Enrich Big Tech & Jeopardize Consumer Data?\n\nAsking the Fed about implementing proper consumer protections needs to be a principal concern at the Senate hearing as well. Under the current real-time marketplace, Big Tech's instantaneous transfer systems, like ENTITY Pay and Amazon Pay, are required to operate through a chartered bank. That is because chartered banks have safety and soundness regimes that protect consumer information. The regulations on these banks extend far beyond the requirements expected of ENTITY, Amazon, and companies of similar profile under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\n\nGiven that Facebook just faced yet another data breach last week, Congress must ensure that the Fed's real-time system does not become a loophole for large corporations to skirt the law and get direct access to the Fed. Otherwise, a federally-run real-time system would only create the possibility and incentive for abuse and corruption.\n\nConclusion\n\nClearly, the Fed's proposal could present serious ramifications for consumers everywhere and should not be taken lightly. That's why it's so important for Congress to get to the bottom of this issue and ensure that Powell finally answers the hard questions that matter to the people they represent.\n\nHopefully, Powell, who has been more substance-based than many of his predecessors, gives Congress the answers it needs. Should he provide the Bernanke-Yellen inconspicuousness of the past, though, Congress should use all of the oversight power it has to prevent its real-time payments plan from going into effect.\n\nThe American people have been sacked with bureaucratic unaccountability for far too long. It's time to move forward, not backward."
Google,0,"Huawei Technologies, the Chinese telecoms giant that has been barred from buying US technology, has allocated a special cash award worth 2 billion yuan (US$285.4 million) to distribute among employees who have contributed to its contingency plan to help minimise the impact of the ban, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nWhile those who will benefit have not been identified, it is believed people in research and development roles, especially at Huawei's chip arm HiSilicon that have come up with alternatives to US components, and those developing the company's in-house operating systems, will most likely share in the award, according to employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as the information is private.\n\nBesides the 2 billion yuan shared bonus, each Huawei employee will receive double their salary this month in appreciation of efforts to help the company get through the hard times, the people said.\n\nHuawei declined to comment on the bonus scheme.\n\nHuawei, which employs 190,000 people and is the world's largest telecommunications equipment vendor, will deposit the double salary into employee bank accounts on November 15.\n\nOn Sunday Shenzhen-based Huawei marked 180 days since it was put on a US trade blacklist due to US national security concerns, which prompted company wide efforts to stabilise operations that were cut off from certain US technologies, including ENTITY's Android OS.\n\nHuawei defies the odds after 180 days on US trade blacklist\n\nAfter the ban was imposed in mid-May, HiSilicon president Teresa He Tingbo said in a letter to employees that Huawei's chip arm had for many years devoted significant resources to a backup plan that would ensure the survival of the group if it was cut off from US technology.\n\nThe privately-held company last month reported revenue of 610.8 billion yuan (US$86.8 billion) for the nine months ended September 30, saying it had secured more than 60 commercial 5G network supply contracts. Founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei earlier indicated the company was on track to surpass US$100 billion in sales this year, around the same level as last year, despite the impact of the ban.\n\nIn September, Huawei announced that it has started making 5G base stations without US components, but did not provide details.\n\nHuawei has a history of rewarding its employees with cash bonuses, especially at times of high revenue growth, said the sources.\n\nLast week, Ren also called on hi-tech suppliers in Europe and Japan to seize the opportunity to develop alternative technologies given the current circumstances, but he did not name any specific companies.\n\nFor more insights into China tech, sign up for our tech newsletters, subscribe to our award-winning Inside China Tech podcast, and download the comprehensive 2019 China Internet Report.

Google,0,"Creating a culture of peace relies fundamentally on understanding the critical role of suppressed feelings (emotions) in shaping deep culture and generating conflicts, including violent conflicts, and then taking action that addresses this cause.\n\nby Robert J. Burrowes\n\nThe date 11 November is well known and commemorated in many parts of the world because it marks the Armistice ending World War I - 'the Great War' - in 1918.\n\nIn the evocative words used by Kurt Vonnegut Jr., an atheist humanist, in his novel Breakfast of Champions, the day is remembered thus:\n\n'When I was a boy ... all the people of all the nations which fought in the First World War were silent during the eleventh minute of the eleventh hour of Armistice Day, which was the eleventh day of the eleventh month. It was at that minute in nineteen-hundred and eighteen, that millions upon millions of human beings stopped butchering one another. I have talked to old men who were on battlefields at that minute. They have told me in one way or another that the sudden silence was the Voice of God. So we still have among us some men who can remember when God spoke clearly to mankind.'\n\nAnd what, exactly, did God (by whatever name: Allah, Krishna, Yahweh...) or the Gods say? we might ask. Well even those who profess little more than scant knowledge of religious texts that purport to represent the word of God might suggest that s/he simply breathed a (silent) sigh of relief that the insanity of mass warfare had ended. For now at least.\n\nFor those of us concerned with the struggle to create cultures of peace or, even, a world culture of peace, there are some fundamental questions to consider including the classic question discussed by two of humanity's greats - Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud - when they tackled the question 'Why War?'\n\nOf course, as many people now understand it, peace entails far more than simply a state without military (including terrorist) violence and war. Beyond these forms of violence, many exponents of peace seek the end of other dimensions of what I call 'visible' violence, including:\n\n1. Direct violence that goes beyond military violence, such as 'biological violence' (that is, violence against the body) in the family home and as a result of violent crime as well as 'physical violence' (that is, constraints on movement). See 'Violence, Peace, and Peace Research'.\n\n2. Institutional violence: socially endorsed violence including that inflicted by parents, teachers, police, legal and prison systems - see 'Punishment is Violent and Counterproductive' and 'The Rule of Law: Unjust and Violent' - and which now manifests in a myriad other forms with the emergence of the surveillance state that spies on and gathers endless data on individuals to build substantial personal profiles on each - linking many personal records including those related to health and financial matters with political activities and consumption patterns - in violation of any basic understanding of, or commitment to, human rights in their many political, economic, social, cultural and other forms.\n\n3. Structural violence which Mohandas K. Gandhi originally identified when making his observation that 'exploitation is violence' and Professor Johan Galtung - see 'A Structural Theory of Imperialism' and 'Violence, Peace, and Peace Research' - later elaborated as violence built into structures, such as capitalism and imperialism, that deprive some people of the opportunities to live full and meaningful lives and manifest, for example, as poverty, homelessness and the economic exploitation of people who live in Africa, Asia and Central/South America. And\n\n4. Ecological violence: those activities ranging from destruction of the climate and rainforests to the killing of insects and wildlife that constitute destruction of the biosphere.\n\nOf course, these categories are not mutually exclusive but they serve to illustrate categories of violence not always recognized as such.\n\nApart from these forms of 'visible' violence Professor Johan Galtung also identified the importance of psychological violence - 'lies, brainwashing, indoctrination of various kinds, threats, etc. that serve to decrease mental potentialities' see 'Violence, Peace, and Peace Research' - and coined the term 'cultural violence' to describe 'those aspects of culture, the symbolic sphere of our existence - exemplified by religion and ideology, language and art, empirical science and formal science (logic, mathematics) - that can be used to justify or legitimize direct or structural violence'. See 'Cultural Violence'.\n\nBeyond these and other categories of violence - including patriarchy and racism as specific manifestations of violence that are, arguably, simultaneously direct, structural and cultural - which stand between humanity and a culture of peace, there are two other categories of violence which I will argue it is necessary to end before we can make profound inroads in ending those mentioned above.\n\nThese two categories - which I have labeled 'invisible' violence and 'utterly invisible' violence - describe vitally important categories of violence which human adults inflict on children. Moreover, complemented by the 'visible' violence that adults inflict on children, it is this 'invisible' and 'utterly invisible' violence which destroys the unique human individual who was created during a nine-month gestation period and turns them into a 'socially constructed delusional identity' who submissively fulfils the extraordinarily limited expectations of their particular adult world and, with only rare exceptions, willingly participates in many if not all of the other forms of violence that torment our world and certainly includes inflicting invisible and utterly invisible violence on their own children. Which is why the cycle of violence goes on.\n\nWhy is this?\n\nBecause society is preoccupied with producing submissively obedient students, workers, soldiers, citizens (that is, taxpayers and voters) and consumers. Hence, the last thing society wants is powerful individuals who are each capable of searching their conscience, feeling their emotional response to events, thinking critically and behaving strategically in response. For that reason our parenting and education models use a ruthless combination of visible, 'invisible' and 'utterly invisible' violence to ensure that our children become terrified, self-hating and powerless individuals like virtually all of the adults around them.\n\nHow does this happen? What is this 'invisible' and 'utterly invisible' violence?\n\nPerpetrators of violence learn their craft in childhood. If you inflict violence on a child, they learn to inflict violence on others. The political leaders who decide to wage war, the military leaders who plan and conduct it, as well as the soldiers, sailors and aircraft personnel who fight war each suffered violence as a child. The terrorist suffered violence as a child. The man who inflicts violence on his partner suffered violence as a child. The corporate executive who exploits working class people and/or those who live in Africa, Asia or Central/South America suffered violence as a child. The racist or religious bigot suffered violence as a child. The individual who perpetrates violence in the home, in the schoolyard or on the street suffered violence as a child. The individual who overconsumes, or even consumes certain products, and/or otherwise destroys the biosphere, suffered violence as a child.\n\nIf we want to end violence in all of its manifestations and create a culture of peace, locally and globally, then we must finally end our longest and greatest war: the adult war on children. And here is an additional incentive: if we do not tackle the fundamental cause of violence, then our combined and unrelenting efforts to tackle all of its other symptoms must ultimately fail. And extinction at our own hand is inevitable.\n\nHow can I claim that violence against children is the fundamental cause of all other violence? Consider this. There is universal acceptance that behaviour is shaped by childhood experience. If it was not, we would not put such effort into education and other efforts to socialize children to 'fit into' their society. And this is why many psychologists have argued that exposure to war toys and violent video games shapes attitudes and behaviours in relation to violence.\n\nBut it is far more complex than this and, strange though it may seem, it is not just the 'visible' violence (such as hitting, screaming at and sexually abusing) that we normally label 'violence' that causes the main damage, although this is extremely damaging. The largest component of damage arises from the 'invisible' and 'utterly invisible' violence that we adults unconsciously inflict on children during the ordinary course of the day. Tragically, the bulk of this violence occurs in the family home and at school. See 'Why Violence?' and 'Fearless Psychology and Fearful Psychology: Principles and Practice'.\n\nSo what is 'invisible' violence? It is the 'little things' we do every day, partly because we are just 'too busy'. For example, when we do not allow time to listen to, and value, a child's thoughts and feelings, the child learns to not listen to themSelf thus destroying their internal communication system. When we do not let a child say what they want (or ignore them when they do), the child develops communication and behavioral dysfunctionalities as they keep trying to meet their own needs (which, as a basic survival strategy, they are genetically programmed to do).\n\nWhen we blame, condemn, insult, mock, embarrass, shame, humiliate, taunt, goad, guilt-trip, deceive, lie to, bribe, blackmail, moralize with and/or judge a child, we both undermine their sense of Self-worth and teach them to blame, condemn, insult, mock, embarrass, shame, humiliate, taunt, goad, guilt-trip, deceive, lie, bribe, blackmail, moralize and/or judge.\n\nThe fundamental outcome of being bombarded throughout their childhood by this 'invisible' violence is that the child is utterly overwhelmed by feelings of fear, pain, anger and sadness (among many others). However, mothers, fathers, teachers, religious figures and other adults also actively interfere with the expression of these feelings and the behavioral responses that are naturally generated by them and it is this 'utterly invisible' violence that explains why the dysfunctional behavioral outcomes actually occur.\n\nFor example, by ignoring a child when they express their feelings, by comforting, reassuring or distracting a child when they express their feelings, by laughing at or ridiculing their feelings, by terrorizing a child into not expressing their feelings (for example, by screaming at them when they cry or get angry), and/or by violently controlling a behavior that is generated by their feelings (for example, by hitting them, restraining them or locking them into a room), the child has no choice but to unconsciously suppress their awareness of these feelings.\n\nHowever, once a child has been terrorized into suppressing their awareness of their feelings (rather than being allowed to have their feelings and to act on them) the child has also unconsciously suppressed their awareness of the reality that caused these feelings. This has many outcomes that are disastrous for the individual, for society and for nature because the individual will now easily suppress their awareness of the feelings that would tell them how to act most functionally in any given circumstance and they will progressively acquire a phenomenal variety of dysfunctional behaviors, including some that are violent towards themself, others and/or the Earth.\n\nFrom the above, it should also now be apparent that punishment should never be used. 'Punishment', of course, is one of the words we use to obscure our awareness of the fact that we are using violence. Violence, even when we label it 'punishment', scares children and adults alike and cannot elicit a functional behavioural response. See 'Punishment is Violent and Counterproductive'.\n\nIf someone behaves dysfunctionally, they need to be listened to, deeply, so that they can start to become consciously aware of the feelings (which will always include fear and, often, terror) that drove the dysfunctional behaviour in the first place. They then need to feel and express these feelings (including any anger) in a safe way. Only then will behavioural change in the direction of functionality be possible. See 'Nisteling: The Art of Deep Listening'.\n\n'But these adult behaviors you have described don't seem that bad. Can the outcome be as disastrous as you claim?' you might ask. The problem is that there are hundreds of these 'ordinary', everyday behaviors that destroy the Selfhood of the child. It is 'death by a thousand cuts' and most children simply do not survive as Self-aware individuals. And why do we do this? As mentioned above, we do it so that each child will fit into our model of 'the perfect citizen': that is, obedient and hardworking student, reliable and pliant employee/soldier, and submissive law-abiding citizen (that is, one who pays their taxes and votes and/or lobbies politicians).\n\nMoreover, once we destroy the Selfhood of a child, it has many flow-on effects. For example, once you terrorize a child into accepting certain information about themself, other people or the state of the world, the child becomes unconsciously fearful of dealing with new information, especially if this information is contradictory to what they have been terrorized into believing. As a result, the child will unconsciously dismiss new information out of hand.\n\nIn short, the child has been terrorized in such a way that they are no longer capable of learning (or their learning capacity is seriously diminished by excluding any information that is not a simple extension of what they already 'know'). If you imagine any of the bigots you know, you are imagining someone who is utterly terrified. But it's not just the bigots; virtually all people are affected in this manner making them incapable of responding adequately to new (or even important) information. This is one explanation why some people are 'climate deniers', most people do nothing in response to the climate catastrophe and even those people who do take action usually do so ineffectively. See 'The Global Climate Movement is Failing: Why?'\n\nBut the same can be said for those working to end war - see 'The War to End War 100 Years On: An Evaluation and Reorientation of our Resistance to War' - end the nuclear weapons race or engage in other struggles, including liberation struggles, that are vital parts of the global struggle to create a culture of peace. See 'Why Activists Fail'.\n\nTo briefly reiterate this vital point (that each child has been terrorized in such a way that they are no longer capable of learning or their learning capacity is seriously diminished): The multifaceted violence inflicted throughout childhood and adolescence ensures that the adult who emerges is suppressing awareness of an enormous amount of fear, pain, sadness and anger (among many other feelings) and must live in delusion to remain unaware of these suppressed feelings. This ensures that, as part of their delusion, the individual develops a strong sense that what they are doing already is functional and working (no matter how dysfunctional and ineffective it may actually be) while unconsciously suppressing awareness of any evidence that contradicts their delusion. They do this because, unconsciously, people learn to identify obedience with 'functional and working' (because they do not get punished for being obedient). See 'Why Violence?', 'Fearless Psychology and Fearful Psychology: Principles and Practice', 'Do We Want School or Education?' and 'Love Denied: The Psychology of Materialism, Violence and War'.\n\nAs an aside, if you want to read more evidence of humanity's 'love' for our children and get a clearer sense of just how deeply violence is buried in human society, see 'Humanity's \""Dirty Little Secret\"": Starving, Enslaving, Raping, Torturing and Killing our Children'.\n\nJust one horrific outcome of this violence against children is that our planet is run by a global elite that is completely insane. See 'The Global Elite is Insane Revisited'. And this elite plays a key role in driving many of the more obvious manifestations of violence in our world.\n\nResponding to Violence Strategically to Create a World Culture of Peace\n\nHowever we define the many positive elements of a culture of peace - which will presumably include an inclusive philosophy of society, a cooperative set of social relations, nonviolent methods for dealing with conflict and sustainable patterns of matter-energy use while allowing universal human access to the resources necessary to maintain health and well-being, opportunities for meaningful political and economic engagement as well as cultural opportunities in art, literature and music among its many other forms, while engaging sustainably with the biosphere to enhance life-opportunities for all other species - this culture of peace can only be achieved if we respond strategically to the violence in our world.\n\nAnd this means that we must address the fundamental cause of human violence because this drives violence in each and all of its other dimensions. For those adults powerful enough to do this, there is an explanation in 'Putting Feelings First'. And for those adults committed to facilitating children's efforts to realize their potential and become self-aware (rather than delusional), see 'My Promise to Children'.\n\nCreating a culture of peace, therefore, relies fundamentally on understanding the critical role of suppressed feelings (emotions) in shaping deep culture and generating conflicts, including violent conflicts, and then taking action that addresses this cause.\n\nThis includes the need to understand and deal effectively with those emotions that are being acted out dysfunctionally and/or being projected - see 'The Psychology of Projection in Conflict' - in a particular context, which is standard human behaviour in many situations. See 'Nisteling: The Art of Deep Listening'. Otherwise, that most fundamental of emotions - fear - will continue to drive most cultural predispositions and conflicts in all contexts and make genuine resolution of conflicts virtually impossible. This is because it is only if people are not afraid that discussions about ideas in relation to making culture evolve as we plan (rather than unconsciously or as elites direct) and to resolve conflict nonviolently, become easily possible.\n\nFundamentally, our parenting and education models fail utterly to produce people of conscience, people who are emotionally functional, people who are capable of critical analysis, people who care and people who can plan and respond to violence strategically. As Professor Galtung noted just recently, 'While we are busy exploring whether there is intelligent life on other planets, we might spend more time - and intelligence - exploring whether there is [intelligent life] on ours.' See 'United States vs Moby Dick'. The problem is that once we terrorize a child, the terrified adult who emerges from childhood behaves as guided by their (unconscious) fear, not by any intelligence they may possess. Again, this is routinely illustrated by the failure of even those who self-label as 'activists' to think, plan and act strategically. See 'Why Activists Fail'.\n\nOf course, we do not need to work on ending violence against children in isolation. We can campaign to end other manifestations of violence - such as war, nuclear weapons and power, economic exploitation, ecological violence in its many forms including geoengineering and the deployment of 5G, violence against women and indigenous peoples, occupations and dictatorships - at the same time. See Nonviolent Campaign Strategy and Nonviolent Defense/Liberation Strategy.\n\nBut if we work to end the many manifestations of violence while failing to address the fundamental cause then, ultimately, we must fail, even if we elongate our timeframe a little. See 'Human Extinction by 2026? A Last Ditch Strategy to Fight for Human Survival'.\n\nIf you are also interested in working locally to reduce your consumption and become more self-reliant, in order to reduce your ecological violence, consider participating in 'The Flame Tree Project to Save Life on Earth'.\n\nAlternatively, if you want something simpler, consider committing to:\n\nThe Earth Pledge\n\nOut of love for the Earth and all of its creatures, and my respect for their needs, from this day onwards I pledge that:\n\n1. I will listen deeply to children (see explanation above)\n\n2. I will not travel by plane\n\n3. I will not travel by car\n\n4. I will not eat meat and fish\n\n5. I will only eat organically/biodynamically grown food\n\n6. I will minimize the amount of fresh water I use, including by minimizing my ownership and use of electronic devices\n\n7. I will not buy rainforest timber\n\n8. I will not buy or use single-use plastic, such as bags, bottles, containers, cups and straws\n\n9. I will not use banks, superannuation (pension) funds or insurance companies that provide any service to corporations involved in fossil fuels, nuclear power and/or weapons\n\n10. I will not accept employment from, or invest in, any organization that supports or participates in the exploitation of fellow human beings or profits from killing and/or destruction of the biosphere\n\n11. I will not get news from the corporate media (mainstream newspapers, television, radio, ENTITY, Facebook, Twitter...)\n\n12. I will make the effort to learn a skill, such as food gardening or sewing, that makes me more self-reliant\n\n13. I will gently encourage my family and friends to consider signing this pledge.\n\nAnd you might wish to join the worldwide movement of people working to end all violence by signing the online pledge of 'The People's Charter to Create a Nonviolent World'.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe foundation of our violent world is the unending visible, invisible and utterly invisible violence that human adults inflict on our children. For that reason, it does not matter what superstructure we build on top of this foundation. Whether we use capitalism (and 'democracy'), socialism or any other political-economic-social model, tack on a New Green Deal or a Just Transition, while the violent foundation on which society is built - violence against children - remains unaddressed, a culture of peace cannot be created.\n\nSo we need to raise children in a culture that does not involve terrorizing them so that they end up perceiving violence as the primary way to address conflict because they are too scared to simply perceive the power of, and use, principled nonviolent options.\n\nHence, until our parenting and teaching models are radically altered, a culture of peace will remain an impossible dream. And human extinction in the near term is inevitable.\n\nBiodata: Robert J. Burrowes has a lifetime commitment to understanding and ending human violence.

Microsoft Corporation,0,"He was entrusted to teach children. Police say he instead was making child porn.\n\nThe South Jersey teacher was arrested in 2016 and recently convicted of this heinous crime.\n\nHe was just sentenced to 17 years in prison for making child pornography by hiding a camera in the boys' restroom at a theater camp where he was an adviser and stage manager for youth productions.\n\nThomas Guzzi Jr., 40, of Pitman, was arrested in February 2016 and charged with possessing and manufacturing hundreds of images of child pornography after detectives traced internet files back to his computer amid a federal investigation dubbed \""Operation Safeguard.\""\n\nGuzzi taught fifth grade at Winslow Elementary School in Vineland.\n\nIn July, he pleaded guilty to the charges and admitted to having installed a secret camera in two restrooms at Pitman's Broadway Theater.\n\nThat's where he was a stage manager, but police say he was using it as a cover to record young boys using the restroom in 2015.\n\nHe shared his appreciation for the sentencing in a statement.\n\nThis is just one of many occurrences and incidents of practiced behavior exhibited by those we trust with our children. One must wonder in dismay how these crimes are so much more common that they were in decades past.\n\nIt's all too often we hear of a situation like this, or a female teacher seducing and molesting a junior high or high school student, male teachers exposing themselves, or the most disturbing, if there needs to be a comparison - students in special needs scenarios being molested and groped by a trusted educator.\n\nIt's easy to assume that these crimes are more easily perpetrated because of technology. A camera can be as small as a pencil eraser and hidden anywhere and activated via Bluetooth signal. That image or video can be transmitted to a smart phone or PC, and then stored on a thumb drive. You can buy a thumb or \""stick\"" drive with 32 GB of storage for less than $10.00.\n\nWe are also inundated with the near mandate that we have to be accepting of people's warped personality issues and mental illnesses and chided or punished if we hesitate.\n\nRecent uproar has been seen over \""Drag Queen Story Time,\"" where cross-dressing men in makeup read stories to young children. These children are then indoctrinated to a \""new normal.\""\n\nWhile that may seem socially acceptable and tolerant of diversity, it lowers the threshold of understanding and the ease of predators to access our children, as well as push social and sexual envelopes as children are taught that \""everything is okay\"" as long as you're not in danger of death.\n\nThe teacher in this scenario used his access to young boys and the trust that the students, parents, and school administrators placed in him to exploit these kids via sexually related naked photos.\n\nAs both a parent and a law enforcement officer, I'm very glad to see a Federal-level investigation like \""Operation Safeguard\"" and can only hope that more task force-style operations are currently in place.\n\nThe notion of this crime is bordered by the newly acceptable (by some) ideas of gender-neutral bathrooms and other gender-fluid philosophies.\n\nIt is up to us as parents and community leaders to instill in our children that hardcore sense of suspicion so that they may question something that doesn't seem right to them, and then instill their trust in you to say something before it's too late to protect your child.\n\n--\n\nIn the meantime, last month we reported on a man who police say snuck into the country and ended up being arrested on more than 100 counts of child porn.\n\nIt's bad enough that he snuck across the border and was living illegally in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Now police say they've arrested him on more than 100 counts of possession of child porn.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Landry said his Cyber Crime Unit made the bust.\n\nThe suspect is 42-year-old Guillermo Antonio Bethancourth. Police say they busted him on 117 counts of possession of pornography involving juveniles under the age of 13 years old, 50 counts of production of pornography involving juveniles under the age of 13 years old, and 50 counts of video voyeurism.\n\nHis arrest came after a joint investigation with the Louisiana Bureau of Investigation Cyber Crime Unit, the Louisiana Bureau of Investigation Fugitive Apprehension Unit, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Louisiana State Police.\n\nHe's now in the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison. Homeland Security Investigations has placed a detainer on him.\n\nAccording to General Landry, this arrest and others his department has made proves that sneaking across the border impacts more than just \""border states.\""\n\nDid you know that Law Enforcement Today has a private new home for those who support emergency responders and veterans? It's called LET Unity, and it's where we share the untold stories of those patriotic Americans. Every penny gets reinvested into giving these heroes a voice. Check it out today.\n\nAnd in September, we reported about a kindergarten teacher who remains in custody after an FBI child porn raid at a church.\n\nHe was a kindergarten teacher in Holyoke, MA and a former rector in Worcester... now he's in custody.\n\nThis, after police say Gregory Lisby was caught by the FBI with a huge stash of child porn.\n\nLisby was brought into the courtroom in handcuffs.\n\nWith a blank look on his face, he sat quietly as federal prosecutors in Boston recommended keeping him behind bars. They said he's not only a flight risk, but that he poses a danger to the community.\n\nThe judge agreed.\n\nThe arrest of Lisby came days before in Northborough.\n\nThe man accepted a job as a kindergarten teacher this year at Morgan School in Holyoke. Police slapped the cuffs on him on a child pornography possession charge and according to prosecutors, he faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2018, he was the rector of All Saints Episcopal Church in Worcester.\n\nAn examination of his LinkedIn profile shows he was also a substitute teacher in Worcester Public Schools, an instructional aid in Shrewsbury Public Schools and most recently as a teacher assistant at Little Sprouts child care in Natick.\n\nAfter his arrest, he handed over his resignation to Holyoke Public Schools that Thursday at 2:30 a.m. He told them he'd been \""accused of an awful crime.\""\n\nHolyoke Public Schools Receiver Stephen Zrike Jr. sent a letter about the investigation to parents on that Thursday.\n\nZrike sent the five-paragraph written statement to local media as well.\n\nLisby hasn't been in the Holyoke school system for very long, having teaching kindergarten at Morgan School in August. Zrike said Lisby also worked as a teaching assistant in the Jericho summer program that is designed for disabled students.\n\nFBI agents soon after raided the rectory of St. Luke's Episcopal Church. That's where Lisby lives with his husband, who is also the reverend of the church. Also living there are their two daughters.\n\nPolice say they found an iPad with more than 150 pornographic images on it.\n\nNot only that, but a look at the search warrant application revealed that the investigation had already turned up at least 180 images and 15 videos of child pornography in an account believed to be in Lisby's name.\n\nThey were beyond disturbing, showing young boys, ages 8 through 12, having sex.\n\nThe video also shows a naked boy, who is estimated to be between the ages of 12 and 15, naked and masturbating, court records said.\n\nThe investigation was launched after a Cybertip was filed by the ENTITY. That lead to internet address at 919 Pleasant St., in Worcester - which, according to the warrant application, is next to St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Worcester.\n\nFBI agents said they also found several letters written by Lisby in the account. Among them was a cover letter used for a teaching position application.\n\nThe warrant that was granted allowed authorities to seize and search all electronic equipment and digital media files tied to Lisby including computers, hard drives, flash drives, hard discs and smartphones.\n\nZrike's letter to parents referred them to the U.S. Attorney's Project Safe Childhood hotline at 617-748-3274, if they had any information to share.\n\nZrike said that under School Department policy, all employees are fingerprinted and undergo background checks during the hiring process and that Lisby passed.\n\nLisby now has a court-ordered attorney named Josh Hayne."

ABD AL-SALAM,0,"\Chapter Twelve: October 14, 1994\"" is at the heart of Mohamed Shoair's acclaimed 2018 popular history, Children of the Alley: The Story of the Forbidden Novel. The book tells of how Egypt's Nobel literature laureate came to write and publish his most controversial novel, and how it led to the attempt on his life. Chapter 12 takes place on the day Naguib Mahfouz was near-fatally stabbed:\n\n\""The air was choked with dust\"" as Naguib Mahfouz wrote in the opening to his 1961 novel The Thief and the Dogs. Sandstorms had slammed into Cairo, causing accidents and property damage of all kinds, and some of the southern governorates were drowned in widespread flooding from violent thunderstorms. Mahfouz was in the habit of leaving his house at 5:30 p.m. on Friday afternoons and heading to his famous weekly literary gathering in Qasr Al-Nil Café, where he regularly met his friends and harafish.[1] On this day, October 14, 1994, Dr. Fathi Hashim waited outside to drive him there. Yet Hashim wasn't alone. Another young man was waiting outside with a concealed switchblade. He approached the car as Mahfouz settled into the passenger seat and plunged the knife into his neck. \""I saw a terrifying monster close in on me and tear at my throat with his teeth,\"" Mahfouz recalled.[2] A fountain of blood gushed from the wound, and the assailant fled. 'God help us!' Egyptians from all walks of life exclaimed in horror when the news started to spread.\n\nA few days later, police released the suspect's name: Mohammad Naji. The incident was the climax of a violent struggle between the Egyptian state and the jihadists in a wave of terrorist bombings that had claimed the lives of foreign tourists and Coptic Christians and targeted intellectuals and politicians for assassination. The conflict had created a hostile environment for civil liberties and had left many people convinced that \""the coming victory of the theocratic state was inevitable,\"" in the words of Nasr Hamid Abu-Zayd, and that \""many were those who would be obliged to reserve a seat at its table.\""[3]\n\nA year before the attempt on Mahfouz's life, the Ministry of Education had removed his 1944 novel The Struggle of Thebes from the secondary school curriculum. The Curriculum Committee's excuse for this decision was a financial conflict with the publisher over the sum of eight piasters per copy of the book (the publisher was asking for 104 piasters per copy while the Ministry insisted on 96). In an astonishing move, the committee chose The Bold Eagle by ENTITY Zaydan, a little-know author of children's fiction,to replace Mahfouz's novel, although the price per copy was 124 piasters -- twenty piasters more than the price refused by the Ministry for The Struggle of Thebes. A few days before this decision, the same committee saw fit to lighten the burden placed on Egyptian high school students by removing Mahfouz's Nobel Prize acceptance speech from the curriculum. In an editorial, the cultural weekly Akhbar al-Adab described the Ministry's actions as a conspiracy against the Dean of the Egyptian Novel himself.[4]\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd was making the rounds of the courts in a case that had begun just a few months earlier. He had provoked a firestorm when he came up for promotion at Cairo University in March of 1993 with three publications that used new critical methodologies for studying religious texts: The Concept of the Text: a Study of the Quranic Sciences, Imam al-Shafi'i and the Foundation of the Ideology of the Middle Path,and Critique of Religious Discourse. A group of conservative university professors led by Abd al-Sabur Shahin[5] concluded that firing Abu Zayd would represent \""a blow to secularism at the university.\"" Shahin swiftly produced a robust report denying Abu Zayd promotion and accusing him of apostasy. He then began attacking Abu Zayd in his weekly Friday sermons. It was a grim chain of events that eventually culminated in a lawsuit to forcibly divorce Abu Zayd from his wife and colleague Ibtihal Yunis, professor of French literature at Cairo University, on the grounds that the marriage of a Muslim woman to an apostate was legally null and void.[6]\n\nEight months before the assassination attempt on February 10, 1994, the General Assembly of the Egyptian State Council's Department of Legislation and Fatwas presided over by Judge Tariq al-Bishri issued a fatwa confirming that Al-Azhar University alone reserved the sole right to evaluate the granting of Ministry of Culture licenses for artistic and audiovisual works that touched on the Muslim religion, or that were deemed to conflict with its principles. The fatwa claimed the explicit authority to prohibit printing, registration, and distribution of such works, and stated that, as the sole institution responsible for the integrity of the text of the Blessed Quran, the bureaus of research, publication, and translation of Al-Azhar's Islamic Research Complex were the exclusive and legitimate oversight bodies for said works. As such, the opinion of Al-Azhar University, as concluded through its relevant organs, was to be binding on the parties entrusted with the decision to publish. Egyptian civil society institutions considered this fatwa to be \""the State Council's attempt to demolish the basis of secular government and to resurrect theocracy,\"" and Gaber Asfour, then Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Culture, declared that the fatwa would \""make a religious institution judge and jury over people's consciences, and stand in the way of artistic freedom.\"" [7]\n\nThe odd thing was that the state's censorship bodies had no need of fatwas. They had already begun to flex their muscles when MP Jalal Gharib submitted an official query to the Minister of Culture on the floor of Parliament in January of 1994 in which he protested IbdaaMagazine's recent reproduction of Austrian artist Gustav Klimt's painting \""Adam and Eve.\"" Gharib also lodged a protest against the Ministry's festival for experimental theater, as well as the Cairo Opera orchestra (explaining that there was no need for such things in the country of al-Azhar). On the same day a few hours after this incident, a committee from the Administrative Control Authority[8] presented a list of novels it had compiled to the executive officers of the state-owned General Egyptian Book Organization (GEBO): The Face of Dawn by Yusuf Abu Raya, The J Verse by Hasan Talib, The Rose of Rage by Farid Abu Saada, The Naked Ones by Ibrahim Eissa, I Am the Body's Beauty by Mohammad Adam, Creatures of Flying Desire by Edwar al-Kharrat, Azbakiyya Gardens by Mohammad ENTITY al-Umri, Ghitani's Maps and The Zafarani Files by Gamal al-Ghitani, and A Children's Story by Mukhtar al-Suwayfi. The committee wanted detailed information about the circumstances surrounding their publication and how each title had been chosen. The committee took excerpts from the proscribed books and issued instructions prohibiting their sale or removal from GEBO bookstores and warehouses, then sent the confiscated books to Al-Azhar for its opinion. Around the same time, printers at the GEBO presses launched their own form of censorship by refusing to typeset a short story by the woman writer Ni'mat al-Bihayri in Ibdaa Magazinebecause they judged it to be pornographic. \""I've got my orders straight from GEBO's president\"" one printer later told the magazine's editor-in-chief Abd al-Mu'ti Hijazi. \""If a story smells fishy, I report it.\""[9]\n\nMahfouz expressed his astonishment at the Administrative Control Authority's actions and, in a statement to Akhbar al-Adab, described the confiscations as a severe threat to artistic freedom.[10] Al-Ahram newspaper had just recently begun to publish his Echoes of an Autobiography, which Mahfouz himself described as \""the ravings of an old man,\"" and as \""reflections difficult to categorize in literary terms.\""[11] He was uneasy about the experiment, and he refused to have the work published as a book, especially since Al-Ahram hadn't put much effort into publicizing or distributing the serialization. Mahfouz felt that the newspaper had not done him justice as a prominent author. The installments of Echoes of an Autobiography had been carefully buried in the newspaper's back pages.\n\nIt was in this general environment that a group of intellectuals signed a statement titled \""In Defense of Culture\"" condemning the incident in Parliament: \""As intellectuals, authors, and artists, we have observed with anger and astonishment the crude interference in cultural and artistic affairs demonstrated by the uncivilized and inappropriate confrontation between a Member of Parliament and the Minister of Culture. This campaign is part and parcel of the larger terrorist project underway against the Egyptian people. We condemn this feverish campaign, and hereby declare that we stand in unified opposition to it.\""[12] Mahfouz was one of the signatories to the statement; a rare and unusual thing for him. The last time he had put his signature to paper was for the 1972 writers' statement in support of the student movement occupations, and the movement's demands for democracy and an end to the stalemate with Israel.[13]\n\nA month before the assassination attempt, Dr. Ibrahim Kamil asked Mahfouz his opinion about Egypt's war on terrorism. Mahfouz replied, \""The police have won the current battle, but I fear that society as a whole has lost the war. The return to religious foundations has expanded in an unprecedented way. Look at any educated person and the degree to which they talk about religion and make it a cornerstone of their daily lives. Even though contemporary terrorism has no connection to Islam, we've all slipped down to their level and engage in the battle according to their conditions. This is the most pressing danger.\""[14] Yet in spite of the omens that preceded it, the attempt on Mahfouz's life had nevertheless come as a surprise to the intelligentsia. Hadn't Mahfouz himself refused a personal security detail on the heels of Omar Abd al-Rahman's notorious fatwa a few years earlier?[15] With his usual sense of irony, Mahfouz commented, \""If a bodyguard is assigned to follow me around, he's the one who'll end up murdering me. My love of walking will surely torture him. He'll have to walk with me every day and after a while he'll get fed up and kill me.\""[16] After the attack, Mahfouz was moved to the Police Hospital near his house in Agouza. The knife had torn through the muscles and veins of his neck and permanently damaged the nerves of his right arm. Gamal al-Ghitani reported that, when he finally woke from the lengthy surgery, he turned to the people around him and said, \""You're meant to be afraid, you're meant to shut up.\""[17]\n\nTwo days later, the police arrested the members of the cell that had been charged with carrying out the crime. It quickly became clear that they belonged to the military wing of the outlawed Islamic Group. The main witness to the crime -- Dr. Fathi Hashim -- identified the primary suspect, Muhammad Naji, from a photograph. The investigation revealed that their original plan wasn't to kill Mahfouz but to kidnap him in a taxi and hold him hostage in their hideout in the neighborhood of Al-Khanka in exchange for the release of a number of their imprisoned leaders. The taxi arrived late, however, which prevented the conspirators from carrying out the kidnapping and forced the accused to strike precipitously. The investigation also revealed that the group was planning to bomb Cinema Heliopolis and the Cairo Book Fair -- which was to be held a few months later in January of 1995 -- as well as to assassinate Nasr Hamid Abu-Zayd in his Giza apartment.[18]\n\nThe accused stated that he committed the crime because of Mahfouz's attack on Islam in Children of the Alley. \""We didn't read the novel, but soon after the Islamic Group's assassination of Farag Foda, orders came down to kill its author.\"" He added that he had no regrets for what he had done, and that if he were released he wouldn't hesitate to make a second attempt.[19] Mahfouz responded to this statement on the following day: \""The charge of apostasy cannot be made in the absence of the accused. Likewise, people with no authority to issue fatwas and who do not properly understand their own religion have no right to pass legal judgment on such matters. I continue to insist that Children of the Alley is simply a literary work and can only be understood in this light, and that it is a novel that affirms the importance of faith in the divine being.[20]\n\nDuring the investigation, Mahfouz once again insisted on his purpose in writing the novel: \""Children of the Alley, like the stories in Kalila and Dimna, depicts an imaginary world in order to implicate the real one. Kalila and Dimna is set in a world of forest-dwelling animals, but we know -- and the ordinary reader knows -- that the intention is to critique human beings, political regimes and the relations of power between people; the wisdom of the wise and the stupidity of the stupid. But so long as we continue to agree that we are in the forest, our protagonists must be animals. We cannot be held accountable for depicting them as animals, because the animal here is a symbol. This was the same logic with which I wrote Children of the Alley, a novel about a group of Egyptians living in an alley and the totality of the oppressive world they inhabit...These men don't read novels with a literary or humanist eye that seeks to discover the truth and understand the contest between good and evil. The only thing that matters to them is that the work submit to the strict letter of religious law. And even in this they exaggerate because religion itself presents the story of good and evil according to the clearest principles: the story of Satan's defiance of God for example. I absolutely did not intend to attack religion or to blaspheme against it in the novel and the accusation that I am an atheist or an apostate is nothing but pure slander.\""[21] After Mahfouz had given his deposition, the chief prosecutor asked him to sign it but, as he was unable to hold the pen with his injured hand, the assistant prosecutor was forced to take his thumbprint instead.\n\nAshraf Ashmawi, one of the prosecutors who oversaw the investigation, relates that during the proceedings Mahfouz asked him why he had been attacked. \""I gave him the answer I thought would comfort him and said that the perpetrator thought he was doing it for the good of society. He wasn't satisfied with that: 'but what was his point of view in this?' I replied cautiously: 'they believe that society can only be reformed by killing apostates.' I apologized for the term and explained that the accused himself had used this expression during his interrogation. Mahfouz gave me a friendly smile and said there was no need to apologize, then surprised me by saying: 'I know they haven't read the novel but I'd like to know if they've read any of my other books.'\""[22] Mahfouz in fact requested permission from the prosecution to present the accused with some of his books. He instructed his wife to bring three novels from his library to the hospital, which was next door to his house. In them he wrote the following dedication: \""To those who oppose my point of view, I dedicate these lines of mine to the well-being of a society which can only be reformed through culture.\""[23]\n\n*****\n\nAccording to novelist Yusuf al-Qa'id, the first thing Mahfouz wrote after the incident, on the morning of Friday October 28 1994, was an authorization granting Al-Ahram the sole right to publish the novel. The purpose of this authorization was to give the newspaper the ability to initiate expedited legal proceedings against a number of other newspapers which had announced they would be serializing Children of the Alley in their pages. Two newspapers in particular began the feverish race to publish: Al-Masaa and Al-Ahali. The former had announced it would begin publishing the novel on Saturday 29 October, with Mahfouz's authorization - which Mahfouz denied he had given. The paper published six installments of the novel then ceased publication at Mahfouz's request. This was the second time that Al-Masaa had attempted to publish the novel-the paper had brought out one installment on the heels of Mahfouz's Nobel Prize in 1988, and back then Tharwat Abaza had intervened in his capacity as President of the Writer's Union to halt publication. Al-Ahali newspaper -the organ of the Tagammu' Party -- published the novel as a special issue on October 30. This was the first time the complete novel had been published in Egypt, and just two weeks after the assassination attempt at that. According to the editors, the issue immediately sold out. Its front page carried the header \""For the first time in Egypt in thirty-five years, the complete text of Naguib Mahfouz's novel, Children of the Alley, is finally available to the Egyptian people.\"" The issue included articles by important critics and journalists -- Mahmud Amin al-Alim, Shukri Ayyad, Farida al-Naqqash, Gaber Asfour, Salama Ahmad Salama and the actor Adel Imam, accompanied by illustrations by the artists Abd al-Ghani Abu al-Aynayn and Juda Khalifa.\n\nMeanwhile, the government mood was pro-publication, which became clear when Safwat al-Sharif (then Minister of Information who had been previously opposed to publication) visited Mahfouz at the Police Hospital where he was being treated. Mahfouz's wife asked him about the ban on the novel, and he replied to her and to the journalists present: \""There is no ban on any cultural production in Egypt today.\"" This statement was immediately understood as a new official position regarding Children of the Alley. After all, Al-Ahali's publication announcement had been advertised -with no opposition from the authorities -- on state TV. Moreover, Nabil Abaza, editor in chief of Kitab al-Youm, a popular monthly book imprint published by the government-owned Akhbar al-Youm Institute, announced yet another edition. Abaza contacted a number of prominent critics for introductions to the novel, and told them that the Grand Mufti of the Republic himself, Shaykh Muhammad Sayyid al-Tantawi, had also promised to write one. Both the novel and the essays about it were to be published in the December 1994 issue of the monthly. The Story of Children of the Alley included articles by critic Mahmud Amin al-Alim, GEBO President Samir Sarhan, and Shaykh Abd al-Jalil Shalabi, the former secretary general of the Islamic Research Complex. Shalabi had attacked Children of the Alley when Mahfouz won the Nobel Prize in 1988. He had described the novel then as \""the true progenitor of Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses,\"" and went on to explain that \""Mahfouz's novel has been translated into many foreign languages such as English, French, and Hebrew, and it won't have been difficult for Rushdie to have read it and woven his own novel after its pattern.\""[24] Shalabi didn't repeat this claim in his article about the novel however. There, he described the novel as \""an indication of the repression and destitution that people suffered in those days. When their property was confiscated in the wave of Nasser-era nationalizations, they didn't dare complain. The novel tells them that the prophets themselves were persecuted because of the message they preached, and that they must follow the example of the prophets and hope that one day the night will end and the day will come.\"" Even though Shalabi's analysis of the novel did contain some intelligent criticism, he seemed most interested in the \""alcohol, drunkenness, and drugs that saturate the novel\"": \""Mahfouz's reformist prophets in Children of the Alley are no strangers to taverns and opium dens. But this is typical of Naguib, as most of his novels contain scenes of this sort. Most likely his immersion in the everyday life of the masses caused him to take note of this popular cultural phenomenon, which is still common in Egypt in spite of widespread religious devotion and the strict penalties for breaking these kinds of prohibitions.\""[25] The Shaykh revealed that he'd met Mahfouz to discuss the novel, and that he told him that State Security was responsible for passing it on to Al-Azhar and requesting that it be banned. \""That's because the shaykhs of Al-Azhar don't read this type of literature,\"" Mahfouz replied.[26] In the end, the book was published minus the novel itself. Only the introductions that had been written for the novel were included, and the Grand Mufti's piece never materialized.\n\nMahfouz had been less than enthusiastic about these attempts to publish the novel. When he found out about them from his hospital bed, he said to Gamal al-Ghitani and Yusuf al-Qa'id: \""Isn't what I'm going through right now enough? It's a lot to handle.\""[27] In a statement to Al-Ahram, Mahouz said that because of the way in which the novel had been misinterpreted, he feared that \""the reader won't be able to approach it objectively, but will only read it to hunt for proof of the charges leveled against it. And since the novel is an allegory, he won't find it hard to give it whatever meaning he fancies.\""[28] Mahfouz explained his refusal to publish by pointing out that the real issue now was the attempted assassination of an author. Publishing the novel now would mean it had become a party to the conflict, and that the whole story would then become about the novel's attitude towards religion: \""The novel would only be read from a scriptural and theological point of view in this context, when it should be read as literature proper. If this were to happen, all literary fiction could become the province of religious readings. What's needed now is a struggle to analyze and explain in order to acquit the novel of the charge of blasphemy and the author of the charge of apostasy. We can publish it later.\""[29]\n\nShaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, then under-secretary of the Ministry of Religious Endowments, had written the first report demanding the ban on Children of the Alley back in 1959. Al-Ghazali had served as a witness for the defense in the 1993 Farag Foda assassination trial where he famously asserted that anyone refusing implementation of the shar'ia was an apostate, and that the killing of an apostate was therefore lawful. He was among those who paid Mahfouz a visit after the assassination attempt. It was his way of letting it be known that he condemned the incident. Yusuf al-Qa'id reported the details of the meeting. According to al-Qa'id, al-Ghazali commented on the various attempts to publish the novel in Egypt as follows: \""Poison has a way of spreading surreptitiously and people are always keen to get their hands on it.\"" He declared that he was firmly against publication of the novel, but that he abhorred the attempt on Mahfouz's life \""which is in no way tolerated by religion or religious law.\"" On the inflammatory books written about the novel -including Shaykh Abd al-Hamid Kishk's notorious Our Response to Children of the Alley, al-Ghazali merely commented that Kishk was \""an ignorant man.\""[30] Mahfouz ended the discussion by affirming that he respected Ghazali's position on the novel: \""any and all opinions are welcome, but the problem arises from positions that are not opinions; the problem is those who kill.\""[31]\n\nMahfouz had no objections to an opinion no matter how extreme. He wasn't angry with Children of the Alley's critics so much as at the fatwa calling for his murder by Omar Abd al-Rahman. Abd al-Rahman was a student of Sayyid Qutb, the godfather of religious extremism. Qutb's 1964 book, Signposts, was the standard reference for all the jihadist movements founded on violence. The book gave their operations the cover of legitimacy. The knife plunged into Mahfouz's neck appeared to have been wielded by the hand of an old friend. But how did Qutb meet Mahfouz and how did they part ways? It's likely that, during his long hospital confinement, Mahfouz spent a lot of time brooding over this curious relationship.\n\n_\n\nMohamed Shoair is a cultural critic, writer and journalist from Egypt; he is presently editor of the journal Akhbar al-Adab.

Abd al-Jalil,0,"\Chapter Twelve: October 14, 1994\"" is at the heart of Mohamed Shoair's acclaimed 2018 popular history, Children of the Alley: The Story of the Forbidden Novel. The book tells of how Egypt's Nobel literature laureate came to write and publish his most controversial novel, and how it led to the attempt on his life. Chapter 12 takes place on the day Naguib Mahfouz was near-fatally stabbed:\n\n\""The air was choked with dust\"" as Naguib Mahfouz wrote in the opening to his 1961 novel The Thief and the Dogs. Sandstorms had slammed into Cairo, causing accidents and property damage of all kinds, and some of the southern governorates were drowned in widespread flooding from violent thunderstorms. Mahfouz was in the habit of leaving his house at 5:30 p.m. on Friday afternoons and heading to his famous weekly literary gathering in Qasr Al-Nil Café, where he regularly met his friends and harafish.[1] On this day, October 14, 1994, Dr. Fathi Hashim waited outside to drive him there. Yet Hashim wasn't alone. Another young man was waiting outside with a concealed switchblade. He approached the car as Mahfouz settled into the passenger seat and plunged the knife into his neck. \""I saw a terrifying monster close in on me and tear at my throat with his teeth,\"" Mahfouz recalled.[2] A fountain of blood gushed from the wound, and the assailant fled. 'God help us!' Egyptians from all walks of life exclaimed in horror when the news started to spread.\n\nA few days later, police released the suspect's name: Mohammad Naji. The incident was the climax of a violent struggle between the Egyptian state and the jihadists in a wave of terrorist bombings that had claimed the lives of foreign tourists and Coptic Christians and targeted intellectuals and politicians for assassination. The conflict had created a hostile environment for civil liberties and had left many people convinced that \""the coming victory of the theocratic state was inevitable,\"" in the words of Nasr Hamid Abu-Zayd, and that \""many were those who would be obliged to reserve a seat at its table.\""[3]\n\nA year before the attempt on Mahfouz's life, the Ministry of Education had removed his 1944 novel The Struggle of Thebes from the secondary school curriculum. The Curriculum Committee's excuse for this decision was a financial conflict with the publisher over the sum of eight piasters per copy of the book (the publisher was asking for 104 piasters per copy while the Ministry insisted on 96). In an astonishing move, the committee chose The Bold Eagle by Abd al-Salam Zaydan, a little-know author of children's fiction,to replace Mahfouz's novel, although the price per copy was 124 piasters -- twenty piasters more than the price refused by the Ministry for The Struggle of Thebes. A few days before this decision, the same committee saw fit to lighten the burden placed on Egyptian high school students by removing Mahfouz's Nobel Prize acceptance speech from the curriculum. In an editorial, the cultural weekly Akhbar al-Adab described the Ministry's actions as a conspiracy against the Dean of the Egyptian Novel himself.[4]\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd was making the rounds of the courts in a case that had begun just a few months earlier. He had provoked a firestorm when he came up for promotion at Cairo University in March of 1993 with three publications that used new critical methodologies for studying religious texts: The Concept of the Text: a Study of the Quranic Sciences, Imam al-Shafi'i and the Foundation of the Ideology of the Middle Path,and Critique of Religious Discourse. A group of conservative university professors led by Abd al-Sabur Shahin[5] concluded that firing Abu Zayd would represent \""a blow to secularism at the university.\"" Shahin swiftly produced a robust report denying Abu Zayd promotion and accusing him of apostasy. He then began attacking Abu Zayd in his weekly Friday sermons. It was a grim chain of events that eventually culminated in a lawsuit to forcibly divorce Abu Zayd from his wife and colleague Ibtihal Yunis, professor of French literature at Cairo University, on the grounds that the marriage of a Muslim woman to an apostate was legally null and void.[6]\n\nEight months before the assassination attempt on February 10, 1994, the General Assembly of the Egyptian State Council's Department of Legislation and Fatwas presided over by Judge Tariq al-Bishri issued a fatwa confirming that Al-Azhar University alone reserved the sole right to evaluate the granting of Ministry of Culture licenses for artistic and audiovisual works that touched on the Muslim religion, or that were deemed to conflict with its principles. The fatwa claimed the explicit authority to prohibit printing, registration, and distribution of such works, and stated that, as the sole institution responsible for the integrity of the text of the Blessed Quran, the bureaus of research, publication, and translation of Al-Azhar's Islamic Research Complex were the exclusive and legitimate oversight bodies for said works. As such, the opinion of Al-Azhar University, as concluded through its relevant organs, was to be binding on the parties entrusted with the decision to publish. Egyptian civil society institutions considered this fatwa to be \""the State Council's attempt to demolish the basis of secular government and to resurrect theocracy,\"" and Gaber Asfour, then Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Culture, declared that the fatwa would \""make a religious institution judge and jury over people's consciences, and stand in the way of artistic freedom.\"" [7]\n\nThe odd thing was that the state's censorship bodies had no need of fatwas. They had already begun to flex their muscles when MP Jalal Gharib submitted an official query to the Minister of Culture on the floor of Parliament in January of 1994 in which he protested IbdaaMagazine's recent reproduction of Austrian artist Gustav Klimt's painting \""Adam and Eve.\"" Gharib also lodged a protest against the Ministry's festival for experimental theater, as well as the Cairo Opera orchestra (explaining that there was no need for such things in the country of al-Azhar). On the same day a few hours after this incident, a committee from the Administrative Control Authority[8] presented a list of novels it had compiled to the executive officers of the state-owned General Egyptian Book Organization (GEBO): The Face of Dawn by Yusuf Abu Raya, The J Verse by Hasan Talib, The Rose of Rage by Farid Abu Saada, The Naked Ones by Ibrahim Eissa, I Am the Body's Beauty by Mohammad Adam, Creatures of Flying Desire by Edwar al-Kharrat, Azbakiyya Gardens by Mohammad Abd al-Salam al-Umri, Ghitani's Maps and The Zafarani Files by Gamal al-Ghitani, and A Children's Story by Mukhtar al-Suwayfi. The committee wanted detailed information about the circumstances surrounding their publication and how each title had been chosen. The committee took excerpts from the proscribed books and issued instructions prohibiting their sale or removal from GEBO bookstores and warehouses, then sent the confiscated books to Al-Azhar for its opinion. Around the same time, printers at the GEBO presses launched their own form of censorship by refusing to typeset a short story by the woman writer Ni'mat al-Bihayri in Ibdaa Magazinebecause they judged it to be pornographic. \""I've got my orders straight from GEBO's president\"" one printer later told the magazine's editor-in-chief Abd al-Mu'ti Hijazi. \""If a story smells fishy, I report it.\""[9]\n\nMahfouz expressed his astonishment at the Administrative Control Authority's actions and, in a statement to Akhbar al-Adab, described the confiscations as a severe threat to artistic freedom.[10] Al-Ahram newspaper had just recently begun to publish his Echoes of an Autobiography, which Mahfouz himself described as \""the ravings of an old man,\"" and as \""reflections difficult to categorize in literary terms.\""[11] He was uneasy about the experiment, and he refused to have the work published as a book, especially since Al-Ahram hadn't put much effort into publicizing or distributing the serialization. Mahfouz felt that the newspaper had not done him justice as a prominent author. The installments of Echoes of an Autobiography had been carefully buried in the newspaper's back pages.\n\nIt was in this general environment that a group of intellectuals signed a statement titled \""In Defense of Culture\"" condemning the incident in Parliament: \""As intellectuals, authors, and artists, we have observed with anger and astonishment the crude interference in cultural and artistic affairs demonstrated by the uncivilized and inappropriate confrontation between a Member of Parliament and the Minister of Culture. This campaign is part and parcel of the larger terrorist project underway against the Egyptian people. We condemn this feverish campaign, and hereby declare that we stand in unified opposition to it.\""[12] Mahfouz was one of the signatories to the statement; a rare and unusual thing for him. The last time he had put his signature to paper was for the 1972 writers' statement in support of the student movement occupations, and the movement's demands for democracy and an end to the stalemate with Israel.[13]\n\nA month before the assassination attempt, Dr. Ibrahim Kamil asked Mahfouz his opinion about Egypt's war on terrorism. Mahfouz replied, \""The police have won the current battle, but I fear that society as a whole has lost the war. The return to religious foundations has expanded in an unprecedented way. Look at any educated person and the degree to which they talk about religion and make it a cornerstone of their daily lives. Even though contemporary terrorism has no connection to Islam, we've all slipped down to their level and engage in the battle according to their conditions. This is the most pressing danger.\""[14] Yet in spite of the omens that preceded it, the attempt on Mahfouz's life had nevertheless come as a surprise to the intelligentsia. Hadn't Mahfouz himself refused a personal security detail on the heels of Omar Abd al-Rahman's notorious fatwa a few years earlier?[15] With his usual sense of irony, Mahfouz commented, \""If a bodyguard is assigned to follow me around, he's the one who'll end up murdering me. My love of walking will surely torture him. He'll have to walk with me every day and after a while he'll get fed up and kill me.\""[16] After the attack, Mahfouz was moved to the Police Hospital near his house in Agouza. The knife had torn through the muscles and veins of his neck and permanently damaged the nerves of his right arm. Gamal al-Ghitani reported that, when he finally woke from the lengthy surgery, he turned to the people around him and said, \""You're meant to be afraid, you're meant to shut up.\""[17]\n\nTwo days later, the police arrested the members of the cell that had been charged with carrying out the crime. It quickly became clear that they belonged to the military wing of the outlawed Islamic Group. The main witness to the crime -- Dr. Fathi Hashim -- identified the primary suspect, Muhammad Naji, from a photograph. The investigation revealed that their original plan wasn't to kill Mahfouz but to kidnap him in a taxi and hold him hostage in their hideout in the neighborhood of Al-Khanka in exchange for the release of a number of their imprisoned leaders. The taxi arrived late, however, which prevented the conspirators from carrying out the kidnapping and forced the accused to strike precipitously. The investigation also revealed that the group was planning to bomb Cinema Heliopolis and the Cairo Book Fair -- which was to be held a few months later in January of 1995 -- as well as to assassinate Nasr Hamid Abu-Zayd in his Giza apartment.[18]\n\nThe accused stated that he committed the crime because of Mahfouz's attack on Islam in Children of the Alley. \""We didn't read the novel, but soon after the Islamic Group's assassination of Farag Foda, orders came down to kill its author.\"" He added that he had no regrets for what he had done, and that if he were released he wouldn't hesitate to make a second attempt.[19] Mahfouz responded to this statement on the following day: \""The charge of apostasy cannot be made in the absence of the accused. Likewise, people with no authority to issue fatwas and who do not properly understand their own religion have no right to pass legal judgment on such matters. I continue to insist that Children of the Alley is simply a literary work and can only be understood in this light, and that it is a novel that affirms the importance of faith in the divine being.[20]\n\nDuring the investigation, Mahfouz once again insisted on his purpose in writing the novel: \""Children of the Alley, like the stories in Kalila and Dimna, depicts an imaginary world in order to implicate the real one. Kalila and Dimna is set in a world of forest-dwelling animals, but we know -- and the ordinary reader knows -- that the intention is to critique human beings, political regimes and the relations of power between people; the wisdom of the wise and the stupidity of the stupid. But so long as we continue to agree that we are in the forest, our protagonists must be animals. We cannot be held accountable for depicting them as animals, because the animal here is a symbol. This was the same logic with which I wrote Children of the Alley, a novel about a group of Egyptians living in an alley and the totality of the oppressive world they inhabit...These men don't read novels with a literary or humanist eye that seeks to discover the truth and understand the contest between good and evil. The only thing that matters to them is that the work submit to the strict letter of religious law. And even in this they exaggerate because religion itself presents the story of good and evil according to the clearest principles: the story of Satan's defiance of God for example. I absolutely did not intend to attack religion or to blaspheme against it in the novel and the accusation that I am an atheist or an apostate is nothing but pure slander.\""[21] After Mahfouz had given his deposition, the chief prosecutor asked him to sign it but, as he was unable to hold the pen with his injured hand, the assistant prosecutor was forced to take his thumbprint instead.\n\nAshraf Ashmawi, one of the prosecutors who oversaw the investigation, relates that during the proceedings Mahfouz asked him why he had been attacked. \""I gave him the answer I thought would comfort him and said that the perpetrator thought he was doing it for the good of society. He wasn't satisfied with that: 'but what was his point of view in this?' I replied cautiously: 'they believe that society can only be reformed by killing apostates.' I apologized for the term and explained that the accused himself had used this expression during his interrogation. Mahfouz gave me a friendly smile and said there was no need to apologize, then surprised me by saying: 'I know they haven't read the novel but I'd like to know if they've read any of my other books.'\""[22] Mahfouz in fact requested permission from the prosecution to present the accused with some of his books. He instructed his wife to bring three novels from his library to the hospital, which was next door to his house. In them he wrote the following dedication: \""To those who oppose my point of view, I dedicate these lines of mine to the well-being of a society which can only be reformed through culture.\""[23]\n\n*****\n\nAccording to novelist Yusuf al-Qa'id, the first thing Mahfouz wrote after the incident, on the morning of Friday October 28 1994, was an authorization granting Al-Ahram the sole right to publish the novel. The purpose of this authorization was to give the newspaper the ability to initiate expedited legal proceedings against a number of other newspapers which had announced they would be serializing Children of the Alley in their pages. Two newspapers in particular began the feverish race to publish: Al-Masaa and Al-Ahali. The former had announced it would begin publishing the novel on Saturday 29 October, with Mahfouz's authorization - which Mahfouz denied he had given. The paper published six installments of the novel then ceased publication at Mahfouz's request. This was the second time that Al-Masaa had attempted to publish the novel-the paper had brought out one installment on the heels of Mahfouz's Nobel Prize in 1988, and back then Tharwat Abaza had intervened in his capacity as President of the Writer's Union to halt publication. Al-Ahali newspaper -the organ of the Tagammu' Party -- published the novel as a special issue on October 30. This was the first time the complete novel had been published in Egypt, and just two weeks after the assassination attempt at that. According to the editors, the issue immediately sold out. Its front page carried the header \""For the first time in Egypt in thirty-five years, the complete text of Naguib Mahfouz's novel, Children of the Alley, is finally available to the Egyptian people.\"" The issue included articles by important critics and journalists -- Mahmud Amin al-Alim, Shukri Ayyad, Farida al-Naqqash, Gaber Asfour, Salama Ahmad Salama and the actor Adel Imam, accompanied by illustrations by the artists Abd al-Ghani Abu al-Aynayn and Juda Khalifa.\n\nMeanwhile, the government mood was pro-publication, which became clear when Safwat al-Sharif (then Minister of Information who had been previously opposed to publication) visited Mahfouz at the Police Hospital where he was being treated. Mahfouz's wife asked him about the ban on the novel, and he replied to her and to the journalists present: \""There is no ban on any cultural production in Egypt today.\"" This statement was immediately understood as a new official position regarding Children of the Alley. After all, Al-Ahali's publication announcement had been advertised -with no opposition from the authorities -- on state TV. Moreover, Nabil Abaza, editor in chief of Kitab al-Youm, a popular monthly book imprint published by the government-owned Akhbar al-Youm Institute, announced yet another edition. Abaza contacted a number of prominent critics for introductions to the novel, and told them that the Grand Mufti of the Republic himself, Shaykh Muhammad Sayyid al-Tantawi, had also promised to write one. Both the novel and the essays about it were to be published in the December 1994 issue of the monthly. The Story of Children of the Alley included articles by critic Mahmud Amin al-Alim, GEBO President Samir Sarhan, and Shaykh ENTITY Shalabi, the former secretary general of the Islamic Research Complex. Shalabi had attacked Children of the Alley when Mahfouz won the Nobel Prize in 1988. He had described the novel then as \""the true progenitor of Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses,\"" and went on to explain that \""Mahfouz's novel has been translated into many foreign languages such as English, French, and Hebrew, and it won't have been difficult for Rushdie to have read it and woven his own novel after its pattern.\""[24] Shalabi didn't repeat this claim in his article about the novel however. There, he described the novel as \""an indication of the repression and destitution that people suffered in those days. When their property was confiscated in the wave of Nasser-era nationalizations, they didn't dare complain. The novel tells them that the prophets themselves were persecuted because of the message they preached, and that they must follow the example of the prophets and hope that one day the night will end and the day will come.\"" Even though Shalabi's analysis of the novel did contain some intelligent criticism, he seemed most interested in the \""alcohol, drunkenness, and drugs that saturate the novel\"": \""Mahfouz's reformist prophets in Children of the Alley are no strangers to taverns and opium dens. But this is typical of Naguib, as most of his novels contain scenes of this sort. Most likely his immersion in the everyday life of the masses caused him to take note of this popular cultural phenomenon, which is still common in Egypt in spite of widespread religious devotion and the strict penalties for breaking these kinds of prohibitions.\""[25] The Shaykh revealed that he'd met Mahfouz to discuss the novel, and that he told him that State Security was responsible for passing it on to Al-Azhar and requesting that it be banned. \""That's because the shaykhs of Al-Azhar don't read this type of literature,\"" Mahfouz replied.[26] In the end, the book was published minus the novel itself. Only the introductions that had been written for the novel were included, and the Grand Mufti's piece never materialized.\n\nMahfouz had been less than enthusiastic about these attempts to publish the novel. When he found out about them from his hospital bed, he said to Gamal al-Ghitani and Yusuf al-Qa'id: \""Isn't what I'm going through right now enough? It's a lot to handle.\""[27] In a statement to Al-Ahram, Mahouz said that because of the way in which the novel had been misinterpreted, he feared that \""the reader won't be able to approach it objectively, but will only read it to hunt for proof of the charges leveled against it. And since the novel is an allegory, he won't find it hard to give it whatever meaning he fancies.\""[28] Mahfouz explained his refusal to publish by pointing out that the real issue now was the attempted assassination of an author. Publishing the novel now would mean it had become a party to the conflict, and that the whole story would then become about the novel's attitude towards religion: \""The novel would only be read from a scriptural and theological point of view in this context, when it should be read as literature proper. If this were to happen, all literary fiction could become the province of religious readings. What's needed now is a struggle to analyze and explain in order to acquit the novel of the charge of blasphemy and the author of the charge of apostasy. We can publish it later.\""[29]\n\nShaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, then under-secretary of the Ministry of Religious Endowments, had written the first report demanding the ban on Children of the Alley back in 1959. Al-Ghazali had served as a witness for the defense in the 1993 Farag Foda assassination trial where he famously asserted that anyone refusing implementation of the shar'ia was an apostate, and that the killing of an apostate was therefore lawful. He was among those who paid Mahfouz a visit after the assassination attempt. It was his way of letting it be known that he condemned the incident. Yusuf al-Qa'id reported the details of the meeting. According to al-Qa'id, al-Ghazali commented on the various attempts to publish the novel in Egypt as follows: \""Poison has a way of spreading surreptitiously and people are always keen to get their hands on it.\"" He declared that he was firmly against publication of the novel, but that he abhorred the attempt on Mahfouz's life \""which is in no way tolerated by religion or religious law.\"" On the inflammatory books written about the novel -including Shaykh Abd al-Hamid Kishk's notorious Our Response to Children of the Alley, al-Ghazali merely commented that Kishk was \""an ignorant man.\""[30] Mahfouz ended the discussion by affirming that he respected Ghazali's position on the novel: \""any and all opinions are welcome, but the problem arises from positions that are not opinions; the problem is those who kill.\""[31]\n\nMahfouz had no objections to an opinion no matter how extreme. He wasn't angry with Children of the Alley's critics so much as at the fatwa calling for his murder by Omar Abd al-Rahman. Abd al-Rahman was a student of Sayyid Qutb, the godfather of religious extremism. Qutb's 1964 book, Signposts, was the standard reference for all the jihadist movements founded on violence. The book gave their operations the cover of legitimacy. The knife plunged into Mahfouz's neck appeared to have been wielded by the hand of an old friend. But how did Qutb meet Mahfouz and how did they part ways? It's likely that, during his long hospital confinement, Mahfouz spent a lot of time brooding over this curious relationship.\n\n_\n\nMohamed Shoair is a cultural critic, writer and journalist from Egypt; he is presently editor of the journal Akhbar al-Adab.

AL-TIKRITI,1,"The decision to place Muslims on the secret database was based on biased reports [Getty]\n\nA new Al-Jazeera documentary reveals that hundreds of thousands of Muslims may have been arbitrarily placed on a 'terrorism' database run by private company World-Check, based on spurious media reports. A documentary by the Arabic news television network Al-Jazeera has revealed details of a little-known intelligence database containing the names of hundreds of thousands of Muslims arbitrarily accused of terrorism.\n\nThe World-Check database, which is used by 49 of the 50 largest banks in the world, contains the names of three million people, and 25,000 names on average are added to it every month. Police forces and intelligence agencies around the world also use it.\n\nThe database, which is effectively a blacklist, places individuals in various categories. Some are accused of money laundering and corruption while others are accused of financing terrorism.\n\nRead more: How the War on Terror facilitates repression\n\nThe Al-Jazeera documentary, part of the What's Hidden is Worse series, revealed that thousands of Muslim individuals and institutions had been placed on the World-Check blacklist, among them the trustees of London's Finsbury Park Mosque.\n\nAs a result, the mosque's bank account was closed on the grounds that it supported terrorism. After the Finsbury Park trustees took World-Check to court, the company apologised to them and removed the mosque's name from the list.\n\nFarooq Bajwa, a lawyer representing people who had been placed on the terrorism blacklist, told Al-Jazeera that individuals would sometimes be named on the list simply as a result of Google searches.\n\nBajwa estimated that one million of the three million names on the World-Check list were there because of supposed \terrorist\"" affiliations, 90 percent of them Muslims.\n\nWorld-Check would sometimes place people on the terrorism list only because of negative coverage in pro-Israeli and right-wing blogs, according to the Al-Jazeera documentary.\n\nIn addition, it would place people and organisations on its list because they were on other terrorism lists published by authoritarian governments in the Middle East, such as those of the UAE and Egypt, without any regard to the nature of these governments and their suppression of domestic opposition.\n\nIn July 2015, the HSBC bank accounts of the Cordoba Foundation think tank and its chief executive, Anas ENTITY, were closed after World-Check listed them on its database.\n\nMiddle East Eye reported at the time that this was because Cordoba Foundation was listed as a \""terrorist organization\"" by the UAE government. A UAE list released in 2014 also included the global charity Islamic Relief among supposed \""terrorist organizations\"".\n\nWorld-Check is a private company but being placed on its list could have serious legal implications for individuals. The company's lack of transparency and its seemingly arbitrary classification of individuals raises concerns regarding human and legal rights.\n\nWorld-Check used to be owned by Thomson Reuters but in 2018, the media conglomerate sold 55 percent of its shares in the company.\n\nAnother person who was placed on its list was Egyptian football star Mohamed Abutrika. Following the 2013 coup in Egypt, the Sisi government froze his assets and placed him on its terror list, saying he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nAbutrika denies any affiliation to the organization and World-Check's decision to place him on the list seems to have been based on reports in pro-Sisi Egyptian media.\n\nIn 2019, Palestinian-British activist Majed al-Zeer, the director of the UK-based Palestinian Return Centre (PRC), took World-Check to court and won a payout of 10,000 pounds after having his name removed.\n\nThe PRC has campaigned extensively for the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their lands and WorldCheck's decision to blacklist al-Zeer was based on an unsubstantiated claim by the Israeli government that he was a member of Hamas."
Muhammad Mustapha Abdallah,1,"There is tension in the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) as some concerned officers have opened a can of worms, accusing Col. ENTITY (rtd), the agency's Chairman/Chief Executive, of impunity and flagrant violation of presidential directive.\n\nWorried over the state of affairs, the officers have also petitioned Ibrahim Magu, Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), alleging Abdallah of complicity in an alleged N1.5 billion said to have been garnered through a recruitment exercise.\n\nThe officers also urged the EFCC helmsman to urgently institute a probe of the NDLEA boss and Mr. Yohanna-Silas Mshelia, the agency's Director of Administration and Finance, who they said was due for retirement on October 11, 2019 after attaining the age of 60, but had sat tight due to alleged corrupt practices between the two top officials.\n\nThey want Magu to investigate how monies accruing to the NDLEA from various sources, including recruitment and overheads were being spent by Abdallah and Mshelia.\n\nMusa Ahmed Yusuf, spokesperson of the 'Concerned Officers', in the petition titled 'Confusion And Impunity In NDLEA As Chairman Defies Presidential Order And Retired Director Continues In Office Over N1.5 Billion Recruitment Money', a copy of which was exclusively obtained by NEXT EDITION, said there was unprecedented display of impunity, corruption and administrative rascality in the agency.\n\nThey also accused their boss of violation of presidential directive on suspension of international travels by all cabinet members and heads of government agencies to expedite action on the 2020 budget defence.\n\nIn the petition, the officers told Magu that Abdallah had been embarking on foreign trips, the recent of which were to Mauritania and Brazil, instead of staying home in compliance with President Muhammadu Buhari's directives to public officials in his category.\n\nThe petition read in part: \The Concerned Officers of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) are writing to report the unprecedented display of impunity, corruption and administrative rascality in the agency.\n\n\""The Chairman/Chief Executive of the agency, Col. ENTITY (rtd), has flagrantly violated the presidential directive for the suspension of international travels by all cabinet members and Heads of Government Agencies so as to expedite action on the 2020 budget defence.\n\n\""Unfortunately, Abdallah's inordinate addiction to foreign travels could not allow him respect the presidential embargo on foreign travels. In September 2019, he was in Mauritius and later travelled to the United States only to return on October 4, 2019.\n\n\""Despite the presidential directive, Abdallah left Nigeria again on Saturday October 12, 2019 to Brazil for International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL) meeting. The reason for travelling may sound plausible, but this is not true with Abdallah because he needs to explain why he was conspicuously absent at the INTERPOL Conference held in Abuja in August 2019, even when he was in town.\n\n\""All heads of security agencies were present in Abuja at that meeting, except Abdallah. The reason is obvious, because there is no allowance in dollars since it is within town.\""\n\nThe officers also alleged that Yohanna-Silas Mshelia, the agency's Director of Administration and Finance, who should have retired on October 11, 2019 after attaining the age of 60, had till date not handed over.\n\nThe accused Mshella, who was called to the Bar in 1984 and was allegedly \""employed on Grade Level 14 contrary to regulations\"", of refusing to hand over as he was said to be afraid of a possible investigation into the disbursements of N.5 billion recruitment money without following due process.\n\nThe officers told Magu, \""Concerned officers have also discovered the main reason why the Director of Administration and Finance, Yohanna-Silas Mshelia, who retired from service on October 11, 2019 after attaining 60 years refused to hand over.\n\n\""He was called to Bar in 1984 and was employed with a Bachelor degree in Law on Grade Level 14 contrary to entry regulations. Yohanna is afraid to hand over now because the N1.5 billion recruitment money has been unprofessionally disbursed to faceless companies without compliance with due process. Therefore, to cover the can of worms and skeletons in his cupboard, he is afraid to hand over.\""\n\nThey maintained that since he allegedly retired, Mshelia had been coming to the office daily since Monday October 14, 2019, and had continued to discharge the responsibilities of the Director of Administration and Finance with all the apparatus of office.\n\nThe officers stated: \""Even appeal from other directors for him to take the path of honour and obey the laws of the country has met with stiff resistance because Yohanna and Abdallah have kept other directors in the dark regarding the recruitment funds.\n\n\""He is said to be handling all the supplies contracts such as uniforms, officer's boot/foot wears and uniform accessories for the on-going recruitment. He is also in charge of feeding of the cadets during the training period.\n\n\""Indeed, absolute power corrupts absolutely. Yohanna (Mshelia) may have easily forgotten his directive in June 2019 to a former Commander, but it is still very fresh in our memories. The former Commander in Niger State, Mr. Joseph Iweajunwa, wrote him a letter requesting for two days extension for him to hand over on June 28 instead of his retirement date of 26th because he had no assistant then.\n\n\""Yohanna's reply was short and straight forward. 'You are mandated to stick to your official date of 26th and hand over to the most senior officer as any extension is criminal,' Yohanna ordered.\""\n\nThey added: \""We the concerned officers hereby demand a strict compliance with the law as justice requires a level playing ground for all parties. Has he forgotten the directive he gave in June 2019 or has the rules suddenly changed?\n\n\""It is only during his tenure as director that the administrative faux pas of a commander not having deputies became commonplace.\n\n\""The payment of the sum of N100 million to an incompetent and petty ICT firm, by name Emplug, for creating the online portal for the ongoing recruitment, speaks volumes of the monumental fraud being perpetrated by Yohanna.\n\n\""Concerned officers gathered that the moribund Emplug firm is located in a makeshift office under the staircase at Victory Plaza, No 7 Onitsha Crescent, off Gimbiya Street, Area 11 Garki, Abuja.\n\n\""Already, the sum of N60 million had been paid to Emplug for creating an online portal that lasted for only three weeks. Investigations also discovered that the recruitment portal was actually designed by the ICT department of the agency. Still, Mshelia and Abdallah went ahead to pay such a whopping amount of money to Emplug.\""\n\nThey concerned officers alleged that the NDLEA boss, Abdallah, had been reluctant to release Mshelia \""because of their secret financial dealings. Mr Yohanna-Silas Mshelia, a lawyer who lacks accounting knowledge, has turned into a ready accomplice in the criminal payment of large chunks of the agency's monthly overhead allocation to Abdallah to lubricate his unquenchable crave for inconsequential foreign travels since 2016.\n\nREAD ALSO: EFCC Raid Zamfara INEC Office, Recovers 4 'Ghana-must- go' Bags\n\n\""Upon assumption of office in 2016, Abdallah also stopped the monthly overhead cost to commanders. This is a very dangerous and tacit endorsement of corruption when commanders are starved of daily running cost.\n\n\""Abdallah has the worst record in terms of welfare of officers in the history of the agency. Under the dark and draconic tenure of Abdallah, over 130 officers have lost their lives. Majority of the officers died of depression arising from the bitterness of criminal stagnation in one rank for over a decade.\n\n\""Sadly enough, none of the deceased have been paid their benefits, not even burial expenses. The October 2017 incident where gunmen killed three of our colleagues in Kogi State, Onwumere Nicholas, Peter Ebun and Abdulrahman Musa only for Abdallah to send the paltry sum of N50,000, is still a bitter pill in our mouth.\n\n\""We have endured with the hope that Abdallah will one day cause officers to smile, but he is getting worse by the day. At the last management meeting he held on Thursday October 10, 2019 after his return from the United States, we were expecting promotion, but we were all shocked when Abdallah said at the meeting that promotion was the least item on his priority list.\n\n\""It is obvious, therefore, that he will not turn a new leaf. The level of disenchantment among officers has made an implosion inevitable.\""\n\nThey also alleged that when officers die in active service, Abdallah would not pay for burial expenses as demanded by law, stressing, \""He is so callous to the extent that he suggested that officers that died in a mob attack be given mass burial due to lack of money.\n\n\""Officers had to contribute money to convey the corpses of their late colleagues for a befitting burial. Even when officers are transferred, no allowance will be paid on the ground that there is no money. That is why we find it painful, sad and insulting that there is money for his monthly travels abroad and N100 million payment to Emplug for creating a portal.\n\nThey also maintained that recruitment in the agency was usually handled by a committee of officers drawn from the Directorates of Training and Administration, but, \""the ongoing recruitment is being handled by Mshelia and Abdallah, using Emplug that lacks the technical competence.\n\n\""Concerned officers uncovered a secret plot by Abdallah to deceive Nigerian youths by corruptly selecting 5,000 persons through the backdoor who did not apply online leaving the over 300,000 applicants that took the pain to apply in utter frustration and neglect.\n\n\""Concerned officers gathered that over300,000 applicants applied online for this recruitment, but unfortunately, Abdallah has shortlisted 5,000 that did not apply online for the job vacancies. Why ask Nigerians to take the pain of applying online when you have already selected your candidates? This is unacceptable to us as Nigerians.\""\n\nThe officers also alleged that apart from alleged corrupt practices of siphoning the agency's overhead for baseless foreign travels and the recruitment scandal, Abdallah has equally sat on officers' promotion.\n\nThe stated: \""In 2018, Abdallah in a circular with reference number NDLEA/ALS/ADM/100/V/90 acknowledged that officers have overstayed in one rank for over a decade and promised to address promotion of staff.\n\n\""In that circular titled 'Issues Relating To Promotion,' Abdallah stated that 'I have carefully considered all the issues relating to irregular and delayed promotion in the agency and I am determined to put in place an enduring and sustainable promotion process and procedure. This is to enable the agency achieve the desired morale for optimal productivity by the personnel.'\n\n\""Abdallah had promised to conclude the promotion of staff on grade level 03 to 06 by June 2018 and continue up the ladder, but the assurances never saw the light of the day. Even when he made officers to write promotion examination in August 2019, he still refused to release the promotion in October. These are clear signs of administrative ineptitude and nonchalance.\n\n\""The promotion of officers has been neglected by Abdallah as the time table he released in 2018 after several agitations was not adhered to. He only promoted 11 very senior officers and 1,311 junior others in 2018 and went to sleep.\n\n\""After much agitation he fixed examination for Salah period in August 2019 still, we went to write only for him to refuse to release the results. If he had released the promotion, it would have been captured in the proposed 2020 budget but he deliberately declined to do the needful because he has no interest in staff welfare. This is why we are calling for his immediate removal so that somebody with passion for the job can be appointed.\""\n\nThe officers would want Abdallah to be compelled to abort his Brazil trip, because if INTERPOL meeting was important, he should have attended the one held in Abuja in August 2019.\n\nThey also added: \""Yohanna-Silas Mshelia should be forced to hand over and return all agency properties, including his official vehicle, without staying a minute longer in office having attained the retirement age of 60.\n\n\""Both Mohammad Mustapha Abdallah and Yohanna-Silas Mshelia be probed and prosecuted for the diversion of the monthly overhead to needless foreign travels. They should also be investigated for the non-payment of running cost to commanders since 2016.\n\n\""The account of the agency be audited in the past four years. Abdallah should not be allowed to conduct the current recruitment exercise so that Nigerians can be selected on merit to serve their country.\n\n\""Emplug firm used by Abdallah and Mshelia to defraud the agency should be investigated and the N100 million deal be immediately revoked while the N60 million paid be refunded.\n\n\""The pending promotion of staff released and harmonisation be conducted to properly place officers where they belong. We also demand immediate release of monthly overhead to commanders to check corruption.\""\n\nHowever, several calls put across to Mr. Jonah Echema, NDLEA Public Relations Officer (PRO), was not picked. Text message also sent to his line was not responded to by press time.\n\nHowever, when asked if he was aware of the petition of the Concerned Officers of the NDLEA to Magu, contacted, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, the EFCC spokesman, said petitions to the commission do not usually come to him.\n\nBut, he stressed: \""People submit petitions to the EFCC every day. There is nothing special about the one by the NDLEA officers. The EFCC handles petitions as they come.\""\n\nOn the allegations that the EFCC might not handle the petition from the NDLEA because of the personality of Col. Abdallah (rtd), being a retired senior Army officer, Uwujaren also reiterated what he had earlier said that there was nothing special about this particular petition.\n\nHowever, sources close to the NDLEA maintain that such stories about the agency's helmsmen had been flying around for a long time, and that nothing positive might come out from the current move by the Concerned Officers of the agency."

MERCER,0,"In the last decade, Texas has become the world's oil and gas capital, and Dallas-Fort Worth is the place where energy deals get done. With producers and pipes-and-refineries companies shifting operations to Houston, North Texas' experience with the money side of the industry has fostered the growth of private equity firms that fund both startups and megadeals alike.\n\n\""As the industry gets more capital intensive and less labor-driven, Dallas is increasingly where checks are written to help my client companies add both to their management teams and the technology they need to grow faster,\"" says Bryce Erickson, a Dallas-based senior vice president at the valuation firm ENTITY Capital.\n\nBut while West Texas' Permian Basin is one of the biggest oil and gas plays ever, mid-tier crude prices mean change is coming starting this fall both for businesses that work there and the local financiers who back them. As of this summer, oil was trading in the $50 to $70 range in which it has been stuck since November 2016. \""Expectations are that the commodity prices that drive industry activity will not change significantly\"" in the near term, said Shishir Khetan, a Houston-based managing director in the valuation advisory group of Stout Risius Ross.\n\nStill, smaller oil and gas producers may find themselves in technical default on debt because of their banks' twice-a-year revaluation of their proved reserves based on what those lenders believe future oil and gas prices will look like, experts say. \""Of the restructurings happening in oil and gas, we will have more weighted on the exploration and production side,\"" says Drew Lockard, a Dallas-based managing director at Stretto, a consultancy for companies in distress.\n\nE&P businesses thus may see a round of mergers and acquisitions, as might the firms that help them find raw fuels in the ground and get them to the surface.\""Of the 95 publicly-traded oilfield services companies, the vast majority have market [values] so small that institutional investors won't touch them,\"" says Bruce Bullock, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at SMU. \""To help E&P companies grow, that segment must cut costs, which is easier if they consolidate.\""\n\nOf course, problems in oilfield services are a chance for someone else to make hay. \""We see the most opportunity of potential distress to add onto our existing investments and grow market share during any downturn,\"" says Chase Paxton, director of finance and valuations at Irving's NGP Energy Capital Management, which manages $12.4 billion in assets.\n\nAn issue facing production companies in particular is that investors increasingly value them by the same measuring sticks they use for other industries, such as the ability to generate free cash flow, Paxton says. Free cash flow is money businesses generate after paying for operations and maintaining their large properties. \""I believe that many E&Ps can generate cash and deliver the return on capital that investors are looking for,\"" said Paul Moorman, a Dallas-based managing director at Stephens, a large investment bank.\n\nBut that requires them to change how they do things, such as by consolidating their properties to build areas of expertise and running their businesses for the long term, he adds. \""It's not sufficient for them to say, 'I am going to drill a few wells and flip it to a larger operator.\"" Late this past summer, though, prices for E&P-related properties and companies were high enough to dissuade buying in that segment. \""There are more reluctant sellers, so there's large difference between the bid and the ask,\"" says Ryan Bartholomee, chief financial officer of Midland's Shenandoah Petroleum. \""We're focused on the leases we do have and getting those developed.\""\n\nAside from private equity, companies that need capital may look to wealthy families in DFW who invest privately in oil, gas, and renewable businesses. In the Dallas office of Tiedmann Advisors, which helps clients with money management, senior vice president Kyle Manley says the firm is positioning four to eight percent of some portfolios in \""midstream\"" businesses, which handle pipes and refineries. \""We've been early investors in a number of firms with great success over the years,\"" he said. \""In Texas, most families own some exposure to energy.\""\n\nPipeline constraints in the Permian means crude oil priced in Midland last year cost anywhere from 37 cents to $15 less than crude priced in Oklahoma, according to Ed Longanecker, president of the Austin-based Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association.\n\n\""This directly impacted the bottom line for operators, particularly smaller producers that have a higher breakeven point or less contracted takeaway capacity,\"" he says. Though industry is moving to add pipelines, \""the bottleneck may not be fully resolved until late 2019, assuming infrastructure projects and production stay on track.\""\n\nDFW's role in energy finance now matters because of technology advances in the last 10 years that make it economical to extract raw hydrocarbons encased in sedimentary rock. \""Up until this point in 2008 and 2009, crude production in Texas had done nothing but decline since the early 1970s. Conventional wisdom held this would continue, and nothing could be done to change this,\"" says Karr Ingham, Amarillo-based consulting petroleum economist to the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers.\""\n\nWhat changed was a series of small improvements to hydraulic fracturing -- or blasting underground rock open with high-pressure liquids -- and horizontal drilling, or cutting holes sideways or upward in the ground. Suddenly, drillers had affordable ways to draw crude oil and gas out of soft rock called shale. \""Everybody turned out to be utterly, fantastically wrong,\"" Ingham says. \""What we've done is quadrupled oil production in the last 10 to 11 years, more than doubled U.S. production, and become the most important producer on the planet at this point.\""\n\nEven with those gains, the formation may be richer still in underground fuels. \""The Permian Basin is the most prolific shale formation in the world,\"" Longanecker says. \""Oil production there could grow by over 50 percent by the year 2023. The federal Energy Information Administration forecasts that Permian shale oil in Texas alone will account for more than 50 percent of all new global production of that commodity over the next five years.\""\n\nAs the scope became apparent of Texas' new opportunity in energy, DFW was poised to move fast, given the expertise here in oil and gas finance. Some of it may be a legacy of the 1980s, when the state's banks were major lenders to the industry, according to Bernard Weinstein, economist and associate director of SMU's Maguire Energy Institute. \""Most of the big banks were based in Dallas-Fort Worth.\""\n\nThe finance roots extend 50-plus years, when local families like the Hunts, Murchisons and Richardsons agreed to let banks lend money to energy ventures they had backed based on reserves in the ground, according to Erickson of ENTITY Capital. \""They were pioneers.\""\n\nDFW wouldn't be an energy finance hub if not for its plethora of related vendors that handle key tasks on deals. The new work coming from places like the Permian has heated up an already tight talent market in our region (See \""Hotbed for High Finance,\"" below.)\n\nThe result: Local companies are having to adapt. \""The big firms have 80 hour work weeks. Ours are about average, sometimes a little higher or lower,\"" says John Vallance, who leads the Fort Worth energy industry group at Whitley Penn, a North Texas accountancy. The busy finance market has also helped build related energy-related businesses. \""When we started in 1993, we had 70 exhibitors and 700 attendees,\"" says Le'Ann Callihan, director of NAPE Expo, which puts on events for trading of energy-related land. \""This summer we had more than 1,200 exhibitors and 12,500 attendees at our annual summit.\""\n\nAnd with private equity having invested in small and mid-sized energy companies, lenders are reaping the benefits of the discipline that professional investors bring to their portfolio companies. \""The level of talent on the financial side of energy is incredible,\"" says Bill Schonacher, president and CEO of International Bank of Commerce-Oklahoma. \""That makes our jobs easier, as being creative in problem solving is a talent that the energy industry has,\"" adds Schonacher, whose organization is part of Laredo-based IBC Bank.\n\nTexas' humming oil and gas market is fueling efforts to build something similar in Mexico. The country's president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, wants to grow its industry from 3 percent to 4 percent of the economy, where it is now, to six percent, according to Raúl Cedeño Casillas, editor of Petróleo & Energia, a leading business magazine in Mexico. \""It's an ambitious goal,\"" he says, adding that the administration is trying to build foreign participation partly by eradicating corruption.\n\n\""It's no secret that relations with the United States have been rocky,\"" Casillas says. \""They're looking for investment. It's just that the parameters of the opportunity are being revised so they can move forward.\""\n\nPetróleo got its start amid efforts to add transparency to Mexico's state-owned oil company, Petróleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, according to Javier Senderos Lopez, a director who helps run the publication's business side. \""We saw a lot of suppliers to Pemex that were under the radar and needed promotion,\"" he says.\n\nSee the winners of D CEO's 2019 Oil & Gas Awards here.\n\nBefore Texas became an energy epicenter, the state's schools were improving the finance and business educations that now make graduates hot commodities in the industry. In Dallas, SMU launched an alternative assets management program, in which 50 undergrads learn about investment banking by building financial models and PowerPoint presentations based on case studies.\n\nThrough what students call \""alts\"" give them windows into more industries than oil, gas, and renewables. The modeling work is ideal for undergrads like Arthur Yuen, who is interested in the exploration and production side of energy. \""In my opinion, it's the most prestigious program on campus,\"" says Yuen, a competitive swimmer who, like all participants, went through roughly three weeks of mock interviews to get a spot in it. \""Every student is pushed to do the best we can.\""\n\nIn Fort Worth, TCU offers a 10-month graduate certificate for people working in energy, along with an undergraduate minor in the field. In addition to individualized study projects, students work with others on a capstone effort and have mentors, according to Ed Ireland, director of the TCU Energy Institute and the Ralph Lowe Energy Management Program. Mary Ralph Lowe, who endowed the program in the name of her wildcatter father, wanted \""to eliminate or significantly reduce on the job training,\"" Ireland says.\n\nTexas A&M offers a student-run program, Horizons, that connected finance and business major Mark Lutz with mentors working in investment banking. \""I learned from them about the exciting but demanding workflow they saw daily advising companies on significant decisions,\"" says Lutz, now an associate at Dallas' Tailwater Capital.\n\nAnton Cordes, a finance student who is helping run the program this year, used an internship to land a job upon graduation next year as an investment banking analyst in Barclays Capital's global natural resources group in Houston. \""While New York can be a great place to start a career, I decided I did not want to build a life there,\"" he says. \""Texas is where my family and friends are.\"
AL Hayat Media,1,"At its apotheosis, the Islamic State bridged the local and global divide more effectively than most violent extremist organisations -- jihadist or otherwise -- have ever done. Rather than mobilising \lone wolves,\"" it made individuals believe that they were not alone. They were actually part of a global community that was centered on, but not reducible to, the Islamic State's physical caliphate, where the group engaged in rebel governance. Although the Islamic State combined the physical control of territory where it provided goods and services with social media in ways no jihadist group had done before, its efforts in these areas were not sui generis.\n\nInsurgent movements and violent extremist organisations have historically used propaganda, and many of them have engaged in rebel governance where possible. There is no reason to suspect that other non-state actors could not replicate the Islamic State's success, or at least that they will not try to do so. This essay explores two inter-related areas: jihadist groups' efforts to advance alternate governance mechanisms; and the ways in which new technologies have evolved to enable these organisations to pursue supporters both locally and globally.\n\nThe year 2011 looked to be particularly bad for the jihadist movement. Drone strikes were degrading al-Qaeda in Pakistan. Operatives who were not killed had to prioritise their survival over the ability to move around, communicate, or execute transnational attacks. As a result, core al-Qaeda was on the ropes by the time US intelligence officers identified a compound in the upscale city of Abbottabad, Pakistan, as the place where Osama bin Laden might be hiding. Obama approved a high-risk raid by US Navy SEALs, and they killed the al-Qaeda leader on May 2, 2011, shortly after 1:00 a.m. local time. Information gathered during the raid enabled the United States to target additional high-ranking leaders with subsequent drone strikes. Meanwhile, successful transitions in Tunisia, Egypt, and Yemen seemingly undermined the jihadist narrative that violence was a necessary handmaiden for revolution or that the United States would always prop up autocratic regimes. The NATO-led intervention in Libya showed that the West would intervene to protect Muslim civilians.\n\nYet, far from being a death knell, revolutions across the Arab world reinvigorated jihadists and enabled a level of activity unforeseen hitherto. The weakening or outright removal of police states created space for mobilisation in places where jihadists had previously had little room for maneuver. While many experts initially focused on how the Arab uprisings affected the jihadist narrative, jihadist leaders recognised the opportunities the revolutions presented. A week before his death, bin Laden referred to the uprisings as \""a great and glorious event\"" and stressed the importance of winning new supporters through missionary outreach. The deputy emir of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) encouraged jihadists to take advantage of the newly open environments to spread their ideas.\n\nThis is precisely what they did. Jihadists in Egypt and Tunisia seized on their newfound operational freedom to organise and enlist supporters. The environment was even more open in Yemen, which was not a police state in the first place. Autocratic regimes in Libya and Syria deliberately facilitated jihadist mobilisation immediately after protests began in order to promote the narrative that they were fighting terrorism and to create conflict among various opposition groups. This helped jihadists emerge as some of the most organised forces in post-Gaddafi Libya and in the escalating conflict in Syria.\n\nLasting democratic transitions and improved governance did not accompany the deterioration of police states. Tunisia was the only Sunni-majority Arab state where a democratic transition held. And even there, the security situation deteriorated, contributing to a flow of foreign fighters to other conflict zones. Egypt slipped back into autocracy when the military overthrew the democratically elected prime minister. The new military-backed regime soon faced an escalating jihadist insurgency. Libya, Mali, Syria, and Yemen descended into civil war. In June 2014, the Islamic State, which had split from al-Qaeda earlier in the year, launched a major military offensive in Iraq that captured the country's second largest city, Mosul. Afterwards, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State's leader, announced the reestablishment of the caliphate, and declared himself the caliph. Numerous jihadist groups -- some of them previously loyal to al-Qaeda -- offered their allegiance.\n\nJihadists had limited experience engaging in governance before the Arab uprisings. For example, the Egyptian Islamic Group controlled \""liberated zones\"" in parts of Upper Egypt and Greater Cairo during the 1980s and into the early 1990, when it was at war with the state. The group simultaneously provided social services the government could not or would not provide, and engaged moral policing intended to purify the population. In the decade after 9/11, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan ran sharia courts in parts of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Northwest Frontier Province that were under its control. After al-Shabaab in Somalia broke away from the Islamic Courts Union and grew into a full-fledged jihadist organisation that seized control of large swaths of territory, it dispensed justice in accordance with its interpretation of sharia and also provided limited social services. Al-Qaeda in Iraq also enforced its harsh interpretation of Islamic law on territory it controlled before losing ground as a result of the Sunni Awakening and US military surge.\n\nThese limited experiences yielded valuable lessons, but jihadists also relied on the writings of the theoretician Abu Bakr Naji (the nom de guerre for Muhammad Khalil al-Hakaymah) when it came to seizing and governing territory after 2011. In The Management of Savagery, published almost a decade before the Arab uprisings, Naji laid out a three-step process for creating the caliphate. First, Naji argued that \""vexation strikes\"" were needed to draw the security forces away from certain areas in Muslim countries, and thus create the vacuums for jihadists to fill. Second, once jihadists had created chaos in these areas, they could fill the void by re-establishing order and imposing their version of Islamic law. In practice, this meant providing internal security and social services, establishing sharia justice (including forcing lax Muslims to comply with authority), and spreading understanding of Islamic law.16 The idea was to create a network of like-minded Islamic emirates, or mini-states, which could be as small as a city or as large as a country. These emirates would communicate with one another, and coordinate to the degree possible on political, financial, and military matters. Finally, once an acceptable caliph arrived, these emirates would transition from a network of mini-states into a caliphate.\n\nThe collapse of police states and advent of civil wars after the Arab uprisings fast-tracked the process Naji had envisioned, and ushered in two important trends within the jihadist movement. The first was a return of locally focused jihadist violence in the heart of the Arab world. The most robust revolutionary jihads since 9/11 had been waged against countries like Pakistan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia that previously supported or enabled jihadist groups. After the Arab uprisings, Arab states that had avoided or put down revolutionary challenges before 9/11 were forced to reckon with them. This renewed local emphasis was accented by the growing influence of sectarianism on jihadist agendas. The Islamic State inflamed and benefited from an increasingly bloody Sunni-Shi'a competition that infused other conflicts across the region. Second, jihadist organisations transformed into war-fighting militias that pursued state-building enterprises with greater sophistication. The Islamic State was the most successful group in terms of holding and administering territory. Its territory in Iraq and Syria formed the heart of the caliphate, but Baghdadi proclaimed he was the leader of all Muslims and his group soon began adding governorates in other countries. Some al-Qaeda affiliates simultaneously were declaring their own mini-emirates during this time in Mali and Yemen.\n\nNew movements, which called themselves Ansar al-Sharia, also emerged in multiple places as vehicles for popular mobilisation. Ansar al-Sharia means \""Partisans of Islamic law,\"" a name that emphasised the intention to establish Islamic states. Ansar al-Sharia branches effectively served as popular fronts that prioritised local agendas, used violence, preaching, and social services to achieve these goals, and attempted to engage in rudimentary state-building. AQAP created the first Ansar al-Sharia chapter in Yemen in 2009 as an insurgent force to capture territory and administer social services to the population. Additional branches formed in Libya, Tunisia, and Egypt during the Arab uprisings. These were independent entities with loose ties, if any, to one another. They signified both the local nature of jihadist activism after the Arab uprisings, and the fact that terrorism increasingly occupied just one part of a much larger jihadist portfolio.\n\nThe Islamic State and al-Qaeda became competing lodestars in the jihadist movement. There were notable differences between the two groups, including in how they interpreted Naji's theory of victory. First, Naji had envisioned the formation of the caliphate as a gradual process in which various emirates came together over time. Al-Qaeda leaders adhered to this vision, and believed it was necessary to build public support and make sure that suitable conditions existed before an Islamic state could be created. Islamic State leaders did not. They wasted little time declaring a caliphate after seizing large swaths of territory in Iraq.\n\nSecond, having suffered serious damage to its brand because of the large number of Muslims killed in Iraq and subsequent Sunni Awakening, al-Qaeda leaders advocated a population-centric approach designed to win over locals. Thus, AQ affiliates attempted to avoid killing innocent Muslims, and theoretically eschewed harsh treatment of the population on seized territory in favor of dawa and the provision of social services. The Islamic State took a different tact. The group inflamed sectarian tensions to create chaos, and then governed through fear. It provided social services, but also practiced shocking brutality as a way to cow the local population and foster a perception of strength. And it was uncompromising when it came to implementing harsh interpretations of sharia.\n\nBecause Naji recognised the need for manpower, he encouraged Muslims who lived in non-Muslims countries to immigrate, rather than remaining at home and conducting attacks. The Islamic State's mastery of social media and declaration of a caliphate helped it to inspire thousands of foreign fighters, who flocked to its banner in Iraq and Syria. This development was part of a larger trend: jihadists' use of technology to reach global audiences to a greater degree than ever before.\n\nIn the Call for Global Islamic Resistance, Abu Musab al-Suri (born Mustafa bin Abd al-Qadir Setmariam Nasar) argued that his fellow jihadists should limit large-scale insurgences to a small number of Muslim countries, and otherwise focus on fomenting a leaderless jihad in non-Muslim states. He believed that most jihadist organisations were not robust enough to withstand a serious counter-offensive. Inspiring attacks in non-Muslims countries was a way of rebuilding momentum. Because jihadist leaders could not provide direct guidance for specific operations, al-Suri also emphasised the importance of ideological indoctrination as a way to ensure at least some level of influence. New communications technologies have not only enabled jihadists to inspire individuals in non-Muslim countries, but also to provide them direct guidance in some instances. This has collapsed the space between the global and the local, helping to make al-Suri's strategic theory a reality.\n\nThe process of online radicalisation is similar to radicalisation in any closed environment, but new technologies have made it faster and more far-reaching. Social-media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube offer anyone -- including jihadists -- the opportunity to convey messages to would-be supporters around the world. These platforms are also easier to use, and to use pseudonymously, than password protect jihadist websites and chat rooms. This enables reaching a much larger pool of people. The algorithms on which social media platforms function also connect users to content that resonates with them, meaning that these platforms help do the work of finding potential recruits and supporters. Moreover, it is possible for these individuals to connect directly with credible figures, be they clerics or fighters in a conflict zone.\n\nHistorically, popular support for a terrorist or insurgent group has been characterised as active or passive. Active supporters are willing to risk personal harm or make other types of sacrifices either by joining an insurgent group or movement, or providing material assistance such as money, shelter, weapons or other supplies, intelligence, and medical aid. Passive supporters sympathise with a group's cause and probably will not betray its members or active supporters, but they stop short of joining up, providing material assistance, or otherwise acting on behalf of the group or movement in question.\n\nThis dichotomy remains valid for assessing and describing supporters on the ground where a violent extremist organisation operates. However, the rise of social media has created new ways for people to support an extremist cause without executing or supporting attacks, donating money, or otherwise engaging in traditional supportive activities. Instead, social media users can amplify a group's message or behaviour, helping with fundraising, radicalisation, and recruitment by uploading content on the Internet or even just clicking the retweet button. Moreover, online radicalisation may occur thousands of miles away from where a conflict is taking place, or right in the heart of it. The growing number of individuals becoming radicalised online in the West understandably receives a lot of attention. Another growing phenomenon is the increase in Internet-based radicalisation in places -- such as Afghanistan, India, and Kenya -- where jihadist groups traditionally recruited through more traditional means.\n\nAs social media companies have cracked down, jihadists increased their use of encrypted messaging platforms. Talent-spotters operating on publicly visible social-media sites connect with potential recruits, and then steer them toward end-to-end encryption, which is often inaccessible to governments. According to FBI Director Christopher Wray, the FBI was unable to access the content of 7,775 devices in fiscal year 2017: that is more than half of those it attempted to access in that year. As the Bipartisan Policy Center assessed in a report on digital counterterrorism, \""[b]y toggling between publicly visible social media and encrypted messaging applications, terrorist recruiters can share their message with a vast global audience and then communicate securely with individuals lured in by that public outreach.\""\n\nIn addition to facilitating the radicalisation and mobilisation of new supporters, end-to-end encryption also enables jihadists to engage in operational plotting. The Islamic State also used end-to-end encryption to pioneer a \""virtual-planner model,\"" in which its operatives provided guidance to inspired individuals, like Mohammed Yazdani, on how to conduct attacks halfway across the world. This guidance has been relevant for everything from conceiving plots to selecting targets to building bombs. In some cases, virtual planners helped operatives to troubleshoot during an attack, or overcoming last-minute nerves before executing one.\n\nNot all terrorist groups use social media equally. The core al-Qaeda organisation was eclipsed by its own affiliates. Al-Shabaab was an early adopter, especially of Twitter, which it used for everything from recruitment to fact-checking media when the group believed a story was misreported.\n\nAQAP was also more active on social media specifically, and the Internet in general than al-Qaeda core. The Islamic State has been the most prolific jihadist organisation, combining social media savvy with video production techniques to produce propaganda that helped attract record number of foreign fighters.\n\nAt the same time, the group also adopted elements of al-Suri's strategy, and called on its sympathisers who could not emigrate to undertake attacks in their home countries:\n\n\""If the infidels have shut the door of hijrah [travel to Syria and Iraq] in your faces, then open the door of jihad in theirs. Make your deed a source of their regret. Truly, the smallest act you do in their lands is more beloved to us than the biggest act done here [in Syria]; it is more effective for us and more harmful to them. If one of you wishes and strives to reach the lands of the Islamic State, then each of us wishes to be in your place to make examples of the crusaders, day and night, scaring them and terrorizing them until every neighbor fears his neighbor.\""\n\nThis strategy contributed to the high number of Islamic State attacks in the West after June 2014. The group was not the first jihadist organisation to adopt al-Suri's method of inspiring attacks abroad, while simultaneously pursuing Naji's strategy of seizing territory at home. AQAP had pursued a similar course of action, with Anwar al-Awlaki and the Inspire magazine he produced, rousing adherents to action. However, once again, the Islamic State was considerably more prolific. As Kim Cragin pointed out in the Texas National Security Review earlier this year, the group conducted more external operations -- attacks conducted outside Syria, Iraq, or its 25 so-called provinces -- from 2015 to 2017 than the al-Qaeda network did during a similar period from 2008 to 2010. She further highlighted that the Islamic State's \""inspired\"" operations made up a considerable proportion of the total number of the total.\n\nNo one could have predicted that a Tunisian street vendor setting himself on fire would spark a conflagration that consumed much of the Arab world.\n\nNor could anyone have foreseen that a former soccer enthusiast in Iraq, who had done time in a US-administered prison camp, would command the most powerful jihadist group the world had ever seen and declare himself the leader of the Caliphate.\n\nWhat analysts can do is to identify trends. Insurgents have long sought to influence adherents and potential supporters, including through governance and the use of propaganda. The ways in which jihadist groups have adopted and adapted these practices, especially in terms of their ability to use new technologies, are trends we cannot ignore. So what can we do?\n\nThe international community has scored significant victories against the Islamic State, severely degraded core al-Qaeda, kept AQAP contained, and disrupted other terrorist groups across the world. And yet, despite nearly two decades of US-led counterterrorism operations, the Center for Strategic and International Studies recently found that there are almost four times as many Sunni Islamist militants operating in 2018 as there were on 9/11.\n\nOne way of making sense of this is to posit that terrorist organisations have been weakened in the past several years, but that the wider jihadist movement remains strong. If one accepts this proposition, then it is impossible to ignore the fact that the movement's ongoing strength stems in large part from the fragile nature of the states in which the majority of its adherents operate. State fragility is rampant across parts of South and Central Asia, the Middle East, Horn of Africa, and Sahel, where governments lack legitimacy and fail to provide their citizens with adequate security or basic social services. Many of these governments are poorly run and corrupt, led by elites who are predatory and sometimes inclined toward authoritarian tendencies. Rule of law is often absent.\n\nFor years, the international community has sought to reduce these risk factors through various policies and programmes, but too often it has done so through a counterterrorism lens. Put another way, the aim has been to address these deficiencies in large part to reduce terrorism. Because terrorism prevention was the objective, this may have helped to engender tradeoffs that favored short-term solutions that relied more on the use of force. This has certainly been the case for the United States. There is another way of approaching the problem, however, and one that European countries advocate: viewing terrorism as just one negative outgrowth from fragile states (immigration flows is another), and focusing primarily on addressing the state fragility that is at the heart of these problems. This view merits consideration, and it is worth noting that the US Institute of Peace Task Force on Extremism in Fragile States has adopted elements of it.\n\nThe use of force still has a place in this approach. After all, security is critical for development and reform. And no country should be expected to allow looming threats to fester without addressing them. However, the international community, and especially the United States, which has been in the lead when it comes to building the security capacity of partner nations, can and should do more to ensure that force is used judiciously.\n\nExternal actors also must develop greater commonality in terms of envisioning terrorist threats and how to combat them, objectively assessing the potential for burden sharing, and making realistic approaches to improving efforts to shore up fragile states and combat terrorism in the Middle East, Africa, and South and Central Asia. Part of this effort includes identifying structural or political impediments to burden-sharing that cannot be overcome and therefore must be mitigated, as well as barriers that are worth attempting to surmount. It also requires building a community of interest among government officials and outside experts on how to improve state-to-state burden-sharing and incorporate it within the European Union, NATO, and the World Bank.\n\nA similar cooperative effort is needed to combat online radicalisation and the misuse of encrypted communications channels. There is no single policy fix when it comes to terrorists' use of technology. We need to think in terms of layered security, similar to the ways in which countries approach airport or homeland security. In this case, the need for public- private partnerships and international collaboration is even greater. Governments, multinational organisations and alliances, and the private sector must come together to create rules of the road. This means promoting national and global norms that balance security needs with individual privacy and freedom of expression. Put simply: better governance, on the ground and online, is critical to combatting jihadists locally and globally.\n\nFor example see: Letter from 'Atiyya (akak Mahmud) to Bin Laden, June 19, 2010, Government Exhibit 421-10-CR-019-S-4-RJD (Abbottabad document released at trial of Abid Naseer).\n\nMark Mazzetti, \""CIA Drone Is Said to Kill Al Qaeda's No. 2,\"" New York Times, August 27, 2011.\n\nSeth Jones, A Persistent Threat: The Evolution of al Qa'ida and Other Salafi Jihadists (Arlington, VA: RAND, 2014), x.\n\nLetter to Atiyya (Sheikh Mahmud) from Osama bin Laden (Abu Abdullah), April 26, 2011, SOCOM-2012-0000010.\n\nDaveed Gartenstein-Ross, \""The Cuban in the Desert,\"" Foreign Policy, August 13, 2013.\n\nOn Libya see, Mohammed Abbas, \""Libya Prisoner Release Stokes Fears of Tribal Strife,\"" Reuters, March 3, 2011.

As they are hunted on the shores of the Wild Goose Lake, Zhou must decide what he is willing to sacrifice both for this stranger and for the family he left behind. When the film debuted at Cannes this year, even Quentin Tarantineo queued up. The LA Times writes: \It's not often that you see a Cannes auteur checking out the competition. But Tarantino was clearly as eager as anyone to see 'The Wild Goose Lake,' an ultra-moody, hyper-violent gangland thriller from a rising talent named Diao Yinan, who won the top prize at the 2014 Berlin International Film Festival for his wintry noir 'Black Coal, Thin Ice.' The plot, artfully kinked with flashbacks, is often a fast-moving (and slow-moving) blur. There are brawls and decapitations, shootouts and impalings, plus one sad, fugitive moment of intimacy in a world where human relations are almost entirely transactional.\""\n\nReview by Stephen Tronicek\n\nThere's a shot near the beginning of Diao Yi'nan's The Wild Goose Lake that floats with ENTITY Liu (Lun-Mei Kwei) as she approaches the other protagonist Zenong Zhao (Ge Hu). It's a beautiful shot but there's something that seems off about it. The slow movement almost feels grating. The rhythm of it is uncomfortable, like it wants to go on long enough to become exasperating. This is how much of The Wild Goose Lake feels. As it's oppressive story plays out, a weight holds on your shoulders. Something about the rhythm is off. We're lost in the center of this story begging to be hypnotic but isn't. IT'S PERFECT.\n\nThe film feels like getting dragged through the muddy underbelly of beachside organized crime. Taking place in the Goose Lake District, the film follows Zenong Zhao as he attempts to escape the authorities. He's accidentally shot a police officer and now they're cleaning house. He approaches ENTITY Liu, a prostitute looking for her way out. Liu knows his wife and starts to assist Zhao in his escape. This puts them in contention with gang members, friends, and the cops.\n\nAll of this makes The Wild Goose Lake feel like a neo-noir with all the grunge put back in. Whereas many neo-noirs have now leaned on stylization, The Wild Goose Lake leans on realism. The result is a movie where all the violence, the suffering, becomes shockingly clear. Everybody is put through the wringer to the point that even the \""fun\"" violence (a head decapitation, murder by umbrella) hits with a poignancy a more flippant project would lose. It's a great balance of tone. Hopefully, all of this doesn't dissuade you from seeing The Wild Goose Lake. As difficult as it is to experience, it is an experience worth taking."

He is on the lookout for any brown slurry from the coal-washing facility of the sprawling mine nearby.\n\n\""Earlier they would discharge dirty water four times a week,\"" said the 28-year-old farmer, a member of India's Gond tribe. \""Now it's rare.\"" Driving this improvement are forest dwellers like him, who consistently monitor the coal mine for environmental violations.\n\nThe central state of Chhattisgarh produced the highest quantity of coal in India in the last financial year. Most of its mines are open-cast -- the ground on top has to be destroyed as the coal beneath is too shallow for underground mining. It leads to greater air pollution due to the blasting of land as well as loading and unloading of overburdened soil.\n\nThe mine adjoining Kariyam's village, named \""Parsa East and Kanta Basan,\"" is also open-cast. As the ground is dug up for the expanding project, forested areas are being threatened -- along with the homes they provided to tribal villagers.\n\nIndia's pollution control laws as well as approvals for coal mines mandate environmental preservation measures. But enforcement depends on self-monitoring by the miners and by state-level pollution control officers -- both of which are required to file six-monthly compliance reports.\n\nIn the case of the Parsa East and Kanta Basan mine, that owner is Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam (RRVUNL), a state-owned power generator and distribution utility. Under a nationalization law enacted in 1973, the Indian government owns the rights to all coal reserves in the country, and prime minister Narendra Modi's government has allocated 84 blocks to state-owned firms at cheap rates.\n\nRRVUNL, though, has outsourced all operations of Parsa East and Kanta Basan to the ENTITY, whose controversial environmental track record includes various investigations and local protests over alleged violations at its power plant and sea port projects.\n\nSkeptical, villagers who live around the Parsa East and Kanta Basan mine -- and are directly impacted by any pollution from it -- have begun actively monitoring the project. They were trained by members of Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan, a group that opposes coal mining in the Hasdeo Arand forest. The environmental rules governing the mine's operations are public, but they only existed in English. So the group translated them into Hindi, and taught the villagers how to monitor for violations and who reach out to if they discovered any.\n\nFor instance, the mine's coal washing facility is supposed to be a \""zero discharge unit.\"" The water used to clean the mined coal contains mud and other impurities, as well as small coal particles. It must not be released into the river stream, where the villagers bathe and their cattle drink water.\n\nNow, if Kariyam spots dirty water entering the stream, he records a video and sends it on WhatsApp to SK Verma, the regional officer of the Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board.\n\nThe community monitoring has proved to be a reasonably effective enforcement tool. Discharge from the washing facility into the river stream has been minimized, Kariyam says, though not fully eliminated. According to him, slurry is sometimes discharged under the cover of night.\n\nBut punitive action is rare; Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan has alleged corruption inside the government. \""I try to go when I receive complaints from villagers. There is no violation at the mine,\"" Verma said. He told Quartz that black-colored water results from \""coal transportation\"" nearby, not the coal washing facility, though regulations require coal to be transported using the rail line that extends up to the mine, and not on trucks.\n\nThe villagers lack the tools and training for more rigorous monitoring of air, water, and soil pollution, and they don't have the powers of a government monitor. \""We can't enter the mine area,\"" Kariyam says, \""so we can't monitor coal dump fires\"" -- spontaneous blazes, sparked when mounds of coal are left to accumulate heat, that emit pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.\n\nAnd though the villagers may have saved it from regular pollution, \""the Salhi river stream now almost dries up every summer because its catchment area has been occupied by the mine,\"" says Alok Shukla, co-organizer of Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan.\n\nThe stream faces an even more existential threat: Parsa, a new mine proposed near Parsa East and Kanta Basan. In the final stages of approval by the national government, Parsa is also owned by RRVUNL, and has already been contracted to ENTITY.\n\nWhen asked for comment, a spokesperson for ENTITY said questions should be directed to RRVUNL, the mine's owner. RRVUNL did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMining at Parsa will require the displacement of Kariyam and other residents of Salhi. ENTITY would give them resettlement options under state laws. But that solution is unacceptable to Kariyam: \""We will not move from our land. If they manage to get the final clearance, we will die before we are displaced"
Adani Group,0,"Related Story: Rail company snubs ENTITY's controversial mine, as another faces pressure to stay away\n\nLeaks from one of ENTITY's most significant contractors for its Carmichael coal mine, engineering firm GHD, show it has been rocked by internal dissent, with some current and former staff saying it went into \""crisis mode\"" after employees bombarded management with complaints and questions about its work on the mine.\n\nThe revelations show anti-ENTITY activists' tactic of targeting contractors could be making it difficult for ENTITY to find contractors to complete the mine.\n\nThey come as public pressure mounts on the company, with more than a dozen protests being held at GHD offices around Australia this week.\n\nThe ABC has spoken to two current senior engineers and one former GHD employee.\n\nThe ABC has also seen emails from management to staff responding to internal and external criticisms of GHD's work with ENTITY as well as a list of projects GHD has done for ENTITY.\n\nTwo senior engineers at GHD said the company went into crisis mode over internal unrest over GHD's involvement with ENTITY.\n\nThey said the issue dominated water-cooler discussions for weeks and was unique over at least the past 15 years, with no other issue causing as much concern for GHD staff.\n\nThey said the internal disquiet was triggered first by protests outside GHD events and offices in March and then amplified after charity Engineers Without Borders terminated a long-standing partnership between it and GHD over the firm's work for ENTITY's Carmichael coal mine in August.\n\nOver that period, many staff emailed management with their concerns. In response, GHD held town-hall meetings in offices around the country, with hundreds of employees attending and meetings reaching room capacities.\n\nGHD staff told the ABC the meetings were polite but probing, with the majority of questions in some cities raising concern about GHD's work with ENTITY.\n\nOther staff also met with GHD managers behind closed doors to express their concern.\n\nThe current and former GHD employees told the ABC the company did not have a culture in which complaints were regularly voiced, and it took a lot for staff to raise their concerns.\n\nEmails seen by the ABC appear to confirm the staff account, showing GHD began an information campaign to address staff concerns about GHD's work with ENTITY.\n\nIn March 2019, a GHD manager emailed staff saying the company could confirm it had done some work on the mine in the past.\n\n\""If GHD were to be doing any ongoing work with this client, we would not be able to confirm or deny our involvement for confidentiality reasons,\"" the manager said.\n\nIn July, an all-staff email from GHD noted: \""Many of you have put questions to the leadership team about GHD's position in this debate.\""\n\nAddressing concerns that had been raised, GHD said: \""We are consultants, and we don't create policy or source business on a policy-driven agenda.\n\n\""Being targeted by activists should not deter GHD from doing what we believe in.\""\n\nIn a further attempt to quell disquiet, GHD held forums at offices around the country and conducted a staff survey.\n\nIn an all-staff email, a GHD manager noted the company had received a lot of responses:\n\n\""And regardless of the diverse mix of positions held, personally I'm incredibly proud that our people clearly care deeply about both the brand and future of our company as well as our role and responsibility in shaping and caring for the world we live in. And I'm also delighted that you feel comfortable to share and discuss this sensitive and complex topic in an open, transparent and respectful manner.\""\n\nGHD staff that spoke with the ABC said colleagues at the meetings did not appear convinced by the company's arguments, but did appreciate the chance to discuss the issues with their bosses.\n\nThe internal emails repeatedly told staff not to confirm or deny whether GHD was working with ENTITY on the Carmichael mine.\n\n\""Regarding any protest activity, please remember that we are not able to comment about projects or confirm or deny the identity of current clients. We respect client confidentiality at all times,\"" a July email from the company's CEO said.\n\nBut as the complaints and protests continued, GHD published a statement about the issue in August, downplaying the company's involvement in the mine.\n\nIn a series of internal questions and answers, the company asked: \""Is GHD designing or constructing ENTITY's Carmichael Coal Mine?\""\n\nIn its answer, GHD said it, \""can confirm that we are not responsible for the design of mine site infrastructure\"".\n\nBut internal documents seen by the ABC suggest that statement downplays the significant work GHD has done designing central aspects of the mine.\n\nA list of projects GHD has worked on for ENTITY on an internal GHD register shows one project called \""Underground Boxcut Design\"".\n\nA 'box cut' is the first excavation step of a mine. It removes the weathered top layer of earth, allowing further excavation to reach the coal.\n\nThat excavation is as far as ENTITY is allowed to go before obtaining further environment approvals.\n\nThe description of the project said: \""Underground boxcut design for the ENTITY Carmichael Mine.\""\n\nIt said the design involved a 75m box cut, and the removal 8.4 million cubic metres of material -- enough to fill more than 3,000 Olympic swimming pools.\n\nA spokeswoman for ENTITY Mining told the ABC that if the design work was done, it was for an outdated mine design.\n\n\""Any GHD design documents related to mine site design are outdated and related to old design concepts that are not being implemented.\""\n\nThe document shows GHD had a number of staff seconded to ENTITY, with those employees sometimes working from ENTITY offices.\n\nGHD declined to comment on the matter further, pointing the ABC to its public statement.\n\nThe revelations come just weeks after another contractor and major engineering firm, Cardno, announced it would not continue working on the Carmichael mine, partly because of the \""polarising\"" effect the work was having on its employees.\n\nThat news followed engineering firm Aurecon severing all ties with ENTITY in March this year as part of plans to be a \""future ready business\"" -- a move that led to Resources Minister Matt Canavan labelling it \""a bunch of bed-wetters\"".\n\nYet another ENTITY contractor and engineering firm, AECOM, took ENTITY to court this year, chasing more than $12 million for work it did on a rail link to the Carmichael mine.\n\nThe Queensland Resources Council declined to comment for this story, instead pointing the ABC to comments it made in September.\n\n\""The activists will stop at nothing to destroy jobs,\"" QRC chief Ian Macfarlane told the ABC in September.\n\n\""My advice to companies is to show some courage and to be aware that the activists are trying to infiltrate your organisations and make sure that your own IP [intellectual property] and the security systems you run are up to scratch.\""\n\nThat month, amid news of some engineering contractors pulling out of the Carmichael project, the Queensland Resources Council indicated mining companies might blacklist those companies.\n\n\""Resources companies simply can't be expected to partner with fair-weather friends or businesses who let activists call the shots,\"" Mr Macfarlane said in a press release.\n\nENTITY Mining told the ABC it would not be intimidated by activists.\n\n\""After more than eight years of working on our project, we have repeatedly demonstrated that we will not be intimidated or deterred from delivering on our promises to Queenslanders and we continue to get on with the construction of the Carmichael Project,\"" a spokeswoman for ENTITY Mining said.\n\n\""We are very pleased with the contractors that we already have in place, and confident with the knowledge that we have plenty of others chasing our business on future work packages should we need them,\"" she said.\n\nThe anti-coal activists initially focused on banks, campaigning for them to rule out financing ENTITY's Carmichael project.\n\nAll four of Australia's major banks have ruled out working with ENTITY on the Carmichael project, and ENTITY has said it will rely on other companies in the ENTITY for finance.\n\nActivists have now been focusing on contractors ENTITY will need to finish the design of the mine and to build it.\n\nActivist group Market Forces has been among the leading organisations in that campaign.\n\n\""We try to really highlight to the contractors the reputational risk of being involved in a massive new coal project in the midst of a climate crisis,\"" Market Forces campaigner Pablo Brait said.\n\nThe group has targeted GHD employees on LinkedIn with campaign information and surveys.\n\n\""We don't think any company that sees itself as a forward-thinking or ethical company should be going anywhere near the ENTITY Carmichael project,\"" Mr Brait said.\n\nGHD has been working with ENTITY on the Carmichael mine since at least 2010, when it provided ENTITY with an \""initial advice statement\"" on the proposed mine, after it purchased the project from Linc Energy.\n\nIn 2013, GHD wrote the key Environmental Impact Statement for the mine-and-rail project for the Queensland state government approvals.\n\nIn there, GHD estimated the mine would generate more than 10,000 jobs for Queensland in some years -- a figure that was later disputed in court by an economic consultant employed by ENTITY.\n\nGHD declined to comment on its work with ENTITY, or related issues. Instead, it referred the ABC to its public statement.\n\nIn that statement, GHD argued coal was an important resource for developing countries and emphasised the work GHD did on renewable energy projects.\n\n\""We work professionally to apply scientific and engineering knowledge to support our clients, whose operations in turn have to meet commercial, environmental and regulatory requirements.\n\n\""Our commitment and contribution to sustainable progress is to provide professional, honest and evidence-based advice to all our clients in all sectors, always within the laws and regulations that apply to them and to our own operations."

She has been lodged in Tihar jail in Aviation scandal dating back to 2008-09. She is also facing charges of an alleged violation of foreign exchange rules by NGO Advantage India.\n\nThe aviation scandal pertains to former civil aviation minister Praful Patel decision to give air traffic rights for foreign private airlines at the cost of national carrier Air India. Corporate lobbyist Deepak Talwar, who was extradited from Dubai in January, had received Rs 272 crore in bribes while acting as a middleman and liaising with several government functionaries to illegally secure favourable air traffic rights for foreign private airlines.\n\nKapoor has been involved in laundering the ill-gotten money of Talwar in non-government and private organizations. She owns Stone Travels Pvt Ltd. Her company received $ 235,120 from Gilt Asset Management Ltd, one of eight offshore companies of Talwar, during 2010-2011 and 2011- 2012. The investigative agencies have found that out of Rs 272 crore kickbacks, Rs 144 crore was received by Gilt Asset Management.\n\nInterestingly, Kapoor's residence on APJ Abdul Kalam road was owned by Gulshan Promoters Pvt Ltd, one of whose promoters, Devendra Dogra had received $3.765 million from Gilt Asset Management, Enforcement Directorate has found during the probe.\n\nFurther, it was also found that Dogra and Neel Patnakar, the shareholders of Gulshan Promoters, transferred their shareholding in Gulshan Promoters to Sunrise Trust, in which Kapoor and her daughters Karina and Yamini Kapoor were the beneficial owners. Dogra, Kapoor and Talwar have been trustees of Sunrise Trust. Kapoor has been a director in Gulshan Promoters from 2001 to 2018.\n\nShe is also facing charges of an alleged violation of foreign exchange rules by NGO Advantage India. The Delhi-based NGO Advantage India, its owner Talwar, Kapoor and four others, are accused for of misusing Rs 90.72 crore donations from two defence and aviation firms -- MBDA and Airbus SAS.\n\nIt is alleged that France-based Airbus SAS and UK-based missile manufacturer MBDA International gave about Rs 90.72 crore to the NGO for initiatives related to healthcare and education but the money was later found to have been used for purchasing properties.\n\nThe Advantage India flouting several provisions of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), including \""false statements, false accounts, claimed bogus expenses, furnished concocted vouchers, purchased three luxury cars over Rs 84 lakh, payment made by NGO for foreign visits of Talwar, funds used for making payment related to business activities of the founder of Advantage India.\n\nIn 2015, Talwar transferred the Directorship of Advantage India to his wife, Deepa, but didn't intimate the Ministry about the change in violation of Rule 17A of the FCRA.\n\nWho is Madi Sharma?\n\nA UK-based Sharma organised an unofficial visit of Members of European Parliament (MEPs) to Jammu and Kashmir. Amazingly, it was an all-paid VIP trip.\n\nShe represented herself as head of an organization called Women's Economic and Social Think Tank (WESTT), which worked with the European Parliament and governments and non-governmental organizations across the world. She had written invitations to select Members of the European Parliament, telling them that she was organising a prestigious VIP meeting with the Prime Minister of India.\n\nShe told the small group of European politicians that they will be on a three-day visit to India wherein they will meet Prime Minister and next day will visit Kashmir. She had clearly mentioned it is a sponsored trip by the International Institute for Non-Aligned Studies.\n\nIt was also found that she founded and runs Madi Group, which is a group of the international private sector, not-for-profit companies and NGOs and has authored a book titled \""Madi No Excuses!\"" She also claims of working in India and across Europe with businesses and governments.\n\nThe visit has stirred a major controversy as Opposition parties have attacked the government, questioning why Indian parliamentarians are being denied permission to visit Kashmir when foreign MPs are allowed to go there. Further, they demanded an answer from the government about Madi Sharma's profile. She earned a name in the list of women corporate movers in India.\n\nWho is Sonia Dhawan?\n\nTwo months ago, Sonia Dhawan, the former Paytm executive and the prime accused in an alleged extortion case involving the company's founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma, joined back ENTITY. She joined Paytm First Games in September this year. Gamepind Entertainment, which owns Paytm First Games, is a joint venture between Alibaba's AGTech and Paytm's parent One97 Communications.\n\nEarlier, she was a former vice president of communications and public relations at Paytm and had spent nearly five months in jail after Ajay Shekhar Sharma, senior vice-president of the company and the founder's brother, lodged an FIR against her.\n\nShe along with three other accused were alleged to have stolen private data belonging to Sharma and tried to extort Rs 10 crore.\n\nDhawan, however, claimed innocence and said that she never indulged in any illegal activity, or secretly obtained data from any laptop or indulged in blackmail.\n\nIn June, Dhawan had joined as director of corporate communications at Sheroes, an online community and job portal for women, where Paytm's chief Sharma was an investor and a board member.\n\nSources said that she holds a major share in the Patym group and this has led to the case against her the majority stakeholder.\n\nWho is Honeypreet Insan?\n\nHoneypreet Insan, the adopted daughter of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim, was behind bars in 2017 Panchkula violence case. She got bail in the case on Wednesday and was released late evening. Last week, she also got relief when sedition charges against her were dropped in connection with the violence following the conviction of the Dera chief in rape cases.\n\nThe Panchkula police had booked Honeypreet and other Dera followers on the charges of sedition and criminal conspiracy in connection with the Panchkula violence case. Honeypreet, along with others, was named in the FIR for allegedly conspiring to incite violence in Panchkula that broke out following the conviction of the Dera head in August 2017.\n\nHer real name is Priyanka Taneja and she has risen in Rahim's influence in the sect, so much so, that people took her words to be Rahim's decisions.

Gupta later in 2011 approached the court and alleged an illicit relationship between Ram Rahim and his wife Honeypreet. Honeypreet and Gupta then got separated and she started living in the Dera.\n\nIt is also alleged that Honeypreet had conspired to prevent his son Jasneet Insan from succeeding as Dera chief. Jasneet Insan is the son of now jailed Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim with his wife Harjeet Kaur. Also Honeypreet and Rahim shut his son Jasneet's business and let his 'adopted daughter' re-launch the same as a modified brand in 2016.

The investigative agencies has found that out of Rs 272 crore kickbacks, Rs 144 crore was received by Gilt Asset Management.\n\nInterestingly, Kapoor's residence on APJ Abdul Kalam road was owned by Gulshan Promoters Pvt Ltd, one of whose promoters, Devendra Dogra had received $3.765 million from Gilt Asset Management, Enforcement Directorate has found during probe.\n\nFurther it was also found that Dogra and Neel Patnakar, the shareholders of Gulshan Promoters, transferred their shareholding in Gulshan Promoters to Sunrise Trust, in which Kapoor and her daughters Karina and Yamini Kapoor were the beneficial owners. Dogra, Kapoor and Talwar have been trustees of Sunrise Trust. Kapoor has been a director in Gulshan Promoters from 2001 to 2018.\n\nShe is also facing charges of an alleged violation of foreign exchange rules by NGO Advantage India. The Delhi-based NGO Advantage India, its owner Talwar, Kapoor and four others, are accused for of misusing Rs 90.72 crore donations from two defence and aviation firms -- MBDA and Airbus SAS.\n\nIt is alleged that France-based Airbus SAS and UK-based missile manufacturer MBDA International gave about Rs 90.72 crore to the NGO for initiatives related to healthcare and education but the money was later found to have been used for purchasing properties.\n\nThe Advantage India flouting several provisions of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), including \""false statements, false accounts, claimed bogus expenses, furnished concocted vouchers, purchased three luxury cars over Rs 84 lakh, payment made by NGO for foreign visits of Talwar, funds used for making payment related to business activities of the founder of Advantage India.\n\nIn 2015, Talwar transferred the Directorship of Advantage India to his wife, Deepa, but didn't intimate the Ministry about the change in violation of Rule 17A of the FCRA.\n\nWho is Madi Sharma?\n\nA UK-based Sharma organised an unofficial visit of Members of European Parliament (MEPs) to Jammu and Kashmir. Amazingly, it was all-paid VIP trip.\n\nShe represented herself as head of an organization called Women's Economic and Social Think Tank (WESTT), which worked with the European Parliament and governments and non-governmental organizations across the world. She had written invitations to select Members of the European Parliament, telling them that she was organising a prestigious VIP meeting with the Prime Minister of India.\n\nShe told the small group of European politicians that they will be on a three-day visit to India wherein they will meet Prime Minister and next day will visit Kashmir. She had clearly mentioned it is a sponsored trip by the International Institute for Non-Aligned Studies.\n\nIt was also found that she founded and runs Madi Group, which is a group of the international private sector, not-for-profit companies and NGOs and has authored a book titled \""Madi No Excuses!\"" She also claims of working in India and across Europe with businesses and governments.\n\nThe visit has stirred a major controversy as Opposition parties have attacked the government, questioning why Indian parliamentarians are being denied permission to visit Kashmir when foreign MPs are allowed to go there. Further, they demanded answer from the government about Madi Sharma's profile. She earned a name in the list of women corporate movers in India.\n\nWho is Sonia Dhawan?\n\nTwo months ago, Sonia Dhawan, the former ENTITY executive and the prime accused in an alleged extortion case involving the company's founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma, joined back ENTITY. She joined Paytm First Games in September this year. Gamepind Entertainment, which owns Paytm First Games, is a joint venture between Alibaba's AGTech and Paytm's parent One97 Communications.\n\nEarlier, she was a former vice president of communications and public relations at Paytm and had spent nearly five months in jail after Ajay Shekhar Sharma, senior vice-president of the company and the founder's brother, lodged an FIR against her.\n\nShe along with three other accused were alleged to have stolen private data belonging to Sharma and tried to extort Rs 10 crore.\n\nDhawan however claimed innocenceand said that she never indulged in any illegal activity, or secretly obtained data from any laptop or indulged in blackmail.\n\nIn June, Dhawan had joined as director of corporate communications at Sheroes, an online community and job portal for women, where Paytm's chief Sharma was an investor and a board member.\n\nSources said that she holds a major share in the Patym group and this has led to case against her the majority stake holder.\n\nWho is Honeypreet Insan?\n\nHoneypreet Insan, the adopted daughter of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim, was behind bars in 2017 Panchkula violence case. She got bail in the case on Wednesday and was released late evening. Last week, she also got relief when sedition charges against her were dropped in connection with the violence following the conviction of the Dera chief in rape cases.\n\nThe Panchkula police had booked Honeypreet and other Dera followers on the charges of sedition and criminal conspiracy in connection with the Panchkula violence case. Honeypreet, along with others, was named in the FIR for allegedly conspiring to incite violence in Panchkula that broke out following the conviction of the Dera head in August 2017.\n\nHer real name is Priyanka Taneja and she has risen in Rahim's influence in the sect, so much so, that people took her words to be Rahim's decisions. She has also acted, edited and directed movies on Ram Rahim. She acted in 'MSG 2 -The Messenger' and later had a special appearance in 'MSG-The Warrior Lion Heart'.\n\nShe was married to an old Dera follower, Vishwas Gupta on February 14, 1999. Gupta later in 2011 approached the court and alleged an illicit relationship between Ram Rahim and his wife Honeypreet. Honeypreet and Gupta then got separated and she started living in the Dera.\n\nIt is also alleged that Honeypreet had conspired to prevent his son Jasneet Insan from succeeding as Dera chief. Jasneet Insan is the son of now jailed Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim with his wife Harjeet Kaur. Also Honeypreet and Rahim shut his son Jasneet's business and let his 'adopted daughter' re-launch the same as a modified brand in 2016. Rahim and his son were directors in Posh Real Estate Pvt Ltd and Sat Fruits and Refer Pvt Ltd, but resigned later. Other prominent companies include Glorious Immigration Consultants Pvt Ltd, Hakikat Entertainment Pvt Ltd, MSG Tech Communication Pvt Ltd, and MSG Electric System Pvt Ltd.\n\nWho is Indrani Mukerjea?\n\nThe news about a socialite killing of her daughter left the country in shock. INX Media's jailed co-founder Indrani Mukerjea, wife of businessman Peter Mukerjea, had killed her daughter Sheena Bora. Not only that she climbing the corporate ladder using all illegal means. She violated law to get foreign money through Foreign Direct Investment without permission and that has landed a former Finance Minister -- P. Chidamabaram -- in jail for allegedly partnering her in the crime.\n\nCurrently, she is lodged in Tihar jail. She is now the prime witness in the case against Congress politician P. Chidambaram and his son Karti Chidambaram. The case pertains to alleged irregularities in government clearance given to INX Media to receive foreign investment to the tune of Rs 403.07 crore in 2007, when the senior Chidambaram was finance minister.\n\nHer testimony together with her husband and INX Media co-founder Peter Mukerjea, is in jail for the alleged murder of her daughter Sheena Bora, has led to P. Chidambaram behind bars. P. Chidambaram was arrested on August 21 in connection with the case.\n\nShe has become the new age the fall story of woman corporate movers."

Al Fawwaz,1,"Home\Commentary\""The Truth About Muhammad That Ignorant Americans Need To Know Commentary The Truth About Muhammad That Ignorant Americans Need To Know The Washington Standard 2019-11-08 The Washington Standard / November 8, 2019 1 Shares Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp\n\nThe Qur'an and Islamic tradition are clear: Muhammad is the supreme example of behavior for Muslims to follow. His importance to hundreds of millions of Muslims worldwide is rooted in the Qur'an, the Muslim holy book. In brief, he is \""an excellent model of conduct\"" (Qur'an 33:21). He demonstrates \""an exalted standard of character\"" (68:4), and indeed, \""he who obeys the Messenger [Muhammad], obeys Allah\"" (4:80). The Qur'an frequently tells Muslims to obey Allah and Muhammad: while the Muslim holy book takes for granted that Muhammad is fallible (cf. 48:2; 80:1-12), it also instructs Muslims repeatedly to obey Muhammad (3:32; 3:132; 4:13; 4:59; 4:69; 5:92; 8:1; 8:20; 8:46; 9:71; 24:47; 24:51; 24:52; 24:54; 24:56; 33:33; 47:33; 49:14; 58:13; 64:12).\n\nAny devout Muslim will take this seriously. Muqtedar Khan of the Center for the Study of Islam and Democracy explains:\n\nNo religious leader has as much influence on his followers as does Muhammad (Peace be upon him) the last Prophet of Islam....And Muhammad as the final messenger of God enjoys preeminence when it comes to revelation - the Qur'an - and traditions. So much so that the words, deeds and silences (that which he saw and did not forbid) of Muhammad became an independent source of Islamic law. Muslims, as a part of religious observance, not only obey, but also seek to emulate and imitate their Prophet in every aspect of life. Thus Muhammad is the medium as well as a source of the divine law.[1]\n\nPedophile Prophet\n\nAccording to ahadith reported by Bukhari, the Prophet of Islam \""married Aisha when she was a girl of six years of age, and he consumed [i.e., consummated] that marriage when she was nine years old.\""[2] He was at this time in his early fifties. Many Islamic apologists claim - in the teeth of this evidence - that Aisha was actually older. Karen Armstrong asserts that \""Tabari says that she was so young that she stayed in her parents' home and the marriage was consummated there later when she had reached puberty.\""[3] Unfortunately, her readers are unlikely to have volumes of Tabari on hand to check her assertion; contrary to Armstrong's account, the Muslim historian quotes Aisha thusly: \""The Messenger of God married me when I was seven; my marriage was consummated when I was nine.\""[4]\n\nHowever, other Muslim spokesmen acknowledge what the records say. Islamic scholar Muhammad Ali Al-Hanooti said that Muhammad's marriage to Aisha was the will of Allah, and \""Allah usually is not the one who we are allowed to argue with for any ordinance or commandment. The Qur'an says, 'He is not questioned for what He does, but they (people) are questioned for what they do.' Aisha got married when she was nine, when the Prophet (SAAWS) died, she was nineteen....What is wrong in her marriage of six or nine or whatsoever?\""[5]\n\nChild marriages were common in seventh-century Arabia. It is noteworthy that there is no record in the Qur'an or Hadith of Muhammad having to defend his marriage to Aisha- in sharp contrast to his obvious defensiveness over his marriage to his former daughter-in-law, Zaynab bint Jahsh. Moreover, the Qur'an describes a culture in which child marriage is taken for granted. In its directives about the waiting period required in order to determine if one's wife is pregnant before divorcing her, it says: \""If you are in doubt concerning those of your wives who have ceased menstruating, know that their waiting period shall be three months. The same shall apply to those who have not yet menstruated\"" (Qur'an 65:4, emphasis added). In this revelation Allah envisions a scenario in which a pre-pubescent woman is not only married, but also divorced by her husband.\n\nThe Ayatollah Khomeini married a ten-year-old girl when he was twenty-eight.[6] Khomeini called marriage to a prepubescent girl \""a divine blessing,\"" and advised the faithful: \""Do your best to ensure that your daughters do not see their first blood in your house.\""[7]\n\nTime Magazine reported in 2001: \""In Iran the legal age for marriage is nine for girls, fourteen for boys. The law has occasionally been exploited by pedophiles, who marry poor young girls from the provinces, use and then abandon them. In 2000 the Iranian Parliament voted to raise the minimum age for girls to fourteen, but this year, a legislative oversight body dominated by traditional clerics vetoed the move. An attempt by conservatives to abolish Yemen's legal minimum age of fifteen for girls failed, but local experts say it is rarely enforced anyway. (The onset of puberty is considered an appropriate time for a marriage to be consummated.)\""[8]\n\nThe United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reports that over half of the girls in Afghanistan and Bangladesh are married before they reach the age of eighteen.[9] In early 2002, researchers in refugee camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan found half the girls married by age thirteen. In an Afghan refugee camp, more than two out of three second-grade girls were either married or engaged, and virtually all the girls who were beyond second grade were already married. One ten-year-old was engaged to a man of sixty.[10]\n\nThis is the price that women have paid throughout Islamic history, and continue to pay, for Muhammad's status as \""an excellent example of conduct\"" (Qur'an 33:21).\n\nMisogynist\n\nMuhammad had many wives; lists vary but usually include eleven to thirteen women. Islamic tradition invests him with superhuman prowess: \""Gabriel brought a kettle from which I ate,\"" he says, \""and I was given the power of sexual intercourse equal to forty men.\""[11] Contemporary Islamic apologists assert, in contrast, that his many marriages were matters not of lust but of cementing political alliances. One Muslim biographer of the Prophet of Islam surveys the circumstances of each of his marriages and concludes: \""Thus do we see that each of these marriages had some solid reasons behind it; passion and lust were not among them.\""[12] While it is impossible to determine such a thing, there is no doubt that the laws Muhammad laid down for women have given them numerous disadvantages in Islamic societies to this day.\n\nThe Qur'an likens a woman to a field (tilth), to be used by a man as he wills: \""Your women are a tilth for you (to cultivate) so go to your tilth as ye will\"" (2:223). It declares that a woman's testimony is worth half that of a man: \""Get two witnesses, out of your own men, and if there are not two men, then a man and two women, such as ye choose, for witnesses, so that if one of them errs, the other can remind her\"" (2:282). It allows men to marry up to four wives, and have sex with slave girls (\""captives that your right hands possess\"") also: \""If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, marry women of your choice, two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice\"" (4:3).\n\nThe Qur'an also rules that a son's inheritance should be twice the size of a daughter's: \""Allah (thus) directs you as regards your children's (inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females\"" (4:11). Worst of all, it tells husbands to beat their disobedient wives: \""Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women). So good women are the obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded. As for those from whom ye fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and scourge them\"" (4:34).\n\nMuhammad also says that hell will be filled with more women than men: \""O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women)....You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you.\""[13]\n\nWith statements like these from the Qur'an and Muhammad, it is no wonder that women in the Islamic world suffer such inequalities.\n\nDraconian Punishments\n\nTwo stiff penalties -- stoning for adultery and amputation for theft -- define Islamic Sharia law for many Westerners, and indeed, they are emblematic of its pre-Medieval harshness and unsuitability for the contemporary world. However, making inroads against them as core elements of Sharia law will be difficult.\n\nFamously, Muhammad challenged the Jews for concealing the penalty of stoning for adultery in the Torah. Islamic apologists in the West like to point out that the Qur'an does not contain this command. It only commands lashes for stoning: \""The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication, flog each of them with a hundred stripes. Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment\"" (24:2). Allah also directs that adulterous women be confined to their homes until they die: \""If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, take the evidence of four (reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way\"" (Qur'an 4:15).\n\nThese punishments are harsh enough, but at least they seem to hold out some hope that the traditional Islamic penalty of stoning for adultery, which is still carried out in states that enforce Sharia in its fullness, can be mitigated. However, that hope is illusory. The Hadith says that there is more to the story. According to Umar, the Qur'an originally contained a verse enjoining stoning for adultery, but it was inadvertently dropped:\n\nAllah sent Muhammad with the Truth and revealed the Book (the Qur'an) to him, and among what Allah revealed, was the Verse of the Rajm (the stoning of married person -- male and female) who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and we did recite this Verse and understood and memorized it. Allah's Messenger did carry out the punishment of stoning and so did we after him.\n\nI am afraid that after a long time has passed, somebody will say, \""By Allah, we do not find the Verse of the Rajm in Allah's Book,\"" and thus they will go astray by leaving an obligation which Allah has revealed. And the punishment of the Rajm is to be inflicted to any married person (male and female) who commits illegal sexual intercourse if the required evidence is available or there is conception or confession.[14]\n\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, for Islamic reformers to make headway against this when Umar specifically warns against them.\n\nThe penalty of amputation for theft is even more strongly attested, by a verse that remains in the Qur'an: \""As to the thief, male or female, cut off his or her hands: a punishment by way of example, from Allah, for their crime; and Allah is exalted in power\"" (5:38). The binding words of Allah, applicable then, now and forever.\n\nWarrior Prophet\n\nIbn Ishaq reports that Muhammad participated in twenty-seven battles (the parenthetical material beginning with \""T.\"" below refers to Tabari's version of the same material):\n\nThe apostle took part personally in twenty-seven (T. six) raids:\n\nWaddan which was the raid of al-Abwa'. Buwat in the direction of Radwa. 'Ushayra in the valley of Yanbu'. The first fight at Badr in pursuit of Kurz b. Jabir. The great battle of Badr in which God slew the chiefs of Quraysh (T. and their nobles and captured many). Banu Sulaym until he reached al-Kudr. Al-Sawiq in pursuit of Abu. Sufyan b. Harb (T. until he reached Qarqara al-Kudr). Ghatafan (T. towards Najd), which is the raid of Dhu Amarr. Bahran, a mine in the Hijaz (T. above al-Furu'). Hamra'u'l-Asad. Banu Nadir. Dhatu'l-Riqa' of Nakhl. The last battle of Badr. Dumatu'l-Jandal. Al-Khandaq. Banul Qurayza. Banu Lihyan of Hudhayl. Dhu Qarad. Banu'l-Mustaliq of Khuza'a. Al-Hudaybiya not intending to fight where the polytheists opposed his passage. Then he went on the accomplished pilgrimage. The occupation of... Mecca. Hunayn. Al-Ta'if. Tabuk.\n\nMuhammad himself fought in nine engagements: Badr; Uhud; al-Khandaq; Qurayza; al-Mustaliq; Khaybar; the occupation; Hunayn; and al-Ta'if.[15]\n\nHere again, Muhammad's example is normative. We have seen how jihadists today invoke Badr and Khaybar to exhort Muslims to fight according to the example of the Prophet. It is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain that Islam is a religion of peace when warfare and booty were among the chief preoccupations of the Prophet of Islam. Sincere Islamic reformers should confront these facts, instead of ignoring or glossing over them, and work to devise ways in which Muslims can retreat from the proposition that Muhammad's example is in all ways normative. If they do not do so, one outcome is certain: bloodshed perpetrated in the name of Islam and in imitation of its prophet will continue.\n\nRELATED: Senator Cory Booker: Human Trafficker\n\nIslamic Tolerance\n\nThe Qur'an says: \""Those who believe (in the Qur'an), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians, any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve\"" (2:62; cf. 5:69 and 22:17). Muslim spokesmen in the West like to quote such verses and to stress the commonality between Islam and Christianity -- and sometimes even between Islam and Judaism. They have painted an irenic picture of Islam's respect for its sister \""Abrahamic faiths\"" - and thereby have given many Jews and Christians confidence that Western countries can accept Muslim immigrants in large numbers without any significant disruptions to their pluralistic societies.\n\nThe preponderance of the testimony that the Prophet of Islam left in the Qur'an and Hadith favors not tolerance and harmony between Muslims and non-Muslims, but just the opposite. A fundamental component of the Qur'an's view of non-Muslims is the often repeated and implacable belief in its own absolute truth, admitting of no rival: \""The Religion before Allah is Islam\"" (3:19), or, as another translation has it, \""The only true faith in God's sight is Islam.\"" Most Jews and Christians (\""People of the Book\"") are wrongdoers: \""If only the People of the Book had faith, it were best for them: among them are some who have faith, but most of them are perverted transgressors\"" (Qur'an 3:110).\n\nAs we have seen, the Qur'an implies that Jews and Christians after the time of Muhammad are renegades who have rejected his prophethood out of corruption and malice. Muhammad weaves his charges against Jews and Christians together by condemning Christians for believing that Jesus was crucified, and Jews for believing that they crucified him: \""They said (in boast), 'We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah'; but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not\"" (Qur'an 4:157).\n\nThe idea that Jews and Christians are accursed recurs several times in the Qur'an. Both have rejected Allah and his messenger Muhammad:\n\nAllah did aforetime take a covenant from the Children of Israel....But because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them, and made their hearts grow hard; they change the words from their (right) places and forget a good part of the message that was sent them....From those, too, who call themselves Christians, We did take a covenant, but they forgot a good part of the message that was sent them: so we estranged them, with enmity and hatred between the one and the other, to the day of judgment. (Qur'an 5:12-16)\n\nSo far is the Qur'an from modern notions of tolerance and peaceful coexistence that it even warns Muslims not to befriend Jews and Christians -- apparently including those who \""feel themselves subdued\"" and are paying the jiyza: \""O ye who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians for your friends and protectors. They are but friends and protectors to each other. And he amongst you that turns to them (for friendship) is of them. Verily Allah guideth not a people unjust.\"" (5:51).\n\nIt is ironic in light of all this that the Qur'an also criticizes Jews and Christians for being intolerant. Allah warns Muhammad that \""never will the Jews or the Christians be satisfied with thee unless thou follow their form of religion. Say: 'The Guidance of Allah, that is the (only) Guidance.' Wert thou to follow their desires after the knowledge which hath reached thee, then wouldst thou find neither Protector nor helper against Allah\"" (2:120; cf. 2:135).\n\nA hadith amplifies all this:\n\nOn the Day of Resurrection, a call-maker will announce, \""Let every nation follow that which they used to worship.\"" Then none of those who used to worship anything other than Allah like idols and other deities but will fall in Hell (Fire), till there will remain none but those who used to worship Allah, both those who were obedient (i.e. good) and those who were disobedient (i.e. bad) and the remaining party of the people of the Scripture. Then the Jews will be called upon and it will be said to them, 'Who do you use to worship?' They will say, 'We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.' It will be said to them, 'You are liars, for Allah has never taken anyone as a wife or a son. What do you want now?' They will say, 'O our Lord! We are thirsty, so give us something to drink.' They will be directed and addressed thus, 'Will you drink,' whereupon they will be gathered unto Hell (Fire) which will look like a mirage whose different sides will be destroying each other. Then they will fall into the Fire. Afterwards the Christians will be called upon and it will be said to them, 'Who do you use to worship?' They will say, 'We used to worship Jesus, the son of Allah.' It will be said to them, 'You are liars, for Allah has never taken anyone as a wife or a son,' Then it will be said to them, 'What do you want?' They will say what the former people have said. Then, when there remain (in the gathering) none but those who used to worship Allah (Alone, the real Lord of the Worlds) whether they were obedient or disobedient.[16]\n\nJesus will set things right at the end of the world. According to Islamic eschatology, he will return to end the dhimmi status of non-Muslims in Islamic societies -- not by initiating a new era of equality and harmony, but by abolishing Christianity and imposing Islam upon everyone. As Muhammad explained:\n\nBy Him in Whose Hands my soul is, surely (Jesus) the son of Mary will soon descend amongst you and will judge mankind justly (as a Just Ruler); he will break the Cross and kill the pigs and there will be no Jizya (i.e. taxation taken from non Muslims).[17]\n\nAnother hadith has Muhammad saying: \""How will you be when the son of Mary (i.e. Jesus) descends amongst you and he will judge people by the Law of the Qur'an and not by the law of Gospel.\""[18]\n\nThe Jews, meanwhile, will in the end times fare little better. Muhammad said: \""The last hour would not come unless the Muslims will fight against the Jews and the Muslims would kill them until the Jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say: Muslim, or the servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me; come and kill him.\""[19]\n\nCombine this stripping-away of all legitimacy from Judaism and Christianity with Muhammad's exhortations to fight against Jews and Christians, and it is no wonder that the Islamic world has been at odds with Jews and Christians through the centuries. As the schools of Islamic jurisprudence developed, they constructed upon these hadiths and passages of the Qur'an a legal structure for the treatment of non-Muslims. The features of this remained remarkably consistent across the centuries, and among all the legal schools. Consider the contemporary Saudi Sheikh Marzouq Salem Al-Ghamdi, who several years ago explained in a sermon the terms in which an Islamic society should tolerate the presence of non-Muslims in its midst:\n\nIf the infidels live among the Muslims, in accordance with the conditions set out by the Prophet -- there is nothing wrong with it provided they pay Jizya to the Islamic treasury. Other conditions are . . . that they do not renovate a church or a monastery, do not rebuild ones that were destroyed, that they feed for three days any Muslim who passes by their homes . . . that they rise when a Muslim wishes to sit, that they do not imitate Muslims in dress and speech, nor ride horses, nor own swords, nor arm themselves with any kind of weapon; that they do not sell wine, do not show the cross, do not ring church bells, do not raise their voices during prayer, that they shave their hair in front so as to make them easily identifiable, do not incite anyone against the Muslims, and do not strike a Muslim....If they violate these conditions, they have no protection.[20]\n\nIn this the Sheikh is merely repeating the classic terms of Islamic jurisprudence for the treatment of non-Muslims in Islamic societies - and he explicitly links these terms to Muhammad's example. We have already seen how insistent Muhammad was about the collection of the jizya. Meanwhile, the second-class status for Christians and Jews, mandated by Qur'an 9:29's stipulation that they \""feel themselves subdued,\"" was first fully articulated by Muhammad's lieutenant Umar during his caliphate (634 to 644), in terms strikingly similar to those used by Sheikh Marzouq. The Christians making this pact with Umar pledged:\n\nWe made a condition on ourselves that we will neither erect in our areas a monastery, church, or a sanctuary for a monk, nor restore any place of worship that needs restoration nor use any of them for the purpose of enmity against Muslims....We will not . . . prevent any of our fellows from embracing Islam, if they choose to do so. We will respect Muslims, move from the places we sit in if they choose to sit in them. We will not imitate their clothing, caps, turbans, sandals, hairstyles, speech, nicknames and title names, or ride on saddles, hang swords on the shoulders, collect weapons of any kind or carry these weapons.... We will not encrypt our stamps in Arabic, or sell liquor. We will have the front of our hair cut, wear our customary clothes wherever we are, wear belts around our waist, refrain from erecting crosses on the outside of our churches and demonstrating them and our books in public in Muslim fairways and markets. We will not sound the bells in our churches, except discreetly, or raise our voices while reciting our holy books inside our churches in the presence of Muslims. . . .\n\nAfter these and other rules are fully laid out, the agreement concludes: \""These are the conditions that we set against ourselves and followers of our religion in return for safety and protection. If we break any of these promises that we set for your benefit against ourselves, then our Dhimmah (promise of protection) is broken and you are allowed to do with us what you are allowed of people of defiance and rebellion.\""[21]\n\nEven today, although these laws are not fully in force in most countries in the Islamic world, Christians and other non-Muslims still face widespread discrimination and harassment. Robert Hussein Qambar Ali was a Kuwaiti who converted from Islam to Christianity in the 1990s. He was arrested and tried for apostasy, even though the Kuwaiti Constitution guarantees the freedom of religion and says nothing about the traditional Islamic prohibition on conversion to another faith, which, as we have seen, is rooted in the words and deeds of Muhammad. One of Hussein's prosecutors stated: \""With grief I have to say that our criminal law does not include a penalty for apostasy. The fact is that the legislature, in our humble opinion, cannot enforce a penalty for apostasy any more or less than what our Allah and his messenger have decreed. The ones who will make the decision about his apostasy are: our Book, the Sunna, the agreement of the prophets and their legislation given by Allah.\""[22]\n\nIt is nothing short of staggering that the myth of Islamic tolerance could have gained such currency in the teeth of Muhammad's open contempt and hatred for Jews and Christians, incitements of violence against them, and calls that they be converted or subjugated. While human nature is everywhere the same and Muslims can, of course, act as tolerantly as anyone else, the example of Muhammad, the highest model for human behavior, constantly pulls them in a different direction. The fact that Western analysts continue to ignore all this demonstrates the ease with which people can be convinced of something they wish to believe, regardless of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\n\nRELATED: A Seething, Pyschopolitical Hatred of Christianity\n\nImitating Muhammad today\n\nIt is certain that mujahedin throughout the world see Muhammad as the personification of the qualities they are trying to embody. His example cannot be limited to his kindness to his companions and lack of harshness to his servants. When Muslims look to imitate him, they look to the same sources I have used in this book: the Qur'an, the Hadith, and the Sira. They have provided abundant evidence of this in recent years:\n\nOn March 28, 2003, the Palestinian Sheikh Muhammad Abu Al-Hunud warned in a sermon broadcast over Palestinian Authority television against those who would attempt to \""mess with Allah's book, to Americanize the region, Americanize the religion, Americanize the Koran, Americanize Muhammad's message....\"" Any doubt that he meant by this that the Qur'an and Muhammad's message would be stripped of their violent components were dispelled when he prayed about the Americans in Iraq: \""Allah, make their possessions a booty for the Muslims, Allah, annihilate them and their weapons, Allah, make their children orphans and their women widows....\""[23] On September 5, 2003, Sheikh Ibrahim Mudeiris invoked Muhammad's battles when speaking of the Iraq war in another sermon broadcast by the Palestinian Authority, though his memory of the Battle of Tabuk was a bit faulty: \""If we go back in the time tunnel 1400 years, we will find that history repeats itself.... Byzantium represents America in the west.... America will collapse, as Byzantium collapsed in the west....The Prophet [Muhammad] could, by means of unbroken ranks, conquer Byzantium, the greatest power compared to today's America -- and this without a single martyr falling from among the Muslims.... The Prophet could, by means of the unity of the Muslim ranks and its awakening, defeat the America of that time....America is our No. 1 enemy, and we see it as our No. 1 enemy as long as we learn from the lessons of the Battle of Tabouk [which took place in October 630 AD]: 'Make ready for them whatever you can of armed strength and of mounted pickets' [Koran 8:60]. We are prepared and ready, but victory is from Allah....\""[24] On November 21, 2003, Muslims poured out of the Maiduguri Road Central Mosque after Friday prayers in the Nigerian city of Kaduna, demanding the implementation of Sharia law and distributing flyers stating: \""The only solution is Jihad, the type of jihad put into practise by Prophet Muhammed and exemplified by Shehu Usman Dan Fodio and the late Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran. We Muslims should unite and embrace this concept of jihad that will undoubtedly empower us to destroy oppression and oppressors, and in its place establish Islam.\""[25] As late as November 2003, the website of the Islamic Affairs Department (IAD) of the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington, D.C. contained exhortations to Muslims to wage violent jihad in emulation of Muhammad: \""The Muslims are required to raise the banner of Jihad in order to make the Word of Allah supreme in this world, to remove all forms of injustice and oppression, and to defend the Muslims. If Muslims do not take up the sword, the evil tyrants of this earth will be able to continue oppressing the weak and [the] helpless....\"" It quotes Muhammad delivering Allah's words: \""Whoever of My slaves comes out to fight in My way seeking My pleasure, I guarantee him that I will compensate his suffering with reward and booty (during his lifetime) and if he dies, I would forgive him, have mercy on him and let him enter Paradise.\""[26] In December 2003, an Iraqi jihad warrior explained why he was fighting against the American troops there: \""The religious principle is that we cannot accept to live with infidels. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be on him, said, 'Hit the infidels wherever you find them.'\"" The man was, of course, quoting not a saying of Muhammad but Qur'an 9:5, the \""Verse of the Sword\"" - but it is easy to see why he would confuse the two.[27] ENTITY , the commander of the jihad group that killed twenty-two people in a jihad attack in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, on May 29, 2004, said that he acted in accord with Muhammad's wishes for Arabia: \""We are Mujahideen, and we want the Americans. We have not come to aim a weapon at the Muslims, but to purge the Arabian Peninsula, according to the will of our Prophet Muhammad, of the infidels and the polytheists who are killing our brothers in Afghanistan and Iraq....We began to comb the site looking for infidels. We found Filipino Christians. We cut their throats and dedicated them to our brothers the Mujahideen in the Philippines. [Likewise], we found Hindu engineers and we cut their throats too, Allah be praised. That same day, we purged Muhammad's land of many Christians and polytheists.\""[28] In the run-up to the 2004 American presidential election, a Muslim preacher invoked Muhammad to denounce democracy: \""Our Prophet did not run for office in any election....He did not win any political debate. [Instead] he won the war against the infidel.\""[29] A jihadist explaining that the Israeli/Palestinian struggle was more than just a nationalist conflict over land declared: \""But all of these people don't realize that our struggle with the Jews goes way back, ever since the first Islamic state was established in Madeenah with Muhammad (SAWS) the Messenger sent to all of mankind, as its leader. Allaah has related to us in the Qur'ân, the reality of the Jews' malice and hatred for the ummah of Islaam and Tawheed, as he says: 'You will surely find that the people with the most enmity towards the believers are the Jews and the polytheists.' (Surah Al-Maa'idah: 82) [Qur'an 5:82].[30] In October 2004, Sheikh Aamer Bin Abdallah Al-Aamer wrote this in the Al-Qaeda online journal Sawt al-Jihad: \""Perform the Jihad against your enemies with your [own two] hands, sacrifice your souls and your property in fighting your enemy, as an imitation of [the acts of] your Prophet [Muhammad] in the month of Ramadan [and in order to] enrage your enemies.\""[31] The influential American convert to Islam Hamza Yusuf in November 2004 invoked the Treaty of Hudaybiyya in exhorting Muslims to advance strategically toward their goals. \""There are times when you have to live like a sheep,\"" he explained, \""in order to live in the future like a lion.\""[32] In a January 2005 article in Arab News, columnist Adil Salahi reminded his readers that Muhammad never made war on a people without first inviting them to convert to Islam: \""During the Prophet's (peace be upon him) lifetime the Muslim community had to fight many battles, because there were several sources of danger and many opponents who were keen to suppress the rising voice of the Islamic message. The Prophet made sure that in none of these battles the Muslims would exceed the limits of what is lawful in Islam....[H]e would not launch an attack without alerting the enemy and calling on them to accept Islam and live in peace with the Muslim state.\""[33] (In May 2006, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran sent a letter to American President George W. Bush, a letter which he later explained was a call to Islam: \""The letter was an invitation to monotheism and justice, which are common to all divine prophets. If the call is responded positively,"

Al AQSA,1,"Gaza (QNN)- Israeli settlements near Gaza came under heavy rocket fire Tuesday morning after Israeli warplanes bombed a building in the Gaza Strip in a targeted strike, killing Palestinian Islamic Jihad Leader Bahaa Abu Ata and his wife and wounding others.

Al AQSA,0,"AMMAN: Few Jordanians had expected it to happen, so when the Royal Jordanian Army raised the national flag over the twin enclaves of Al-Baqoura and Al-Ghamr on Sunday, the mood across the country was a mix of delight and satisfaction.\n\nOn Monday, Jordanian TV showed King Abdullah II, in military uniform, touring Al-Baqoura, accompanied by Crown Prince Hussein and the army's chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Yousef Huneiti.\n\nThe events this week mark the end of a controversial 25-year-old lease agreement that came as a part of the 1994 Jordan-Israel peace treaty.\n\nIn 1950, Israel took the 6,000 dunams (1,482.63 acres) that make up Al-Baqoura, including an 820 dunam plot that the British Mandate government had given to Pinhas Rottenberg, a Zionist leader, in 1926 to build an electricity-generating company using the waters of the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers.\n\nDuring the 1967 war, Israel captured a further 4,000 dunams of land in Al-Ghamr, south of the Dead Sea. The plots in both Al-Baqoura and Al-Ghamr are rich in water supplies from natural aquifers located in Jordanian territory.\n\nJamal Jeet, an attorney and spokesman for the unified Jordanian Hirak (movement), knew more than a year ago that strong public support was needed if Amman intended to refuse to renew the lease agreement.\n\nAnnex 1b and 1c of the Jordan-Israel peace treaty allowed Israeli farmers to continue farming those tracts without paying any fees or taxes to Jordan. But Jeet was aware that the same section permitted the abrogation of the lease agreement, provided one side gave the other a year's notice.\n\n\I knew that the land was Jordanian and that we needed to cancel the 25-year-old lease,\"" Jeet said. As he told members of the Jordanian Bar Association: \""We need(ed) to do something unorthodox.\""\n\n\""I wanted advice from the association's head, Mazen Rosheidat, about an idea I had,\"" he told Arab News.\n\n\""We didn't want to issue a statement and make a symbolic act of protest. I wanted a legal notice to be issued and delivered at every courthouse in Jordan.\""\n\nRosheidat not only welcomed the idea but suggested that it be brought under the auspices of the bar association. Two committees were formed -- one to draft the text of the legal petition, and the other to help distribute it.\n\n\""Once the legal documents were ready, we made sure that a lawyer would take the lawsuit to the local courthouse and deposit it with the court clerk,\"" he said.\n\nThe document called on the government to issue a one-year notice -- before November 2018 -- for a formal end to the lease arrangement.\n\nJeet also made sure that activists throughout Jordan took part in a campaign in tandem with the legal process.\n\nA mural was placed at the Jordanian Professional Association's headquarters in Amman and hundreds of lawyers, doctors and engineers signed the document calling on the government of Omar Razzaz to issue the warning.\n\nThe campaign could not have occurred at more politically opportune moment. Ties between Jordan and Israel had cooled due to a number of decisions by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, including the withdrawal of support for a two-state solution, a refusal to stop Jewish hardliners from praying at the ENTITY Mosque compound, and the sidelining of Jordan as the administration of US President Donald Trump worked on a new Middle East peace plan.\n\nFASTFACTS\n\n* Al-Baqoura is 6,000 dunams of fertile, aquifer-rich land east of Jordan River.\n\n* Al-Ghamr is a 4 kilometer-wide, aquifer-rich area of land along Jordanian border, within Aqaba governorate.\n\n* Israel occupied Al-Baqoura in 1950 and 4,000 additional dunams of land in Al-Ghamr, south of the Dead Sea, in 1967.\n\n* Jordan and Israel signed Wadi Araba Peace Treaty in 1994.\n\n* Jordan announced in October 2018 it would not renew the 25-year lease.\n\n* The lease officially expired on Nov. 10, 2019.\n\nThe relationship had deteriorated so much that Abdullah had stopped taking phone calls from Netanyahu, after the Israeli leader was seen greeting an Israeli security guard who had shot two Jordanians and returned home after Amman, respecting his diplomatic immunity, handed him over. The guard did not face any legal action upon his return.\n\nFor Jeet, the very first sign that the association's campaign had been successful came when the king issued a short tweet on the issue on October 18 last year. \""Al-Baqoura and Al-Ghamr have been on the top of our priorities and our decision is to end the annexes in the peace treaty in light of what is good for Jordan and Jordanians,\"" it said.\n\nThat post kicked off a series of legal steps, culminating in the official decision to allow the Al-Baqoura and Al-Ghamr lease agreements to expire.\n\nThe Jordanian government's decision was not strongly contested by Israel, which had been preoccupied with two election campaigns and a corruption scandal embroiling Netanyahu.\n\nFor Kamel Abu Jaber, a former Jordanian foreign minister, the significance of the return of Al-Baqoura and Al-Ghamr cannot be overstated.\n\n\""This is very important not only to Jordan but to the Arab and Islamic worlds,\"" he told Arab News. \""It shows that the peace treaty, with all its problems, produced the return of the land.\n\n\""Jordan is able to put pressure on Israel as a result of Article 9 of the treaty with Israel.\""\n\nFor his part, Adnan Abu Odeh, who served as an advisor to both Abdullah and the late King Hussein, and as Jordan's permanent representative at the UN until 1992, says the return of two enclaves will encourage Jordanians.\n\n\""It is important because it encourages Jordanians to keep pushing for their rights and their interests, and (because) the government responded positively to public demands,\"" he told Arab News.\n\nAbu Odeh pointed out that in recent months Jordan had confronted Israel using legal means, such as its move to recall its ambassador, an action that prompted Israel to release two Jordanians.\n\n\""I hope that this will bring about further change in Israel's (behavior) in terms of what is happening in Jerusalem,\"" Abu Odeh said.\n\nJordanians who had gathered near Al-Ghamr on Monday were permitted by the Jordanian army to visit the reclaimed tracts of agricultural land. Al-Baqoura remains a closed military area.\n\nJeet told Arab News he was cautiously optimistic but keeping his emotions in check. \""We plan to hold a major rally to celebrate the return of Jordanian land,\"" he said, adding that he was disappointed a planned press conference by the foreign ministry at the Al-Ghamr site was moved to Amman.\n\nHe said what also worried him was a statement by a ministry source that Amman had assented to a one-time visit by Israeli farmers to harvest what was planted before the end of the lease.\n\nAyman Safadi, Jordan's foreign minister, said on Monday that Israel had given the names of four non-Israelis who would be harvesting the land.\n\nHe said the press conference was moved to Amman because the original site in Al-Ghamr lacked the requisite technical facilities.\n\nOfer Zalzberg, a senior analyst for the International Crisis Group, told Arab News that Jordan has come out a winner in the latest negotiations.\n\n\""Amman's decision to terminate the state-to-state arrangement and allow only a one-time, six-month extension should come as no surprise,\"" he told Arab News.\n\n\""Time will tell whether Israeli farmers who own land inside Jordan would be able to arrive at a new technical access arrangement to continue farming their lands while residing in Israel.\n\n\""Such a private arrangement may be possible only if it excludes the Israeli government and is devised exclusively within the bounds of Jordanian law.\"
Al AQSA,0,"After more than two years hoping for the resolution of his assault case, Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) investigator Novel Baswedan faces another hurdle. He has been accused of faking the acid attack against him.\n\nBig data analysts have traced the allegations, which have been making rounds on social media, to posts by buzzers earlier this month saying that Novel had fabricated his case.\n\nIndonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) politician Dewi Ambarwati, however, decided on Wednesday to take the rumors to the next level. She reported Novel to the Jakarta Police, accusing him of faking the attack.\n\n\There are several oddities in the things that occurred, starting from the CCTV recording, the shape of the wound, the bandage and the head. But he ended up being blind,\"" Dewi said.\n\n\""Someone covered in hot water [acid] wouldn't stand still but would be falling and rolling around instead. That's what I have learned,\"" she added.\n\nDewi demanded Indonesian doctors disclose Novel's medical records as she refused to believe the version written by the Singaporean hospital where Novel underwent treatment.\n\nBefore filing the report against Novel, Dewi had reportedly gone to the police with allegations of treason against critics of President Joko \""Jokowi\"" Widodo, including National Mandate Party (PAN) patron Amien Rais, firebrand cleric Rizieq Shihab and lawyer Eggi Sudjana, kompas.com reported.\n\nAnalysts at big data consulting company Drone Emprit said social media buzzers began to spread \""disinformation\"" that Novel had faked his attack around Nov. 1, just as Jokowi renewed his call for the National Police to conclude the acid-attack investigation by next month.\n\nSome of the most prolific Twitter accusers included @AdellaWibawa and @Triwulan82 -- both of whom, according to Drone Emprit, were well-known Jokowi supporters during the 2019 presidential election.\n\nDrone Emprit analysts, however, declined to consider the buzzers either pro-Jokowi or pro-government, noting that there could be various motives prompting the users to share the disinformation.\n\nNovel said during an interview with Kompas TV on Thursday that it was not important for him to respond. He believed the PDI-P politician herself knew she had filed a \""haphazard\"" report to the police.\n\nNovel's team of lawyers demanded the police discontinue the report, which they called \""slanderous\"", as the acid attack was a proven legal fact.\n\n\""The report is an attempt to criminalize the victim. It is strongly believed that [the report] is meant to undermine support for the case's resolution and for corruption eradication efforts in Indonesia as a whole,\"" Jakarta Legal Aid Institute (LBH) director Alghiffari ENTITY, one of Novel's lawyers, said in a written statement on Thursday.\n\nHe criticized the report's timing, asking why it was filed during a moment of public pressure on the president to issue a government regulation in lieu of law (Perppu) on the KPK. He said the state had to resolve the case after more than two years of fruitless probing.\n\n\""This is beyond human reason and limits. We will take legal action for defamation against Novel,\"" he added.\n\nThe lawyers also demanded Jokowi establish an independent team directly accountable to the president.\n\nThe Indonesia Corruption Watch (ICW) coordinator Adnan Topan Husodo expressed a similar opinion, saying the reporting was a counterattack not only against Novel but also against the antigraft body.\n\n\""Why have false accusations repeatedly been generated while corruption eradication efforts are attenuated?\"" he asked on Thursday.\n\n\""This is a big lesson for us. It is better to reform our country's political institutions rather than simply encourage good people to enter the system,\"" he said.\n\nNew National Police chief Gen. Idham Azis, the former detective chief who previously led the police's technical team for the probe, has said that he will assign a new chief detective to solve the case."

Al AQSA,0,"Articles and letters may be edited for the purposes of clarity and space. They are published in good faith with a view to enlightening all the stakeholders. However, the contents of these writings may not necessarily match the views of the newspaper.\n\nTorture in custody\n\nPakistan is a country where cases of custodial death are increasing day by day. The primary duty of police is to protect the citizens and their rights but sadly here in Pakistan instead of protecting the citizens and their rights is responsible for killing the one's being accused. They misuse the word \Custodians of law\"" and take the law in their hands. Instead of investigating and trying to find the truth they start torturing the accused in order to make them accept the crimes they didn't even commit and even if they committed those crimes police is no one to punish them.\n\nIt's only the judiciary that can punish them and that too in accordance with the law. Recently a man named Salahuddin, a suspected robber who was seen robbing an ATM and sticking his tongue out and making faces in the CCTV cameras was arrested by the police and a video of him being tortured during investigation was released and then the next day his death was confirmed. His father stated that his son was mentally disabled that's why he had tattooed his name and address on his arm for identification purposes. He was tortured by the custodians of law; there were torture marks and bruises on his body. \""But the question is why was he tortured? For committing a crime about which he himself wasn't aware? A person who didn't even have the sense of vice and virtue was pushed to death by the custodians of law.\n\nRIDA HAMNA\n\nIslamabad\n\nInter family marriage\n\nThe practice of marriage between first cousins is traditionally common in Pakistan. This practice doubles risk of children being born with birth defects, according to the research rate of death and congenital abnormalities in the babies are higher than expected. Marriage to a blood relative accounted for nearly a (31%) of all birth defects in babies of Pakistani origin.\n\nThe risk of having a baby with birth defects and abnormalities are usually heart or nervous system problems which can sometimes be fatal and it rises from 3% in the general Pakistani population to 6 % and spina bifida or cystic fibrosis is three per cent to four perccent among those married to blood relatives. Every year there are about 90 more baby deaths than would be expected in the Pakistani community because of birth defects. The issue is highly sensitive because marriage within families is an established tradition. Health professionals should come forward and help create awareness among the general masses about the issue.\n\nROHMA ALI\n\nIslamabad\n\nTechnology and risk in supply chain\n\nTechnology and supply chain are interlinked. There are always risks involved in technology like cyber security, risks associated with robots and artificial intelligence steep pressure to innovate workforce shortages and lack in diversity. All of these technological risks are connected with supply chain.\n\nIn today's era of digitalization, the role of Technology has made supply chain management towards a new direction with an increasing emphasis on technological progression.To build a substantial customer base digitalization for all the business processes has become essential.\n\nFirstly, Contractual risk involves adequacy of selection of digital enabler. It involves prioritization of initiatives ensuring minimum impact or disruption of services. Secondly, Implementation risk involves architecture for the digital enablers. It involves a culture of digital mindset and secure usage of the digital components. And finally, governance risk revolves around the digital transformation to ensure cross functional synergies and eliminate risk arising due to interdependent processes. There are several other scenarios across digital industries regarding risk domains that would be considered. In a survey of over 500 business continuity professionals from 71 countries, 75% of respondents reported that they did not have full visibility of their supply chain and then 30% did not know where they fit into any of their supplier's priorities. A solution to reduce risk by tracking locations, monitoring environmental conditions, alerting of real-time exceptions, verification of drivers and smart sensors placed on packages transmitted data at customised business defined interval. This information flow will provide the necessary visibility to reduce risk technology and supply chain can help each other grow only if used in the right way by the right people and at the right time.\n\nENTITY Kanwal Khan\n\nIslamabad\n\nSukkur to Multan motorway\n\nThe Sukkur-Multan Motorway MF has been completed for about 4 months, but for unknown reasons it is not being opened for traffic and the Rohri police have made this situation a source of earning. Ding Zhou, chief construction expert of a Chinese company working on the federal government's project under CPEC, announced in June this year that the company had completed the project.\n\nA July date for opening was given but for unknown reasons the project could not be opened.

It was opened but closed two days later for some unknown reasons. Thereafter, another date was given on November 7 to open the B motorway M5. In this, most of the citizens travelling for long trip from Karachi have complained that the policemen riding a police mobile on the Rohri interchange of the motorway M5 charge Rs 500. Taking the presents, they allow them to get on the motorway, but they prevent such vehicles from travelling further to the next interchange. The SSP Sukkur Irfan Sims was unaware of any such police corruption when contacted.\n\nThe 392-km-long motorway M5, which cuts the distance from Sukkur to Multan National Highway, cost around Rs 2.89 billion.

Al AQSA,1,"A view of Amman, Jordan from the Citadel atop Jabal al-Qal'a. (photo credit: Wikimedia Commons)\n\nJordan will not celebrate the 25th anniversary of the festive signing of the historic peace agreement with Israel in Wadi Araba this month. The winds of reconciliation that blew at the time - the dreams - have long since dissipated. Most people in Amman do not feel there is anything to celebrate, and those who do believe in the agreement and in the vitality of the Kingdom prefer to downplay their emotions.\n\nDespite the grimness - and regardless of the crisis between the two states over the Jordanian enclaves of Tzofar and Naharayim, leased to Israel and soon to be returned to Jordanian sovereignty - the peace agreement is alive, albeit light years away from the dreams of former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and King Hussein, may they rest in peace.\n\nAhead of the anniversary, a Mitvim Institute team visited Amman and held policy dialogues with academics, diplomats and former army officers. Many expressed amazement that we had bothered to come - that someone in Israel is interested in Jordan and wants to know how to improve the relationship, how unnecessary crises can be averted, and how the sides can work together toward a common goal of peace and prosperity.\n\nIsraeli officials, researchers or politicians hardly ever come here anymore, our interlocutors told us. The one exception are the Israeli security officials who regularly and frequently meet with their Jordanian counterparts. The security aspects of the peace accord run smoothly, reflecting the security-oriented approach of the outgoing government - an approach that prioritizes security relations over all other aspects, believing that no progress on them is possible.\n\nWhile security issues are important, should the strategic ties with the Hashemite Kingdom be limited only to them? Can a limited relationship that begins and ends with ties between defense officials carry the weight of the entire agreement for long? Do economic, diplomatic and civilian ties not create an additional layer to the relationship that can also enhance progress in the security field?\n\nThe peace agreement with Egypt has also been emptied of real content, being largely limited to security cooperation - with normalization nowhere on the horizon. Many in Israel believe that, given the opposition to normalization by many Jordanians and Egyptians, there is no choice but to make do with what is available - security cooperation that does, indeed, save lives and provides security and defense.\n\nDuring the journey to Amman, we came to realize the extent to which Jordan desires cooperation with Israel in areas such as tourism (including medical tourism), water and hi-tech. Israel does not prioritize these fields, and they are not at the top of the government's diplomatic agenda (if it even has one). Thus, after many years of discussing major and significant mutual projects, these are postponed endlessly to the chagrin of the potential Jordanian partners.\n\nJORDAN'S ECONOMIC crisis and its hosting of 1.5 million Syrian refugees came up in every conversation we had in Amman. The crisis is not new, and last year the Jordanian capital was shaken by mass protests against government, cutbacks and corruption - similar to the ones taking place in Beirut these days. Arab states, the US and the World Bank have provided urgent aid to stabilize the Kingdom, but Israel hardly noticed.\n\nThe media does not deal with the major projects, which have been stuck for years, or with the fact that Israel could have done a lot more to help its neighbor to the East attain economic stability - which could have definitely enhanced security, too. Israelis are not sufficiently interested in Jordan, even though the country is of vital importance to Israel's security - with its 309-km. (192-mile) border a vital shield against any troubles from the East.\n\nThe Israeli enthusiasm over the signing of the 1994 peace agreement has already waned, and Israelis only touch down with Jordan when they fly to the Far East and transit through Amman, or when vacationing in Aqaba. By the way, anyone wishing to shorten the waiting time at the land border between the two states will have to shell out hundreds of dollars for the very short flight. There is barely any demand for that route, and the Jordanians would rather sell Israelis cheap tickets for continuing flights to India, Thailand and Sri Lanka, aviation sources told us.\n\nThe absence of visits also stems from the difficulties most Jordanians have to get entry visas to Israel. Jordanian-Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab told us about repeated requests by his friends and family to visit Israel for family occasions or other needs. \In the end, people simply give up. Israel loses out big time because those who do manage to get a visa are generally favorably impressed and take home a positive impression of the state,\"" Kuttab said.\n\nThe Mitvim Institute's 2018 Foreign Policy Index attests to the same attitudes. Most Israelis view Saudi Arabia as the most important Arab state, not Jordan or Egypt - Israel's strategic peace partners and its immediate neighbors. Of the two, Egypt is regarded as far more important than Jordan.\n\nThe public is influenced greatly by the policy of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who talks with certainty about the strengthening ties with Arab states and the new horizons for Israel's relationship with Gulf capitals. He never mentions the decline in trade between Israel and Jordan, the endless foot dragging over the Med-Dead project that generates great anger in Jordan, and the fact that nothing is left of the regional prosperity and cooperation forged in 1994.\n\nTHE PALESTINIAN issue is central to Israeli-Jordanian relations. The percentage of Palestinians in the Hashemite Kingdom is a matter of contention - the Jordanians say they constitute 40% of the population whereas Israel is convinced the number is 60%. Either way, the situation in the West Bank, and especially in Jerusalem, has a significant impact on Jordanian attitudes toward Israel. For Netanyahu, the Palestinians are no longer relevant, and Arab states have abandoned their cause.\n\nHowever, our conversations in Amman made clear that this approach is illogical and not feasible. Jordan greatly fears escalation in the West Bank, especially in Jerusalem's ENTITY Mosque, and seeks better lines of communication with Israel.\n\nWith a relatively modest investment and prioritization of the relationship with the Kingdom, Israel could save itself the repeated embarrassments it has recently experienced in relations with Jordan. Jordanian scholars and journalists told us that had Israel acted in a diplomatic and rational fashion, it could have boosted the King's standing vis-à-vis radicals and BDS proponents. They were puzzled over Israel's preference for humiliating and undermining its strategic partner and the stability of that regime. Why did Netanyahu embrace the security guard who had shot dead a Jordanian at the embassy in Amman? Why was there no serious, in-depth investigation of the death of a Jordanian judge at the Allenby Bridge border crossing? Why is Israel playing along with Saudi aspirations on ENTITY?\n\nOur Jordanian interlocutors wondered what Israel's policy on Jordan was and had a hard time understanding why Israel was shaking off the important alliance with all its might. In this context, the recent call by Blue and White Party chairman Benny Gantz at a rally on the Naharayim Peace Island, to strengthen the peace with Jordan and create a \""region of cooperation\"" along the border, is of particular importance.\n\nWhen the argument is heard that Israel's standing in the Middle East has never been better, it is worth noticing developments in Jordan. The peace agreement with Jordan, just like the Jordan River, tends to dry up over time unless efforts are made to nurture it. Despite the frustration and disappointment, we returned from Amman with a clear sense that repairing or restarting the relationship is within the realm of the possible. Israel could win back Jordan with the right media coverage and attention, by revving up significant economic projects that would help resolve Jordan's water shortage and create jobs, with an effort to break though the deadlock in the Palestinian arena.\n\nIn the final analysis, Jordan is right here: within touching distance and not in the dark beyond. Anyone who restores Jordan to the top of Israel's list of diplomatic priorities would do wonders for the relationship between us, benefiting all sides.\n\nThe writer is a Policy Fellow at Mitvim - The Israeli Institute for Regional Foreign Policies, and a former Member of Knesset.\n\nvar cont = 'Join Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

Al AQSA,0,"After nine months in detention and two failed deportation attempts, Israel releases East Jerusalem resident Mustafa al-Haruf. He has been living in Jerusalem for over 20 years, yet Israel refuses to grant him permanent status.\n\nJournalist Mustafa al-Haruf, a Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem, was released from Givon Prison on Thursday afternoon after nine months in detention. Waiting to greet him were his wife, young daughter, relatives, friends, and his lawyer.\n\n\It's good to be out,\"" said al-Haruf as he embraced his 2-year-old daughter. While he was in prison, he had only been able to see her through glass during visiting hours.\n\nAl-Haruf's wife, Tamam, who had been waiting outside for several hours, said: \""We are happy that his imprisonment is finally over and Mustafa is free to return to his family. This whole period has been very difficult. We all suffered from his imprisonment, particularly his daughter. He cannot leave Jerusalem; it is the center of his life. How can he go to a foreign country? He has no other place to live.\""\n\nAl-Haruf was arrested in January from his East Jerusalem home and charged with illegal residency, even though he has lived in Jerusalem since the age of 12. He is married to an East Jerusalem resident, and his father was born in the city. During his imprisonment, the government tried unsuccessfully to have him deported to Jordan.\n\nLast month, the custody review board at Givon Prison decided that al-Haruf would be released if the Interior Ministry failed to have him deported by Oct. 24.

The detention of the prisoner is not based on his behavior or on his conduct.\"" The judge added that the delay in releasing al-Haruf had been caused by Jordan's refusal to take him in.\n\nIn his decision, the judge ordered al-Haruf to establish his legal status in East Jerusalem within 21 days, or leave the country. The ruling ignores the fact that al-Haruf cannot leave Israel, because he does not have legal status or residency in any other country.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, a few hours before his scheduled release from prison, the Interior Ministry submitted a request to delay it for another week, claiming that it was close to an agreement with Jordan for his deportation. According to the request submitted to the judge: \""The Ministry of Interior is working continuously in cooperation with the relevant Jordanian authorities, and is waiting for their response.\"" Nevertheless, Judge Mazouk ruled on Thursday morning to uphold al-Haruf's release.\n\n\""This is a happy day. We are seeing him leave the prison in which he should not have spent a single day,\"" said his lawyer Adi Lustigman. She continued: \""There is a long battle ahead of us regarding his status. As the son of two parents who were permanent residents of Jerusalem, he should have been given an identity card when he was a child. We will not back down until he receives his residency permit and can live with his family in the only place he knows as home.\""\n\nOver the last few months, the Interior Ministry tried twice to deport him to Jordan. In July 2019, he waited for hours at the border crossing between the two countries, but the Jordanians refused to allow him in. Informed sources acknowledged last month that Jordan would never agree to accept al-Haruf.\n\nDuring the deportation hearings, the Interior Ministry presented classified evidence from the Shin Bet, according to which al-Haruf was ostensibly connected with or active in terror organizations. He has never, however, been charged with or tried for any such connection. Because the information is classified, al-Haruf and his lawyer could not contest the charges.\n\nThroughout the period of his imprisonment, al-Haruf insisted that he had not committed any crime, and that the associations he has been accused of resulted from his work as a journalist. As a reporter, he has on several occasions covered demonstrations at ENTITY Mosque. \""We were given a list of people with whom it is permitted and forbidden to speak,\"" he said during one of the deportation hearings. Israeli journalists may speak with any source, including enemy sources; but when a Palestinian journalist speaks with the same sources, or receives information about political demonstrations, the state regards this as \""contact with members of an unauthorized organization."
Al AQSA,1,"Amjad Jabarin was convicted of providing material aid to three terrorists who shot two police officers to death near the Temple Mount in 2017.\n\nBy Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News\n\nHaifa's District Court sentenced Amjad Jabarin on Wednesday to 16 years in prison and levied a half-million shekel fine for his major role in helping three terrorists kill two police officers near the Temple Mount two years ago.\n\nThe Arab-Israeli from Umm al-Fahm was convicted of aiding and abetting murder, operating a weapon for terror purposes, conspiracy to commit a crime and obstruction of justice.\n\nThe three-judge panel unanimously agreed with the prosecution that Jabarin had helped plan the attack and hide two Carlo-style submachine guns and a pistol in the Mount's ENTITY Mosque on the morning of July 14, 2017.\n\nA relative of one of the men and a friend of the two others, who all came from his hometown, Jabarin also drove them to the bus that took them to the Old City that early Friday morning.\n\nAfter retrieving their guns from the mosque, the three Israeli Arabs opened fire at a group of Israeli Border Police standing near the Lion's Gate of the Old City.\n\nDruze officers Haiel Sitawe, 30, a five-year veteran, and Kamil Shnaan, a 22-year-old who had joined the force out of high school, died of their wounds within hours of the shooting. Another officer was lightly injured by shrapnel in the neck, arms and hands.\n\nSitawe left behind a wife and three-week old son. Shnaan, who was the son of former Labor Party MK Shachiv Shnaan, had been planning to get engaged later that week.\n\nAfter the sentencing, Shachiv Shnaan was angry that Jabarin was not given life in prison for his actions. He was, however, ordered to pay each of his dead victims' families NIS 278,000 in compensation in addition to the jail time.\n\nImmediately after the attack, the terrorists fled toward one of the mosques in the Temple Mount complex and were killed in a shootout with police.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, the government decided to install metal detectors and security cameras at the entrances to the Temple Mount, which it then took down after several days of Arab protests, violent clashes with police, and a diplomatic incident with Jordan.\n\nAmjad JabarinHaiel SitaweKamil ShnaanTemple MountTerror Attack"
Al AQSA,0,"3:36 PM | October 21, 2019 Scores of Jewish settlers storm ENTITY amid tension\n\nIt has been seventy-two years now that Pakistan came into being. Where does the country today stands viz a viz the countries liberated during the same period and what social, economic and scientific achievements they have made are hidden to none. Whereas Pakistan is at many cross roads and its economic condition is fast deteriorating with each passing day. It has peculiar economic problems with a very large population, mostly unemployed with no future as the country could not sustain economic growth both due to internal as well as external factors. The major issues that ail the economy today are absence of \good economic governance\"", \""rule of law\"" and \""accountability\"". One of the cabinet ministers has recently announced that the youth should not look up to the government for the jobs which are to be offered by the private sector and is itself in doldrums.\n\nThe World Bank while cautioning the economy has linked it with medium-term outlook subject to the country's ability to ensure political stability and a return to normalcy. Growth for 2019, according to the Bank, is expected at 2.7 percent, as many important economic sectors show relatively weak performance. The slowdown in economic activities is expected to constrain jobs and wage growth in the near-term. The decrease in remittances will also lead to lower contributions to household income. As a result, the pace of poverty reduction is expected to slow down, with poverty measured using the USD 5.50 poverty line projected at 36.1 percent in 2019. On the domestic front, a challenging political environment, delays or reversals in efforts to strengthen revenues, and a slower than expected recovery of some key economic sectors represent important risks. Mitigating these risks will be key to creating private sector jobs and accelerating poverty reduction.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also forecasted a very bleak economic indicators for Pakistan for fiscal year 2020. The unemployment rate in Pakistan is expected to rise from 6.1 percent to 6.2 percent in 2020, whereas the gross domestic product (GDP) growth is forecasted to continue shrinking to 2.4 percent. On the other hand, the IMF forecasted the inflation rate in Pakistan to surge as high as 13 percent in 2020. In 2024, it may fall to 5 percent on the basis of consumer price index (CPI).\n\nYet the prime minister tweets on 17 October, 2019 just after the publication of the WB and IMF reports that \""it is a great achievement of our economic team to turn around the economy within a year\"". Does the prime minister really understand what the IMF and World Bank reports really mean and say and their implications on a common man, now seems to be a big question mark? No doubt that the international organizations are endeavoring for economic amelioration of a large section of mankind, however, merely statistical impressive increase in GDP etc. is not a matter of content. On the whole it is no more than a mere pittance for the poor.\n\nThe factors underlying the creation of the country were both economic and religious. The Muslims of Indo-Pakistan were anxious to prevent the economic dominations by Hindus as they feared being reduced to a position of drawers of water and hewers of wood. The Objective Resolution, which at first was the preamble and now a part of the constitution places a constitutional obligation to enable the Muslims of Pakistan to order their life in accordance with injunctions of the Quran and Sunnah, which ensures the wellbeing and economic uplift of its people. For some of the fundamental human rights we have to refer to the last Sermon (Khutbah) of the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.) delivered on the occasion of his farewell pilgrimage to Makkah. It contains unique principles of equality of human beings and rules of economic and political importance. Islam was instrumental in establishing an egalitarian order based on justice, goodness, righteousness and human dignity for the triumph of virtue and truth leading to man's salvation and the birth of a great civilization.\n\nA question may be raised, why is it important to talk about Islamic democracy when we have been practicing western type of democracy in the country now for some decades, when the masses, owing in particular to low rate of literacy do not understand the real implications of parliamentary democracy, how it has to be worked, the demand it makes from the voters and the elected representatives of various political parties. Parliamentary democracy of purely western type has, however, not flourished in Pakistan, it has not yet taken roots in its original form and maturity. No serious attempts were made to adopt it to the conditions prevalent in the country and the genesis of the nation. What has the western parliamentary democracy, in which the parliament is the supreme institution for ensuring the implementation of the constitution in letter and spirit given to this nation? The parliament is even unable to conduct the business smoothly and legislate for the betterment of the country. However, when the need arises, unknown impetus makes the fragile political system work and decisively vote in chairman senate's election and passing of the Anti-money Laundering 2010 (Amendment) Bill 2019.\n\nNot only have individuals, with the exception of a few misused power for their personal ends, but political parties and groups have exercised, in this country during the last few decades, social, economic and political power in complete disregard of all norms of equity, and in violation of rules with impunity with the result that larger sections of the people have suffered and remained materially and otherwise more or less at the stage where they were at the beginning of the history of this country.\n\nMany political experiments have been made in the country including martial laws, unfortunately none of them could give the country a clean, ethical and morally sound and responsible society with sustained economic growth. Time has come to implement Islamic democracy in the country which is an important feature of Islamic ideology, and provides a practical way of life and affords solutions for many ills of the present-day society. If we come back to the Quran, we will find it offers the best social, economic, accountability and political order for the modern times as well. Our society needs to be reconstituted on the basis of Islam and the country needs to be governed with Islamic democracy."

ANIS Ibrahim,1,"London, Nov 4 (PTI) Jabir Moti, referred to as a \top lieutenant\"" of Dawood ENTITY's D Company, used Jeffrey Epstein's suicide to decry prison conditions in the US as he appeared before a UK court on Monday in his ongoing fight against his extradition.\n\nMoti is fighting his extradition to the US at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London on charges of laundering around USD 1.4 million on behalf of the criminal network.\n\nMoti's barrister, Edward Fitzgerald, deposed two retired prison wardens via videolink from the US to establish that his client would be at risk of committing suicide if he was to be extradited to a New York prison.\n\nOne of the prison facilities in question, the Metropolitan Correctional Centre (MCC), is where American financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in August.\n\nEpstein's suicide hit worldwide headlines due to his high-profile connections, including alleged links with Britain's Prince Andrew - the younger son of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\""I don't believe his mental health needs will be met [in prison], especially since the Epstein suicide,\"" said Maureen Baird, a former Warden at MCC.\n\nThe hearing, presided over by Judge John Zani at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London, also heard evidence from a former Warden at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in nearby Brooklyn, where Moti is expected to be held in pre-trial detention if he were to be extradited.\n\nThe hearing on Monday concluded the evidence stage of the extradition trial, with closing submissions to be made before Judge Zani in November 27 -- the date when he will set a timeframe to deliver his verdict.\n\nAt previous hearings in the case in July, the UK court has heard that Dawood ENTITY is a fugitive from Indian justice and currently in exile in Pakistan.\n\nWestminster Magistrates' Court was told that Dawood is wanted for coordinated bombings in Mumbai in 1993 that killed more than 200 people and because Moti is linked to the \""designated terrorist\"" he would be at risk of being held in extreme pre-trial detention conditions were he to be extradited to the US.\n\n\""The head of D Company is Dawood ENTITY, an Indian Muslim currently in exile in Pakistan. Dawood ENTITY and his brother and top lieutenant, ENTITY, have been fugitives from India since 1993, when D Company was implicated in coordinated bombings in Mumbai that killed more than 200 people,\"" according to excerpts of a US Attorney's affidavit for extradition read out by Moti's barrister previously.\n\n\""The present investigation has revealed that Jabir Motiwala is a top lieutenant in D Company who reports directly to Dawood ENTITY,\"" he added.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), on behalf of the US government, has tried to establish the US Attorney's \""express declaration\"" that Moti will be detained under humane conditions.\n\nCPS barrister John Hardy has previously said that even though Dawood ENTITY is a \""designated terrorist\"" by the FBI, D Company - an international criminal network based in Pakistan, India and the UAE - is not a designated orgENTITYation.\n\n\""Mr Moti is not being pursued at trial as a terrorist,\"" Hardy noted.\n\nMoti aka Motiwala aka.

ANSAR AL-ISLAM,1,"Those spread rumours through social media identified, says home minister Asaduzzaman\n\nThe government is soon going to ban the 'Allahar Dal' outfit as part of its move to curb militancy in the country, Home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal said yesterday. \Members of Allahar Dal were conducting their activities by distributing leaflets. That's why we are going to black-list it,\"" the minister told reporters. He was speaking at a meeting with Bangladesh Secretariat Reporter's Forum (BSRF) in the Secretariat. \""Our government has zero tolerance against terrorism and militancy,\"" the minister added. According to intelligence agencies, the 'Allahar Dal' outfit is trying to regroup in the country and amassing money in various bank accounts maintained under fake names to carry out subversive activities. The Islamist outfit is spreading propaganda and false interpretations of Islam to lure the general public under its banner, said sources with Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and police. RAB arrested 8 members of the outfit from Dakkhin Khan and Hatirjheel areas of the capital, including the outfit's acting Ameer Ibrahim Ahmed Hero in drives conducted in August. The arrestees provided information about plans to carryout subversive activities, said RAB.\n\nAccording to sources, the outfit 'Allahar Dal' was formed under the leadership of militant Matin Mehedi alias Mominul Islam alias Matin Mahbub alias Mehedi Hasan in 1995. Matin had also worked as chief security officer at the National Parliament House, said RAB.\n\nThe outfit joined with another notorious outfit Jamaat'ul Mujaheedin Bangladesh (JMB) in 2004. After the government crackdown on JMB following series bomb blasts across the country in 2005, the outfit left its JMB affiliation and tried to regroup independently.\n\n'Allahar Dal' chief Matin Mehedi was arrested in 2005 by RAB and he is currently in Tangail jail serving a life imprisonment sentence. But his supporters are covertly running activities of the outfit and trying to gain strength, said sources.\n\nThe organization has a detailed structure reaching up to the village level with chiefs of divisions holding the title of Nayak while various central leaders hold the titles of Odhinayok (commander), Upa-Odhinayok\n\n(deputy commander) and Tara Taroka (star actor) at the highest level, said RAB. The outfit attempts to recruit retired and discharged members of various forces as they already have arms training. They made a priority to recruit discharged BGB members, said sources.\n\n'Allahar Dal' member told law enforcers that they believe their chief Matin Mehedi could be a special messenger from Allah. The outfit does not believe in the constitution of Bangladesh or democracy, said intelligence sources.\n\nEarlier, the government had banned seven Islamic groups for \""being threat to public order\"" by carrying out militant activities in the name of establishing the rule of Allah.\n\nThe banned groups are ENTITY, Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh (JMJB), Harkat-ul-Jehad al-Islami Bangladesh (HUJI-B), Hizb ut-Tahrir and Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT).\n\nOn March 5, 2017, the home ministry's Public Security Division had banned ENTITY by issuing a notification.\n\n\""The activities of ENTITY threatens peace and stability in Bangladesh. All activities of this group are banned because they constitute a threat to public order,\"" the notification said.\n\nJMB and three other organisations were banned in 2005. Top JMB leader Shaykh Abdur Rahman Siddikul Islam alias Bangla Bhai was hanged for killing judges at the time.\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir was banned in 2009 for preaching extremist views.\n\nWith the law enforcers cracking down hard on militancy, no significant activities of the radical organisations were seen until the murder of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider in 2013.\n\nThe blogger's murder had exposed Ansarullah's existence and the outfit's chief, Mufti Jasimuddin Rahmani, was jailed for the crime. Besides, two of his followers were sentenced to death, one to life in prison, and four others to different terms for killing the blogger.\n\nPolice said that after ABT was banned in May 2015, its members regrouped under the banner of ENTITY.\n\nThey suspect that sacked Army major Ziaul Haque, who masterminded a failed coup to topple the Sheikh Hasina government in January 2012, is involved with ENTITY.\n\nThe outfit reportedly claims to be the Bangladesh offshoot of Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS).\n\nAccording to the law enforcement and intelligence agencies, there are at least 12 militant outfits operating in the country. These are Islam o Muslim, Allahar Dal, Islamic Democratic Party, Towhidi Trust, Amiuddin Bangladesh, Ulama Anjuman Al Bayenaat, Bishwa Islamic Front, Harkat-e-Islam Al Jihad, Muslim Millat Sharifa Council, Dawate Islam, Joishey Mostafa of Bangladesh and Hizbullah Islami Somaj."

ANSAR AL-ISLAM,1,"Counterterrorism officials yesterday claimed to have arrested two \Neo JMB\"" operatives for their alleged involvement in recent attacks on police in Gulistan and Science Lab areas in Dhaka.\n\nMehedi Hasan Tamim, 25, and his friend Abdullah Azmir, 26, were arrested in Mohammadpur area on Sunday night. They were members of this \""Neo JMB\"" group's military wing, said police.\n\nTamim was present at the time of both attacks while Azmir was planning and making improvised explosive devices or IEDs, said Monirul Islam, chief of Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) Unit of Dhaka Metropolitan Police.\n\n\""They targeted police to draw the attention of global terror outfit Islamic State and set up communication,\"" he told the press at DMP Media Centre yesterday.\n\nOn April 29, two traffic police constables and a community traffic policeman were injured in an IED blast in Gulistan while two policemen were injured in a similar attack at Science Lab intersection on August 31.\n\nBesides, on May 26, two people, including a female police officer, suffered injuries when a bomb went off near a police pickup in Malibagh intersection area. On July 24, IEDs were recovered from near police boxes in Paltan and Khamarbari areas.\n\nPolice suspected that the arrestees were also connected to these three incidents.\n\nMonirul Islam said this group planned a similar attack on police in September but police foiled it by raiding a Narayanganj den and arresting two members on September 23.\n\nThe arrestees were Farid Uddin Rumee, 27, a teacher of mechanical and production engineering at Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology in Dhaka, and Mishuk Khan Mizan, 24, a final-year engineering student of Narayanganj Polytechnic Institute.\n\nRumee's younger brother Rafiq, 25, who formed the five-member military wing of the group, is on the run.\n\nCTTC officials said Azmir was among the four youths seen in the so-called IS footage circulated recently.

They were radicalised online during university study.\n\nInitially, they used to write for the blogs of banned outfit ENTITY. But soon they assumed IS ideology, believing it to be better and more effective.\n\nInstead of blog writing they decided to carry out attacks and left homes in 2018.

ANSAR AL-ISLAM,1,"On Sunday, a Bangladeshi court indicted eight men, all part of a radical Islamic terrorist organization, for the murder of Faisal Abedin Deepan (below, also spelling \Dipon\"" or \""Dipan\"" in some accounts).\n\nDeepan, the former head of the Jagriti Prakashani publishing house, had put out the works of Dr. Avijit Roy, an atheist author who was hacked to death in February of 2015. (Earlier this year, six men were charged with his assassination.) The 43-year-old publisher was found dead in his office by his own father, who told reporters \""I saw him lying upside down and in a massive pool of blood. They slaughtered his neck. He is dead.\""\n\nThe attack on Deepan's life occurred in October of 2015 by members of the group ENTITY. Another publisher of Roy's books was also attacked that day, but he thankfully survived. It's suspected that the same group went after both publishers.\n\nAnti-Terrorism Special Tribunal Judge Majibur Rahman read out the charges to six of the suspects, who pleaded not guilty. Another two, including a sacked military official, remained fugitives, but the judge issued arrest warrants for them.\n\nAs we've said before, it's appalling that it took this long for police to get to the bottom of this murder, and equally upsetting that it may have been the incredible amount of global outrage that spurred them to even give a damn.\n\nStill, after a wave of attacks on atheists and their allies in Bangladesh, it appears that their assailants are finally being held to account.\n\nBlasphemy, as they say, is a victimless crime. But in Bangladesh, those accused of blaspheming have been victims of unspeakable horrors. The government often made the problem worse by suggesting that criticizing religion was an actual problem. It's about time the police treated the attackers the way they used to treat their victims."
Balochistan Liberation Army,1,"INTERNAL security is an essential element of national security. The Quaid said, a government is responsible for maintaining order and protecting life and property, and religious belief. Provincialism, sectarianism and ethnic divisions have led to different phases of violence but a well-articulated internal security policy couldn't be formulated.\n\nTribalism, feudalism, weak governance, corruption and poor socioeconomic conditions are threat enablers; sectarianism, sub-nationalism and extremism are threat multipliers. While globalisation encourages innovation and information-sharing, it has also led to the misuse of technology. Violent non-state actors on the internet pose serious security challenges ie encrypted communication, online access to IED- and suicide vest-making techniques.\n\nPakistan's internal security mosaic needs integrated reforms. Out of the 26 constitutional amendments, four directly pertain to internal security. Without incorporating key players, national security issues cannot be effectively addressed. Implementing Article 140-A will boost local governments, which will help in executing internal security policies. Besides the Anti-Terrorism Act, Anti-Money Laundering Act, Investigation for Fair Trial Act, Nacta, and Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act were formulated after 9/11. Counterterrorism strategies were based on a 'capture and kill' approach until the formulation of the National Internal Security Policy. The National Action Plan rearticulated NISP's goals, but converting such ideals into reality needs improved provincial ownership.\n\nSigning four peace accords with militants between 2004 and 2008 proved to be mere appeasement. Though such accords enabled both sides to buy more time, the ultimate casualty was durable peace. The failure of the policy of appeasement reduced the scope for soft approaches, leading to military operations against militants. However, the results of these operations were not worked out well in advance.\n\nInternal security cannot be tackled in isolation.\n\nInternal security threats cannot be neatly separated from external factors. Indian involvement in sabotaging peace in Pakistan is evident from the 240-page Kao Plan. The first part focused on supporting instability in East Pakistan, the remainder concerned KP and Balochistan. Cyberspace facilitated certain elements to wage a hybrid war. Apart from external linkages, such issues are not to be seen exclusively through the prism of security, but also need to be understood through a socioeconomic and political lens.\n\nFor more than a decade, the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan was the common voice of militants. Prior to military operations, extremists used broadcasting to poison the ears of their audience. Initially, TTP commanders were united, but power politics led to factions. After TTP chief Mullah Fazlullah's death, Noor Wali tried to reconsolidate matters, but the military made it is difficult for TTP to stage a comeback with the same intensity. The Sipah-i-Sahaba, Lashkar Jhangvi and Sipah-i-Mohammad were involved in sectarian proxies, while the ENTITY, Balochistan Republican Army, Lashkar-i-Balochistan, Balochistan Liberation United Front and United Baloch Army were significant insurgent groups that challenged internal security. In Sindh, the TTP, AQIS, LeJ and Sipah-i-Mohammad Pakistan remained active. Burmese, Bengalis and Seraiki elements were also active in LeJ. An innovation of some Karachi University students, Ansar-ul-Sharia, was only recently tackled by LEAs.\n\nIn the past four decades, the Fata region remained a hub for militants who challenged the authority of maliks and political agents. Since 2004, KP has registered 4,359 incidents of terrorism; 2009 was the bloodiest period, with 728 attacks recorded. Since 2017, Balochistan registered 333 incidents of terrorism. Militants changed their strategy from suicide bombing to IEDs and rocket fire. Factionalism continued to dilute the strength of militant groups, and some of them opted for clandestine collusion. Karachi remained a hub of ethnic violence and was an attractive shelter for dormant extremists. Though the Karachi operation resulted in an 89 per cent decline in terrorism, the real challenge is how to retain the dividends of ongoing operations. Unrest in Karachi has always been tackled with an iron fist, but the violence reappears after a brief respite.\n\nConverting Fata's merger into reality, consolidating gains of LEAs and preventing ethno-political fissures need political will, a doable transition plan and financial resou­rces. Integrating Levies and Khasadars with the police and redefining the Frontier Constabulary's mandate need more efforts. Although the Fata merger has changed KP's demographic and administrative dynamics, if issues that emerged after the merger are not addressed, it may affect the peace indexation of the settled districts. Weak institutional responses to the dividends of military operations may result in the return of disorder."

Pakistan has faced a very challenging war against terrorism during the last two decades, and now the security situation has improved to a large extent.\n\nThe economic prosperity brought about by the mega projects under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor will defeat the motives of terrorists as, with the success of the project, more employment and business opportunities will be unlocked and people's livelihood will get improved.\n\nMany Chinese projects are in progress under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The security, development and investment situation will improve significantly if tried to address core matters of concern. Deployment of additional troops along the CPEC in the entire country will definitely enhance protection level. The decision came in May days after militants attacked the Pearl Continental luxury hotel in the port city of Gwadar in the restive Balochistan province, killing at least eight people, including four civilians and a Pakistan Navy soldier. The attack was claimed by the ENTITY. The group was also involved in the attack at the Chinese Consulate in Karachi last year. Today's Gwadar is not what it used to be two years ago. In future it will be on par with the ports of developed countries. Gwadar port is one of the focal points of CPEC, with many Chinese workers as well as Pakistanis from other provinces, working at the port.\n\nChina is investing heavily in Balochistan under CPEC. Launched in 2015, CPEC is a planned network of roads, railways and energy projects linking China's resource-rich Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region with Pakistan's strategic Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea.\n\nPakistan is doing its best to create an environment where investors could come and carry out their business in peace, as the security situation has greatly improved. The security situation in Balochistan had improved since the launch of the CPEC and now there is better infrastructure within the province. Pakistan needs to learn lessons from China the way terrorism in Xinjiang is controlled. Recently on the invitation of government of China I have visited Urumqi, Akesu and Kashgar where I have observed that China has controlled terrorism with positive, rational and objective policies. Central and Xinjiang provincial governments have decided to address reasons and factors of enhanced and widespread terrorism in Xinjiang. After keen study and deep observation, China has decided to focus on the development of common people. Standard of living of common deprived Chinese is being improved and uplifted. Basic civic facilities and needs of common Chinese are being ensured. Education with stipends is being provided to the people of the country, particularly Xinjiang. Government of China is focusing on the logical and psychological grooming of mental level of the deprived and disturbed Chinese. Government of China has set up vocational institutes in Xinjiang province for misled and misguided ones. Mislead Chinese are offered two options either to face court trial or to go to vocational institutes for learning and grooming. In the institutes misled ones are offered different professional courses in the best of friendly atmosphere for a year. These Chinese opt to learn refrigeration, wood works, painting, baking, teaching, music and dancing etc. During this time these Chinese are provided best level of sports activities for their mental and physical grooming. Interference in others' life is considered a crime in China. Those who force or influence others are treated by the government of China. After year-long training when these misguided ones become the part of society, they are welcomed positively. They find jobs in the field of their choice. Government plays its role and takes care of each Chinese national.\n\nGovernment of Pakistan needs to open a large number of high standard and most modern schools and vocational institutes across the country, especially in the regions of Gilgit-Baltistan and Balochistan. In the past, these two regions have been ignored and deprived of basic fundamental rights. The powerful lords and tribal leaders had always been against education in their areas. But now time has passed. Pakistan can overcome on the monster of terrorism by opening more and more schools, vocational institutes, colleges and research-based varsities. Free education in the deprived regions will encourage the education seekers to hold books in place of weapons. Free books, breakfast and lunch and stipends for the students should also be made mandatory. This is how we can attract poor Pakistanis to reach institutions for education. We need to groom and brighten brains of young energetic potential Pakistanis. We need to declare health and education emergency. In these institutions free health facilities should be provided. State of Pakistan will have to play its role. State of Pakistan will have to take care of each and every Pakistani. Bearer of slogan of Riasat-e-Madina, Premier Imran Khan, will have to make Pakistan a welfare society to secure future of the country and the nation. Otherwise, other powerful nations will swallow us. It is the obligation of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-led government to address these core issues of the country and the nation on a priority basis."
Balochistan Liberation Army,1,"Several political analysts have also stated that no economic project can be conducted in the region, until a peaceful resolution is found between Islamabad and the Baloch rebels\n\nPakistan has begun the process of raising a division headquarters of the 44 Light Infantry in Gwadar, in a move to address Beijing's growing security concerns over the development of the US $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The ambitious CPEC project involves the undertaking of several infrastructure projects that include the development of road and transport networks, new economic and regulatory zones, and various energy initiatives. By some estimates, the total value of the project is expected to be approximately 20% of Pakistan's total GDP, and as such, claims status as a cornerstone project of Pakistan's economic agenda.\n\nPakistan is acutely aware that any security threat to Chinese investors has the potential to seriously jeopardise the project. In fact, this was made expressly clear by Chinese Vice-President Wang Qishan in May, following two deadly attacks in the region, largely blamed on Balochistan rebels who seek 'liberation' from Pakistan.\n\nIn early May, a group of gunmen stormed a five-star hotel at the strategic port of Gwadar, killing five people. The attack came just a week after an even more deadly attack in which 14 people were killed (including 11 military personnel). Both attacks were claimed by the ENTITY, a separatist organisation that believes that the CPEC project will provide no value to the local community. Indeed, the project has come under intense scrutiny since its inception, with some reports stating that China halted funding into the project in 2017 over corruption charges, despite Pakistan reporting that the project was progressing on schedule.\n\nDespite the implementation of several infrastructural projects, Balochistan remains the least populated and poorest province of Pakistan. The ENTITY has emerged as a key rebel group, conducting insurgency operations for several decades, alleging Islamabad's unfair exploitation of the region's resources. The BLA - as an organisation branded as a terrorist group by the Pakistani government - is firmly opposed to the progression and completion of the CPEC project, and have publicly stated an intention to sabotage it.\n\nFollowing the killing of the Baloch nationalist leader, Nawab Akbar Bugti in 2006, the struggle for the 'Baloch Independence' has intensified, with groups like the BLA and others frequently attacking security installations in the region. Some reports claim that several thousand Baloch people have also gone missing and reports of torture and deaths inflicted on many of them keep surfacing from time to time. Several political analysts have also stated that no economic project can be conducted in the region, until a peaceful resolution is found between Islamabad and the Baloch rebels. The creation of the new division headquarters clearly displays Islamabad's stance on the issue though, as it prepares for further insurgent threats.\n\nThe views expressed by the author are personal and do not in any way represent those of Times Network."
ISIS,1,"President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday the European Union's decision to sanction Turkey over drilling off the coast of Cyprus could disrupt talks with the bloc.\n\nTurkey, a formal candidate to join the EU despite worsening ties, criticized the decision and said it would not cease drilling in the eastern Mediterranean because it is operating on its own continental shelf or areas where Turkish Cypriots have rights.\n\nSpeaking in Ankara ahead of a visit to Washington, Erdogan slammed the EU's decision and said Turkey was acting in line with its rights based on international law. \Hey EU, know this: Turkey is not one of those countries you have come to know until now.

There must be real international solidarity,\"" he said.\n\n\""If everyone starts using these people against each other, we will inevitably see terrorists freeing themselves and doing dangerous things.\""\n\nSpeaking to reporters before a visit to the United States, Erdogan on Tuesday issued a veiled threat suggesting Turkey could release ISIL prisoners it holds and send them to Europe.\n\nThe Turkish leader was angered by an European Union decision to impose sanctions on his country over its drilling for gas in Mediterranean waters off Cyprus.\n\n\""You should revise your stance toward Turkey, which at the moment holds so many ISIL members in prison and at the same time controls those in Syria,\"" Erdogan warned European nations, a day after the EU unveiled a system to sanction Turkey.\n\nHe added: \""These gates will open and these ISIL members who have started to be sent to you will continue to be sent. Then you can take care of your own problem.\""\n\nErdogan has said Turkey is not a \""hotel\"" for ISIL fighters and criticised the West for its reluctance to take back citizens who joined the ranks of the armed group as it sought to establish a \""caliphate\"" in Iraq and Syria in 2014.\n\nTurkey deported citizens of the US, Denmark, and Germany on Monday and announced plans to soon expel seven other German nationals, two Irish citizens, and 11 French nationals.\n\nTurkey said last week about 1,200 ISIL fighters were in Turkish prisons and 287 members - including women and children - were captured during Turkey's military operation in northern Syria, which it launched last month.\n\nWhile Turkey has quietly deported ISIL sympathizers for years, it raised the issue more forcefully after Western nations refused to back its military campaign against Syrian Kurdish fighters, whom Ankara considers to be \""terrorists\"" linked to Kurdish armed groups fighting inside Turkey.\n\nMany countries have voiced concerns the Turkish operation would lead to a resurgence of ISIL."
ISIS,1,"Turkish president angered after EU slapped economic sanctions for violating Cypriot territory\n\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday the European Union's decision to sanction Turkey over drilling off the coast of Cyprus could disrupt talks with the bloc, and he warned Turkey could send captured Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ENTITY) fighters to Europe.\n\nEU foreign ministers on Monday agreed economic sanctions on Ankara for violating Cyprus's maritime economic zone by drilling off the divided island.\n\nTurkey, a formal candidate to join the EU despite worsening ties, criticized the decision and said it would not cease drilling in the eastern Mediterranean because it is operating on its own continental shelf or areas where Turkish Cypriots have rights.\n\nSpeaking in Ankara ahead of a visit to Washington, Erdogan slammed the EU's decision and said Turkey was acting in line with its rights based on international law.\n\n\Hey EU, know this: Turkey is not one of those countries you have come to know until now. We are a country that sits at the negotiating table with you...\"" Erdogan told reporters. \""These negotiations may suddenly end.\""\n\nThe EU relies on Ankara, which hosts more than 3.5 million refugees, to curb the arrival of migrants into Europe following a 2016 agreement to seal off the Aegean sea route. Erdogan has repeatedly warned that Turkey would allow refugees to travel to Europe unless it receives aid from European countries.\n\n\""You may take this lightly, but these doors [to Europe] will open and these [ENTITY] members will be sent to you. Do not try to threaten Turkey over developments in Cyprus,\"" Erdogan said on Tuesday.\n\nThe island of Cyprus was divided in 1974 after a Turkish invasion triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. Since then, several peacemaking efforts have failed and the discovery of offshore resources has complicated the negotiations.\n\nEU ties with NATO-ally Turkey have meanwhile worsened after years of stalemate on Ankara's accession bid. With a worsening record on human rights in the aftermath of a failed coup in 2016, many EU states say Turkey does not meet democratic criteria to join the bloc.\n\nThe decision to impose economic sanctions on Ankara follows a separate move last month to stop arms sales to Turkey over its offensive against the Kurdish YPG militia in northeast Syria. Turkey's western allies have said the offensive could hinder the fight against ENTITY, but Turkey has rejected the claims.\n\nOn Monday, Turkey said it had begun deporting ENTITY members it has captured, starting a program to repatriate the detainees that has further strained ties with its European NATO allies.\n\n\""Whether they accept them or not, we will continue to send them back,\"" Erdogan said on Tuesday, referring to ENTITY detainees."

Zakir Musa,1,"South Asia is witnessing the emergence of a new brand of terrorism, one that can outlive any single leader.\n\n\We must rise above the hero-worshipping, groups, and tandheems and states, and unite for the supremacy of Islam.\"" -- Shahid ENTITY RH\n\nAs evening descended on the Kashmir Valley on August 4, 2019, a deluge of messages flooded into a newly formed Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGH) chat room.\n\nThe previous year-old official chat room had been abandoned a couple of months earlier. Handles were put on delete mode. Operation time was closing in and protocol demanded a fresh new channel to weed out double agents and informers.\n\nThe messages included last-minute instructions, updates about Indian troop and materiel movements, circulation of sat-link files and manuals of offline communication; heartfelt goodbyes to comrades, and reminders to take the time to read the ebooks being shared; and of course, some caustic jokes about mainstream Kashmiri politicians who'd been jailed by the Indian government.\n\nAnd among them sat the aforementioned quote from the group's founder, Zakir Rashid Bhat a.k.a. ENTITY.\n\nThe quote embodies everything that's changed in the jihadist tendencies of the Indian subcontinent. And it foretells how the bloodletting will remain unaffected in the Indian theater, despite the killings of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr-al Baghdadi and his spokesperson Al-Muhajir by the United States late last month.\n\nEssentially, South Asia is witnessing the emergence of a new brand of terrorism. Unencumbered by the strings of foreign state influence, or the weight of partisan politics and regional status quos, the new jihadists of the Islamic State era are driven by a unifying dream that transcends individual leaders.\n\nRooted as they are in the immediate issues of local politics, building as they may be on the fertile soil of long-festering discontent and systematic persecution, they're actively connecting local issues to global ones and building a platform that goes beyond the old demarcations of territorial fiefdoms followed by older jihadist groups.\n\nSharia or Death\n\nBoth in life as a professional jihadi, and in death as a rebel martyr, ENTITY played by the rules of this new game: fluid allegiances and stubborn refusal to let any nation-state dictate the agenda of building the grandest state of them all -- the global Islamic State -- the Caliphate.\n\nA \""homegrown\"" Indian Islamist, he was born Zakir Rashid Bhat in Noorpora in South Kashmir. He lived and studied in the state through high school. Then, like innumerable young Indian men from middle-class families, he gained admission to a private engineering college in 2011-12 -- the Ram Dev Jindal College in Chandigarh.\n\nAcademic straitjackets didn't suit him well. Dropping out barely a year from admission, he returned home to Kashmir and \""disappeared.\""\n\nHe soon resurfaced though -- dressed in fatigues and as a member of the Pakistan-sponsored Hizbul Mujahideen group led by veteran Kashmiri jihadi Syed Mohammed Yusuf Shah, aka Sayeed Salahudeen.\n\nENTITY's bravado, eloquence, and dashing looks, plus the killing of his predecessor Burhan Wani, led him to become commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen in 2016 -- less than three years after joining the outfit full time.\n\nDespite being part of the Hizbul Mujahideen, Wani, ENTITY, and a bulk of the Kashmiri jihadists who made up the post-2010 generation had serious differences with the older generation. They refused to let the quest for an independent Islamist Kashmir be bogged down by quotidian Indo-Pak politics.\n\nFor the younger generation of jihadis, Kashmir and its struggle for independence would be led by sharia and not Kashmiri nationalism which, for them, was a failed cause.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, ENTITY released a video calling for the beheading of the leaders of the Hurriyat Conference. Blaming them and their status quo politics for stalling the implementation of sharia in Kashmir, he said: \""I warn them (Hurriyat leaders). Do not play politics. If you become thorns in our path, we'll kill you before the infidels. We will behead you and hang you in Lal Chowk.\""\n\nAverse to even the slightest strains of separation of religion and statecraft, he asked of the Hurriyat: \""Why do you use our mosques for politics? Why use the holy pulpit to talk about your political struggles? Why come to the funeral of mujahids? We are done with your hypocrisy.\""\n\nWithin hours of the video's release, Saleem Hashmi, Hizbul Mujahideen's spokesman, distanced the organization from ENTITY.\n\nUnfazed, ENTITY hit back, saying: \""If [the] Hizbul Mujahideen does not represent me, I also do not represent the Hizbul Mujahideen.\""\n\nSoon he turned to the Taliban and praised them for putting sharia before nationalism.\n\n\""When we [Kashmiris] fight -- whether with guns or rocks, the fight should be for Islam and not nationalism,\"" he said in another video.\n\nENTITY distanced himself from the Pakistani State, too, and declared the Pakistani flag un-Islamic (for staining the green Islamic flag with a white patch).\n\n\""We want sharia in Kashmir. Neither do we fight for Pakistan nor do we fight for any organization. We fight for Islam. And I ask you to chant slogans of the Taliban because like us, the Taliban too want sharia in Pakistan. We should love the Taliban,\"" he said.\n\nHis separation from Pakistan and Pakistan-based groups made clear, ENTITY and his close-knit team announced to the world on December 7, 2017, that they were now the Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGH) and part of al-Qaeda in the Indian subcontinent (AQIS).\n\nCaught in their struggles for survival in Afghanistan and North Pakistan, the Taliban were in no position to lend any real help. In fact, despite the famous November 2018 speech by al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri titled \""Don't Forget Kashmir,\"" AQIS hadn't been able to independently set a foothold in the region. The Pakistan-based groups continued to hold a monopoly.\n\nMoreover, news emerged that, threatened with destruction at the hands of the Islamic State, the Taliban had opened back-channel talks with Americans, Russians, and Indians -- a fact corroborated publicly by Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat himself in January 2019 during the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi.\n\nBarely two weeks after announcing the formation of the AGH and calling it a part of AQIS, ENTITY released what was to be one of his last videos.\n\nHe declared AGH one with the cause of the Islamic State. He said that in Kashmir they dream of building the Wilayat Kashmir -- contiguous with Wilayat Khurasan in Afghanistan.\n\n\""Shariyat Ya Shahadat,\"" the members of AGH shouted in unison -- sharia or death.\n\nOn the evening of May 23, 2019, a small team picked from three Indian state forces zeroed in on the house of a chemist in a small village called Dadsara. The Indian forces intended to capture ENTITY alive, but negotiations mediated by the chemist failed and ENTITY refused to surrender.\n\nAs night fell, gunfire echoed in the darkness and through the night.\n\nThe Indian forces ended the stalemate early next morning, by firing several rounds of under-barrel grenades from their retrofitted, standard-issue INSAS and AK-47s, reducing the small house to a pile of rubble, and burying the founder of the AGH.\n\nWhen Death Is Inconsequential\n\nJust as U.S. President Donald Trump would months later gloat about the successful killing of al-Baghdadi, the Modi regime hailed its May killing of ENTITY as a death blow to terrorists in Kashmir.\n\nBut unseen by pro-Modi Indian news outlets and fanatical online followers, ENTITY's death was being claimed as a victory on the other side too -- a moral one.\n\nWithin hours of the news of his killing spreading, ENTITY was named a Sheikh and resurrected as a prophetic warrior who now shone like a lodestar for those walking the path of jihad.\n\nOnline channels were flooded with his photos and quotes. Vows to fight and die for Islam as ENTITY had done came from young men, and pledges of ribaat (support for mujahideen fighters) from the older ones.\n\nPolitical grandstanding by mainstream political leaders seeking to reap electoral benefits aside, just like the killing of the Islamic State's founder Abu ENTITYb al-Zarqawi in 2006 and Osama bin Laden's in 2011, ENTITY's killing in 2019 did little to halt the operation of his organization.\n\nLikewise, al-Baghdadi's killing won't dent the Islamic State's work or influence -- especially not in the Indian subcontinent, where Islamist polarization is at an all-time high.\n\nUnlike Kashmiri outfits in the 1990s -- Pakistan-trained and sponsored groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba -- contemporary terrorist networks in the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and India don't depend on foreign funds or training. Individuals in these networks buy into the dream of a global Islamic State-run by sharia -- a utopia of universal Muslim brotherhood peddled by the Zarqawis and the al-Baghdadis of the world. Funds, materiel, and men are all sourced locally.\n\n\""The Islamic State is not an organization -- it's a network,\"" explained Jayant Umranikar. Umranikar served as an overseas agent for India's foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) for 22 years, including a long stint in Pakistan during the heyday of Pakistan-sponsored Kashmiri jihad and the Khalistani separatist movement.\n\n\""You can crush an organization by killing off key members,\"" he said about the Islamic State. \""But how do you kill a network? You don't destroy such a flat and distributed setup by killing individual leaders here and there. Not even the chief!\""\n\nThe progress of ENTITY's AGH is a case in point.Despite burning their bridges with Pakistan, the Hurriyat Conference, and other power players in Jammu and Kashmir, and despite the killing of their founder in May, AGH is today Kashmir's best organized militant group. With the Pakistani state under financial duress and increased pressure from the West, state-supported groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad have all but been wiped out in Kashmir and groups like AGH are filling the vacuum.\n\n\""We are not what we used to be,\"" explained Aslam Majid*.\n\nMajid, a former officer of Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), began his career as a deputy in the Karachi range and was in charge of keeping tabs on local politics. Now living in retirement in the United States, he rose through the ranks of the organization and was assigned the role of liaising with Kashmir-focused outfits -- chief among them the Hizbul Mujahideen.\n\n\""We weren't perfect -- no intel agency is,\"" Majid continued. \""[The] Indians had moles in our outfit, and they often did preempt cross-border movements. But we had the budget, and Kashmiris in Indian-occupied territory had real grievances. So we always had more than enough supply of young men willing to martyr themselves for the Kashmiri cause. But they needed training and some funds. And all we had to do was provide those. It worked well. And hordes of Kashmiris from the Pakistan side crossed into the Indian side -- more than what the Indians could handle.\n\nBut now, partly because of the economic slowdown, and mainly because of a crop of corrupt officers who are busy lining their own pockets, there just isn't enough money to train irregulars. Why irregulars? There isn't even enough money for the welfare of regular officers, I'd say!\""\n\n\""Times have changed and so has militancy -- whether in Kashmir or elsewhere,\"" said celebrated military scientist Dr. Ayesha Siddiqa, one of the foremost experts on the Pakistani military establishment, speaking to The Diplomat in an interview from London.\n\n\""There are state actors and nonstate actors. And there are those who are in the middle. Ones with semi-legitimate existence,\"" she said, speaking of outfits like the Lashkar-e-Taiba. \""Their work is in many ways circumscribed by establishment agenda. But the young lot is restive. And also pragmatic. Hence the emergence of these new groups that would rather align with the Islamic State than with the traditional organizations.\""\n\nNot only is AGH the largest and most active group in the Kashmir Valley today, but it has also evolved to truly flourish in a changing environment. The absence of leaders who hog all the limelight all the time and centralize all decision making makes the cadres more autonomous. Members work in constantly changing cells and groups. And the line between a member and a sympathizer is a blurred one. This helps people work from where they are and chip in with whatever skill or access they have. Moreover, this loose nature of association helps individuals stay anonymous and thereby conduct better intelligence gathering.\n\nLong before the \""surprise\"" disconnection of the internet and abrogation of Article 370 and 35A was announced by India, AGH agents and informers responsible for different beats began compiling intelligence into the common group chat.\n\n\""...there is a lot of movement of Indian planes going on...mostly the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III...India is either planning to do something or just preparing for the storm that is about to come...\""\n\n\""Yasin Malik is fine in Tihar...don't pay attention to rumors\""\n\n\""Net slowed down in South Kashmir...\""\n\n\""Know your weapons...spread the knowledge\"" [This was shared with instruction manuals on how to identify and use different makes and models of guns]\n\nThe strongest proof of their preparedness came at six minutes past nine on the night of August 4.\n\nA configuration file for the satellite links they would use to dodge the impending internet blockage was shared. Immediately after, instructions were sent out to install FireChat -- a messaging service that uses near-field communication and not the internet.\n\nEasy to follow infographics about hardening Android phones, making and installing bots, and surveillance self-defense \""how-tos\"" were already abundant within the group. Just before logging off, reminders were sent to review such manuals.\n\nThis flurry of activity in advance of the internet blockage on August 5 demonstrates two key points: First, the AGH was not only prepared but had managed to infiltrate some key parts of the Indian state machinery beyond Kashmir; second, the AGH is capable of fighting a new kind of war in this era of new technology without explicit support from the Pakistani military -- and with little more than smartphones and open source tools.\n\nAcross South Asia, the stories of the rise of the broader Islamic State network aren't all that different.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Easter Sunday bombings in Colombo, the Sri Lankan government claimed there was a clear foreign hand at play. They haven't presented evidence to back that claim. Independent investigations by this reporter showed that the C4 charges, communication systems, training, logistics, funding, and everything else was essentially homegrown.\n\nSimilarly in Bangladesh, except Tamim Chowdhary who was little more than an organizer, none of those who carried out the massacre at Holey Artisan or built suicide squads had ever received any direct training or financial aid from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nIn the Maldives -- the South Asian country with the highest number of mujahideen volunteers who traveled or attempted to travel to Syria and Iraq -- sympathizers built their Islamic State network with no direct intervention from the shura council in Mosul.\n\nAll that these groups had from the central Islamic State was an ideological framework and a dream -- one shared by the new jihadists of South Asia -- of a utopian Islamic Caliphate that transcends boundaries drawn by secular, Western creations like nation-states.\n\nEven in the United States and Europe, the overwhelming majority of people alleged to be members of the Islamic State, or having traveled or attempted to travel to Syria, were all \""inspired.\""\n\nThis \""inspiration\"" model has far outlived the Islamic State's founder Zarqawi. And it will outlive al-Baghdadi and his successors.\n\nEven after the United States released unflattering videos that depicted Zarqawi as far from a tough guy, fumbling with an AK-47, little changed. Even after his spectacular assassination, hordes of foreign fighters joined the war in Syria and Iraq.\n\nFor the modern jihadist, the dream of the Islamic State and its promised land is larger than its supremo.\n\nThe Promised Status\n\nWhat the Islamic State proffers is not just a promised land like innumerable prophets and cults have in history. There is also a more immediate gratification on offer -- visibility, adulation, and acceptance.\n\n\""See, for the longest time, the Pakistanis and Arabs looked at the Bengalis with mistrust and contempt,\"" explained Probir Bagchi*.\n\nA private adviser with the National Security Advisory Board of India, Bagchi worked as a liaison between the Indian and Bangladeshi governments and was a keeper of back channels with Bengali mujahideen fighters.\n\n\""Bangladeshi mujahids, for example, may have volunteered to fight in the Afghan war against the Soviets. They may have tied up with Pak-based or ISI-sponsored outfits. Some have even worked under bin Laden's al-Qaeda regime. But the Organization of Islamic States never forgave the Bengalis for breaking up an Islamic nation-state in 1971.\n\nAnd that historical stigma has made them the lower caste among the global jihadist movement. Claiming to be part of the Islamic State is like graduating to being Brahmins in the world of global jihad.\""\n\nCoarse as the allegory may be, the truth is coarser still and not even allegorical.\n\nThe Islamic State's founder, Zarqawi, had to overcome two major social handicaps. He did not have a pedigree with major value and he was Jordanian -- a country which has long been seen as a bastard nation by jihadists, created to drive a wedge in the Islamic world.\n\nZarqawi, the nobody, had to earn his recognition through bloody excess when the world's attention was focused on Osama bin Laden, the multi-billionaire Saudi.\n\nClaims of worldwide unity and brotherhood notwithstanding, next to no Bangladeshi, Maldivian, or southern Indian Muslim has ever come close to leadership positions through the decades of jihad in Afghanistan and Kashmir. The relegation of darker-skinned Muslims to menial jobs, while the sheikhs rolled in wealth and power, remained unbroken in both mainstream civilian-political life, and jihad.\n\nMoreover, even though Islam doesn't formally recognize castes, Muslims in South Asia are not far removed from the caste hierarchies that afflict Hinduism and other faiths in the region. Through the 1980s and '90s, as petrodollar capitalism burgeoned and remittances grew, feudal hierarchies consolidated into new wealth, privilege, and positions of power.\n\nAs a result in South Asia, both in mainstream political parties or in jihadist and extremist groups, caste, class, and lineage still determine whether or not a member rises to the top.\n\n\""For the longest time, it's been an unwritten policy in the ISI that no one of Bengali or Indian origin is to rise to the top,\"" explained Bagchi. \""Even Kashmiris -- whether from the Indian side or the other -- are kept to militant groups and used as cannon fodder. Positions of power are exclusively for the purer Punjabi and Sindhi bloodlines.\""\n\nAt the international level, acting as the chief liaison between the rich Arab world and poor South Asians, Pakistan's elite became the gatekeeper of jihad in South Asia. And they had the monopoly to decide who got how much funding and who rose to jihadi stardom and who history forgot.\n\nThe Islamic State ruined that monopoly.\n\nTamim Chowdhary was a Bengali-Canadian. He went to Syria, pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi, and then took charge of operations in Dhaka. He needed no Pakistani, Saudi or any other nation-state's approval to be called the Emir of Bengal.\n\nChowdhary forged his teams by both recruiting fresh young men who, like Zarqawi and ENTITY, were nobodies and aspired to jihadi stardom. He poached freely from the ranks of older Pakistan and al-Qaeda aligned groups that had been left to wilt.\n\nThis is noteworthy at a time when the elites of the world -- from the United States to Europe to India -- are pumping xenophobia into everyday political rhetoric, a time when establishment politicians are devising new ways of keeping migrants out -- from walls on the U.S.-Mexico border to sprawling detention centers in India, on to zero refugee policies in the rich Islamic sultanates of the Middle East. The Islamic State under al-Baghdadi made Abu Hassan al-Muhajir -- meaning Abu Hassan \""the migrant\"" -- their spokesperson and named him an honorary sheikh.\n\nThe appeal of the apparent egalitarianism of the Islamic State, which has opened its doors to Muslims everywhere, is all the more attractive set next to a bevvy of closed doors elsewhere.\n\nPostscript\n\nAt the time of this article going to press, the Islamic State's official channels named both a new Caliph and a new spokesperson -- Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi and Abu Hamza al-Qurayshi respectively.\n\nIn his rousing inaugural speech, the new spokesperson says: \""There is no reason for the apostates and infidels to celebrate...the mujahideen from East and West are rising against the tyrants of both the Arab and the non-Arab world...\""\n\nAnd within hours of the speech and the text coming out, it's been translated to Urdu, Hindi, Bangla, and Tamil and broadcast to language-specific group chats.\n\n*Names of some agents have been changed to protect identities."
Zakir Musa,1,"SRINAGAR: Terror group Ansar Ghazwat-ul Hind (AGH), an offshoot of global terror outfit Al Qaeda, has joined hands with Islamic State of Jammu and Kashmir (ISJK) to carry out joint attacks on the Indian security forces operating in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nAccording to intelligence agencies, the two terror outfits are on the verge of being completely wiped out due to heightened military operations by the security forces in the Kashmir Valley with most of their leadership eliminated one by one.\n\nBoth AGH and ISJK are extremely short of ammunition and hence the two outfits are planning to launch a joint attack on the security forces and loot their weapons.\n\nThe recent terror attacks in Shopian and Bijbehara are proof that these outfits are desperate to attack the security establishment and loot their ammunition.\n\nThe inputs gathered by the intelligence agencies suggest that the two terror outfits have now decided to target the road-opening parties of the security forces.\n\nSecurity forces had recently killed Abdul Hameed Lelhari, the successor of slain terrorist ENTITY and AGH commander, in an encounter in Tral.\n\nAfter his elimination in the Tral encounter, Burhan Koka has been named as the new commander of the terror outfit.\n\nThe Jammu Kashmir DGP Dilbag Singh had said that AGH has been wiped out from Jammu and Kashmir after Lelhari's killing in Tral.\n\n\As of now, Ansar Ghazwat-ul Hind group (AGH) has been wiped out,\"" DGP Singh said on Wednesday.\n\nHe, however, noted that it is possible that the AGH would re-emerge in future. Lelhari and two other terrorists were killed by security forces on Tuesday. It is to be noted that Lelhari was heading Al-Qaida linked Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind after the killing of ENTITY.\n\nAccording to Jammu and Kashmir Police, Lelhari and two other terrorists were working in coordination with Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad.\n\n\""In Tral, 3 local militants associated with Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind were killed yesterday. You would recall that when ENTITY was killed, the command of this group was handed over to Hameed Lelhari,\"" Singh had said.\n\nHe added that Lelhari took to terrorism in 2016 and was involved in several terror attacks in Kashmir valley.\n\nDGP Singh said that despite apprehensions expressed by some that more youth from Kashmir Valley will join terrorism after the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, the pace of recruitment for terrorist activities has been quite slow.\n\nThe DGP also rejected reports that the Centre is once again planning to ban the use of mobile phones in Kashmir Valley.\n\n\""Through launching pads near Line of Control (LoC), Pakistan Army & ISI are involved in pushing in the maximum number of militants towards Indian side,\"" he was quoted as saying by ANI."

According to the statement, Ghazi Khalid Ibrahim is announced as the new interim commander. The group also named Abu Bakr Shopiani and Umar Mansour as deputies. 30-year-old Hamid Lelhari, a native of Pulwama, was named the new commander of Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGH) after ENTITY's death on May 23, 2019\n\nEarlier, Jammu and Kashmir DGP Dilbag Singh addressed a press conference in Srinagar, saying that Ansar Ghazwat-ul Hind group had been completely \wiped out.\""\n\nAwantipora Encounter\n\nOn October 22, three terrorists were killed in an encounter with security forces in Awantipora.

He also said that terrorism can only be curbed if the local youth of Kashmir do not take the path of militancy and choose the path of peace.\n\nWho was ENTITY\n\nENTITY was the top militant commander in the Kashmir Valley. He headed the Al Qaeda affiliate AGH who was killed by the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district. ENTITY was also a close associate of Burhan Wani who was gunned down by the forces in 2017. ENTITY succeeded Burhan and later headed the al-Qaida affiliate. Like Burhan Wani, ENTITY used to express his opinions through social media. ENTITY had taken to militancy in 2013. The killing of ENTITY is seen as a massive success for the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir."
Zakir Musa,1,"I appeared as a witness at a US Congressional hearing on Human Rights in South Asia: Views from the State Department and the Region\. But I wasn't allowed to complete what I had to say. Here are my complete opening remarks:\n\nOne of the most important tenets of human rights is, and I quote, \""Wherever men and women are persecuted because of their race, religion, or political views, that place must -- at that moment -- become the center of the universe.\"" That was Elie Wiesel in the context of the Jewish Holocaust when the world for the longest time remained silent and chose to ignore the cries of Jews in the Nazi Germany. The discernment that this committee has shown towards human rights in South Asia, therefore, is commendable. I would like to express my gratitude to Subcommittee Chairman Brad Sherman and Ranking Member Ted Yoho for inviting me to appear as a witness in this august house today.\n\nSince as a journalist, I have worked mostly in the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir, I will speak for its people and leave it to my co-panelists to speak about the grave human rights violations committed in other countries of South Asia, especially Pakistan's provinces of Balochistan and Sindh.\n\nAlthough, I am myself, one of the persecuted Kashmiris who grew up in destitution as a refugee, I do not speak here as a representative of my community, which was driven out and ethnically cleansed from Kashmir in 1990 because of our religious identity. I am here as a conscientious journalist who believes that the role of the journalist is to be a watchdog of society and to be a voice of the voiceless and the powerless. So I will speak here nothing but the complete truth.\n\nI have to say that most of what you read in the Western press and some sections of the Indian media is a distorted reality about Kashmir. While they are rightly highlighting instances of violations committed by the Indian state, the story is often presented without context, without an understanding of history and nuance, but it carries certitude and self righteousness of a certain narrative that helps the perpetrator and not the victim of abuse in Kashmir.\n\nSo let me tell you who the victim and who the perpetrator of human rights abuse in Kashmir is. The victim is my Kashmiri Muslim friend and colleague, Shujaat Bukhari. Who was Shujaat? A senior journalist and peace activist who believed in resolving Kashmir through dialogue between India and Pakistan. Shujaat went from one capital city to another in the world trying to convince powerful players that Kashmir needed to be peaceful for the sake of the future of his own and everyone's children in Kashmir.\n\nSeveral years ago, Shujaat and I met here in the US, spending a whole day discussing how we could put an end to the violence that had destroyed both Hindus and Muslims in Kashmir. I heard him say that he as a Kashmiri Muslim wanted his children to grow up in the progressive and plural Kashmir that it used to be while we were growing up in Kashmir. At the end of the day, we parted ways, on the hopeful note that one day Kashmir will be peaceful and we all will live together as we used to once upon a time. We met several times in Delhi in the last few years debating and discussing Kashmir, as we had resolved to. The last time we spoke on phone, he complained that I had been visiting Kashmir during every crisis but didn't drop by to say hello. I promised I would see him in my next visit. Shujaat didn't keep his part of the promise. On June 14, 2018, Shujaat, my friend, was shot dead outside his office in the Press Enclave area of Srinagar. Who shot him dead? Lashkar-e-Taiba. The same banned Pakistani terror group responsible for the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. Why did they kill him? Because Shujaat wanted Pakistan to end the violence and human rights abuse in Kashmir. They killed him because he wanted peace.\n\nWho is the victim in Kashmir? The victim is 65-year-old Ghulam Mohi-ud-din Mir of Parimpora, Srinagar, who as a businessman would pay all his profits in zakat/charity, year after year, to the poor in Kashmir. But just weeks ago, on August 29th, he was shot dead. By whom? By Pakistan sponsored terrorists. Why? Because he had dared to open his shop, defying the orders of Jaish-e-Mohammad--the same terror group responsible for the kidnapping and beheading of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in 2002. Jaish, in the last two months has been issuing posters warning Kashmiri Muslims not to resume their normal life. The victim is that five-year-old Asma Jan who along with her father and two others were shot on September 6. Why? Because they defied the militant diktat and tried to sell apples, the only source of income for their family. They were killed because of the militant imposed shutdown.\n\nSo who are the victims of human rights violations in Kashmir? The victims are those 15000 Kashmiri Muslims who have been killed by Pakistan sponsored militants in the last 30 years, but no press and no human rights activist in the world thinks that it is their moral obligation to talk or write about them. The victims are the silent majority in Kashmir, who have been persecuted for siding with humanity, pluralism, compassion, democracy, and peace.\n\nThe victims are those whose sons and brothers are working with local police trying to defend Kashmir against Pakistan's 30-year-old project of Islamist jihad, terror and violence. The victim is Mohammad Ayub Pandith, a Kashmiri police officer, who was lynched to death, by the supporters of Pakistan and ENTITY, the former Hizbul Mujahideen militant who founded the provincial branch of al Qaeda in Kashmir. Why was Ayub lynched to death? Because ENTITY supporters suspected that he was an Indian agent. The victim in Kashmir is every single Kashmiri Muslim who on election day goes out to vote for his legislator, who swears by the Constitution of India and who sends his son to join the local police or Indian Army, defying the militant threats.\n\nThe victims in Kashmir are those Muslims who believe that it is possible to be both Muslim and Indian, to be both peaceful and yet assertive constitutionally, to be both religious and yet live peacefully with other religions.\n\nThe victims are those 35 Sikhs who were massacred in Chittisinghpura and 791 Pandits who were killed because of their faith. The victims are the over 300,000 Pandits, the indigenous Hindus of Kashmir, who were cleansed from the region through a campaign of violence, rape, and terror. More people have died at the hands of Pakistani terrorists than any other reason. In Kashmir, the real killer is terrorism.\n\nThese victims of human rights abuse, unfortunately, have not found column space in NYT or Washington Post. These victims do not have a representative or a spokesperson among any of the intellectual, academic and human rights cliques.\n\nBut who is the perpetrator? Only one entity -- the Islamic Republic of Pakistan -- a military-led, theocratic state that wears the veil of democracy and whose power is derived only by killing Kashmiri Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs through their local proxies in Kashmir, by killing Baloch Muslims in Balochistan, by killing Afghan Muslims in Afghanistan, by killing Ahmedis and Shias in Pakistan, so that they feel assured about their strength as a fascistic state. Incidentally, today marks the first dark day of Pakistan's systematic campaign to annihilate people of Kashmir when it sent its invaders to rape, torture, kill and plunder Kashmir. Thank you.\n\nWritten Statement for the Record\n\nSubmitted at the United States House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1947, after India's Partition, Pakistani armed forces and Pashtun tribesmen attacked the Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), comprising of three ethnically diverse regions -- Jammu, Ladakh and Kashmir. The state bordering Pakistan to its West and Tibet on its East became part of India when its ruler decided to seek India's military help and signed a legal instrument of accession with India. The political leadership of Kashmir (a Muslim majority region) at the time supported the accession.\n\nIndian forces were deployed to counter the invasion, but Pakistan managed to occupy a considerable part of the state. In 1948, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 47, requiring all Pakistani military personnel and tribesmen to be withdrawn from the region before a plebiscite could be held. A plebiscite would have resulted in Kashmiris voting to join India. However, contrary to the requirements of Resolution 47, Pakistan increased its military presence, and no plebiscite was held. In the area of Kashmir occupied by Pakistan, known as Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK), over 40,000 Hindu families were forced to flee the invading Pashtun tribesmen. Pakistan, in all, has initiated three additional conventional wars with India in an attempt to invade Jammu & Kashmir and seize it by force.\n\nIn 1988, during the Cold War, while the US-funded mujahideen (Taliban) fought the Soviet Union in Afghanistan with the help of Pakistan, General Zia ul Haq's regime began training Islamists to launch jihad in Kashmir. By the time the US withdrew from Afghanistan, leaving Pakistan's military and intelligence service with unaccountable funds, arms and ammunition, an Islamabad sponsored insurgency engulfed the Kashmir Valley. Former Pakistani ambassador to the US, Husain Haqqani, in his books has documented how the ISI-supported jihad in Kashmir was \""rooted in the ideology of Pakistani Islamists, carefully nurtured for decades by the Pakistani military.\""\n\nSince 1990, about a thousand Hindus and nearly 15,000 Kashmiri Muslims who disagreed with Islamist jihad and the cause of Kashmir's secession from India, have been killed by Pakistani sponsored militants. In confronting the Pakistan sponsored militancy, the Indian army and state police have also committed grave human rights abuses. However, what the Indian state has done pales in comparison to what the foot-soldiers of the Pakistani military and ISI have done to ordinary Kashmiri Muslims in the last 30 years.\n\nIn the last 30 years, militants killed more Kashmiri Muslim civilians than the members of any other community in Kashmir.\n\nSpecifically, the militants:\n\nAccording to Ambassador Haqqani, the Pakistan-sponsored insurgency sought to cleanse Kashmir of non-Muslims to make the state entirely free of minorities. As a result, over 300,000 Kashmiri Pandits (Hindus) were ethnically cleansed from the Valley (over 95% of the Valley's indigenous Hindu population) from 1989 to 1991 in a systematic campaign of targeted killings, rape, threats, and destruction of properties and religious sites. In the ensuing three decades, thousands of displaced Pandits have lived in dilapidated camps in Jammu and New Delhi, while the central government of several administrations has failed to safely rehabilitate them.\n\nMilitant violence in Kashmir reached its peak in 2001, and then drastically declined in subsequent years, leading to an upsurge in tourism, which brought an estimated 1.5 million tourists to Kashmir in 2012 alone. At the same time, support for the insurgency started waning, as voter participation in panchayat (village councils) and statewide elections significantly increased. Many former militants were rehabilitated and reintegrated into society, with some entering politics, such as Farooq Ahmed Dar, who on camera admitted to killing dozens of Kashmiri Hindus, after which he forgot the count. However, Pakistan continued to foment violence in the state and launch cross-border attacks. The period coincided with Islamic radicalization through mosques, mushrooming of extremist schools of Islam like Jamaat-e-Islami, Deoband, and Wahhabism in Kashmir, and in the last decade, smart phones and internet access opened new floodgates to self-radicalization. Since the emergence of ISIS and its social media propaganda, Islamic radicalization in Kashmir has reached new heights, something prominent Kashmiri Muslim political leaders have warned against.\n\nMany terror groups active in Kashmir today, such as Lashkar-eTaiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), and Hizbu-ul-Mujahideen (HM) have rightfully been labelled Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the European Union, United States, and other countries. Yet these terrorists continue to receive safe harbor, medical care, and financial support in Pakistan-exactly like Al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin-Laden who was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan by US Special Forces in 2011. These groups have launched terror attacks throughout India, including the November 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed over 165 people, and the September 2016 attack on an Indian army base, which lead to an escalation in tensions between India and Pakistan. The following are just a few high-profile incidents of Pakistani-sponsored terror:\n\nAccording to the US State Department, Pakistan has committed gross human rights violations in the part of Kashmir it occupies. In PoK, Kashmiris have held large protests alleging human rights violations by Pakistan's military and ISI such as extrajudicial killings of Kashmiri activists, rigged elections, and repression of political activists.\n\nOn August 5, the Indian government passed legislation in both houses of parliament-with support from a wide array of political parties-to remove Articles 370 and 35A of India's Constitution. The removal of these temporary articles sought to better integrate the residents of Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh into the rest of India. In particular, it would provide Kashmiris with equal protection under the law and all the rights other Indian citizens enjoy, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, religion, or social class. It would also give Kashmiris access to better educational and economic opportunities. Finally, the removal of Articles 370 and 35A is expected to facilitate the rehabilitation and resettlement of the ethnically cleansed Kashmiri Pandit population in the Kashmir Valley.\n\nJammu and Kashmir was also divided into two Union Territories: one for Jammu and Kashmir, and one for Ladakh. The creation of a Union Territory in Ladakh had been a long time demand of the people of the region, who complained of being socially and economically marginalized by state policies that favored the Kashmir Valley.\n\nGround Situation Post-370\n\nWith credible intelligence reports about terror attacks and mob rioting by over ground workers of terror groups, the government imposed restrictions on movement and a blockade on communication, which caused massive inconvenience and discomfort to the people in Kashmir Valley. Initially, because of the blockade, it was challenging even for the press, including me, to report from Kashmir. Though the government lifted restrictions on movement, restored landlines, and now has restored post-paid mobile phones as well, mobile internet, remains suspended.\n\nAfter two weeks of the government imposed shutdown, Pakistan backed terror groups -- Hizbul Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Jaish-e-Mohammad -- issued threats by circulating and pasting posters against the resumption of business and normal life.\n\nMilitants also engaged in the following violence against Kashmiri civilians:\n\nAs a result, the situation in Kashmir has turned into a civil curfew imposed by militants and their over ground workers. Though educational institutions were opened, students have mostly stayed home. The new normal of the markets in Kashmir is that shops open early in the morning at 6 am and shut down by 9 am and reopen at 6 pm and close by 9 pm. On some days, shops extend their hours to 11 am and evening hours begin at 4 pm, leading to traffic jams in the city. Even as the upscale markets and businesses remain shut, vegetable and fruit hawkers, pharmacies, and small vendors on the roadside, have stayed open all day from the very beginning. Businessmen who own shops in the high-end markets are also selling their products in flea bazaars. However, tourism has been badly hit because of an initial advisory to domestic tourists by the government.\n\nViolent Protests\n\nAcross the Valley, over 200 incidents of stone-pelting, mob rioting, and violence were reported in the months of August and September. Most of them were concentrated in a few pockets of Srinagar district. Over 50 protestors received pellet injuries in clashes with security forces, according to official sources. While hundreds were detained under preventive custody, 102 people have been arrested under the Public Safety Act in the two months.There has been wide coverage about the violent rioters and the injured in both Indian and international press. Human rights activists in India have also been speaking about the abuses committed by the rioters and arsonists at every platform inside and outside the country.\n\nAre violent protests in Kashmir about Article 370?\n\nNone of the violent protests in Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370, have been about the constitutional change that the government of India brought in relation to J&K. None of the protests have demanded restoration of J&K's flag or its constitution. Instead, in all the protests, protestors waved only Islamic or Pakistani flags and raised Islamic or pro-Pakistan and pro-separatist slogans, seeking separation from India.\n\nIn the biggest protest in Kashmir since August 5, protestors raised slogans of ENTITY, the slain founder of provincial branch of Al-Qaeda in Kashmir. Also, Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front, Hizbul Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, Wilayah-al-Hind (Islamic State of Jammu & Kashmir), and their supporters who are at the forefront of these violent protests, have never believed in the Constitution of India or Jammu and Kashmir. None of them have been proponents or supporters of Article 370. Instead, militants and their over ground supporters (both sponsored by Pakistan) have persistently demanded only one thing, that is, secession from India.\n\nCan violence be dissent? Can perpetrators of violence be victims of human rights violations?\n\nIn the last 30 years, the majority in Kashmir has been silenced by the barrel of the gun that Pakistan has aimed on Kashmir. Many prominent leaders and intellectuals of Kashmir who disagreed with Pakistan's cross border terrorism or militant violence, have been silenced by bullets. Anyone among the intelligentsia who advocates peace has been gagged.\n\nBut ironically, the perpetrator of violence in Kashmir has been projected as the victim of human rights abuse; violence and threats of violence have been presented as dissent. In none of the great democracies like the United States, or those in Europe, have terror acts especially sponsored by a rival state, been legitimized by calling it dissent. In a democracy, expression of dissent or disagreement is not possible amidst intimidation and extreme violence. But it is a travesty that the world press, which completely ignores or is not even aware of the history and context of Kashmir and violence in the region, has unwittingly come to justify the perpetrators of Mumbai terror attacks and September 11. It is also disingenuous that when it has been amply established that terrorism in Kashmir is sponsored by Pakistan, a theocratic military state with pretensions of a democracy, the criticism is deflected by calling terror groups like JeM, LeT and HM as non-state actors. Husain Haqqani and Arif Jamal have documented how Kashmir-centric terror groups enjoy complete protection and patronage of the Pakistani military and ISI.\n\nKashmiri society has been under siege for the last three decades because of Pakistan's proxy war in Kashmir. In an atmosphere of fear and dread, Kashmir has lost its voice and it speaks up only during elections when it votes, and then too only if there is a sense of security. Because of the fear of Pakistan sponsored violence, the dominant narrative remains critical of human rights violations committed by the Indian security forces. It is absolutely necessary that Indian forces are held accountable and prosecuted, but it is also important that Kashmiris have the sense of security to speak freely and fearlessly about the colossal abuse they have suffered at the hands of Pakistan sponsored militant violence.\n\nKashmiris, as of now, are caught in a 'spiral of silence', a process first theorized by German political scientist Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann in the context of German electorate in 1965. Spiral of silence is a phenomenon in which one opinion becomes so forcefully dominant, that those disagreeing refuse to speak up due to fear of harm or social isolation from holders of the dominant opinion, and thereby fail to realize that their disagreement actually forms a majority. This theory draws from the Lockesian view that humans are social animals and are therefore afraid of isolation in their environment. Individuals constantly look for their own purpose, meaning, relevance, popularity, respect, and integration in the society they live in. That requires the individuals to extend huge importance to their society's opinions and approval.\n\n\""Individuals who when observing their environments notice that their own personal opinion is spreading and taken over by others, will voice this opinion self-confidently in public. On the other hand, individuals who notice that their own opinions are losing ground, will be inclined to adopt a more reserved attitude when expressing their opinions in public.\"" The supporters of one opinion becomes confident, articulate, and can even turn vociferous while the proponents of the other opinion will retreat, withdraw and turn silent, especially in an environment ridden with intimidation, violence and death. Silence, in such scenarios, becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nNeumann warns that \""there is a definite influence on the environment; an opinion that is being reinforced in this way appears stronger than it really is, while an opinion suppressed as described will seem to be weaker than it is in reality. The result is a spiral process which prompts other individuals to perceive the changes in opinion and to follow suit, until one opinion has become established as the prevailing attitude while the other opinion will be pushed back and rejected by everybody with the exception of the hard core that nevertheless sticks to that opinion.\""\n\nThis problem of perception that drives a public opinion leads to a complication called accuracy of people's environmental perceptions. The tendency of people to believe that others agree with them is seen as a pattern called the 'looking glass perception'. In a study on racism, Fields and Schuman, for example, found that those supporting racial equality and civil liberties were actually in the majority but were rarely believed to be a majority by themselves or by others in the sample. This situation when a minority position in public opinion is incorrectly perceived to be the majoritarian view has been termed as 'pluralistic ignorance'.\n\nThis presents a huge challenge. Are the most dominant narratives in a conflict even majoritarian? Do violent movements represent the majority or the minority? If a Kashmiri Muslim is being silenced by the sword hanging on his head-that he is not a true Muslim if he speaks up against the Muslim who riddled his son or father with bullets-can there be an intellectually honest debate about human rights? Is the non-state really non-state when we know that the bullet that recently killed a 65-year-old Kashmiri Muslim shopkeeper came from Pakistan Army?\n\nThe reality on the ground is that the majority in Kashmir seek and observe peace and they will speak up only when the atmosphere is conducive. Since August 5th, the only violence that has been committed in Kashmir is by Pakistan sponsored militants and separatists, not the majority that abides by the rule of law. Human rights in Kashmir is not about the suspension of mobile and internet services; it's about the struggle of those who want to live freely and fearlessly and those who don't want them to live. Pakistan wants Kashmiri Muslims to die for an Islamic cause while Kashmir wants to live for a better future for its children.\n\nSo in any debate on human rights violations, it is important to identify who the real perpetrators and the victims of abuse are. In Kashmir's case, Pakistan is clearly the biggest violator of human rights. Pakistan therefore has no legal or moral authority to speak of human rights violations in Kashmir while India has lost thousands of Kashmiri citizens and soldiers to the violence Pakistan has perpetrated.\n\nThe revocation of special status of J&K strengthens human rights\n\nIndia chose to be a secular, democratic republic, unlike Pakistan which chose to be a theocratic state, that today is run by its military while attempting to maintain a civilian face. As a secular republic, with a strong union, constitutionally, India's vision for itself is to promote egalitarianism, equality where everyone has individual freedom to be who they are. Now for India to accept a special status for a state only because its a Muslim majority, is in direct contradiction with its philosophy and future outlook.\n\nIndia rejected Mohammad Ali Jinnah's two nation theory and the idea of Pakistan which propounded that Hindus and Muslims cannot coexist. The founding fathers of the Republic fought against the exclusivity of religious groups and rejected it in unequivocal terms in 1947.\n\nUntil the revocation of its special status and its separate constitution, Jammu and Kashmir was in the same league as 27 countries like Saudi Arabia, Syria, Sudan, and Somalia which limit a woman's ability to pass on citizenship to her child or spouse, if she was married to a non-J&K resident. J&K, a constitutionally privileged state in India, had reduced women to second class citizens, under its permanent residency laws guaranteed by Article 35A. J&K's laws also barred West Pakistan refugees from living in J&K since Partition and from acquiring state subject rights. The state also denied thousands of descendants of Dalits, who were brought in from Punjab as government sweepers in 1957, from getting any government jobs other than sweepers.\n\nIn a society still plagued by caste discrimination, the state laws ensured that the sweeper community could not even get a Scheduled Caste certificate from the state government. As a result, they were rendered ineligible for all the benefits under federal social programs too. Hindu and Sikh refugees from West Pakistan remained non-permanent resident second-class citizens. The abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A has put an end to the era of misogynistic and xenophobic attitudes that the state promoted in the last seven decades.\n\nAmerican foreign policy in South Asia has hurt human rights and democracy in the region\n\nBecause Pakistan made itself useful to the US during the Cold War, the US has consistently enabled and empowered Pakistani military establishment to wage war against democratic India, including by means of a vast network of Islamist terror groups. This has included US Presidents falsely certifying that Pakistan was not pursuing nuclear weapons, when in fact it was, so that it could continue to receive American military hardware that had no purpose other than to assault India. Pakistan has used American cooperation to develop a nuclear umbrella from behind which it has carried out a 30 year campaign of Islamic terrorism directed against India, which has become an all consuming crisis for India and has galvanised India into taking whatever steps are necessary to defend itself from terrorism that Pakistan has carried out with American patronage.\n\nThis has hurt the US as it now finds itself trapped in the longest war in its history thanks to Pakistan using the resources it acquired under American patronage against America itself. Pakistan's sponsorship of the Taliban from behind its nuclear curtain has left America hostage in Afghanistan to Pakistan, neither able to force Pakistani cooperation nor able to complete its mission, nor able to withdraw without Afghanistan once again becoming Pakistan's terror factory.\n\nDespite this history, many sections of the US political class and Western media are found censuring India while giving a free pass to Pakistan. This has happened even when the Pakistani Prime Minister made clear that Pakistan's activities in Kashmir are an Islamic struggle or jihad. These sections of the press and political class have rarely, if ever, acknowledged the ethnic cleansing of the Hindus of Kashmir-the indigenous people of Kashmir-by Pakistani sponsored terrorists. They have never asked that if it is a struggle for Kashmiri independence, rather than a jihad against Hindus, how was it that the first step taken by Pakistan sponsored terrorists was the extermination of Kashmiri Hindus.\n\nFurthermore, the territory of J&K that is occupied by Pakistan has been subjected to ethnic re-engineering by Pakistan to such an extent that now 97% of its population is Punjabi speaking. This while India spent 70 years shielding the residents of the Kashmir Valley from encroachment by any Indian ethnic population. In addition, while India has spent billions of dollars every year in Kashmir for development, infrastructure, education, hospitals, and increasing living standards, the indigenous inhabitants of PoK have no access to modern education, healthcare or transportation infrastructure.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe US must understand that there is a paradigm shift in India because of Islamic terrorism. Pakistan's cross border jihad in the last three decades has led to the rise of a radical fringe within Hindu society which has manifested itself in cow vigilantism and lynchings of innocent Muslims over beef. It has also politically polarized Indian society, which has been culturally largely peaceful, tolerant and pluralistic. If Pakistan continues to use jihad as a tool of foreign policy towards India, it will only strengthen the extremist elements among Hindus. That in turn will influence the overall politics of India, pushing it further right and aggressive. As it is, there is almost complete unanimity in India that any government in New Delhi must be on an offensive against Pakistan's cross-border terrorism across the Line of Control. If the world assists Pakistan's jihad against India under the pretence of human rights, the radicals will push New Delhi to tell that world in no uncertain terms that the Democratic Republic of India needs no lectures from patrons of the world's prime state sponsor of terrorism.\n\nTherefore, US policy makers should understand that any tolerance for Islamist terrorism against India in Kashmir or other regions, will only further empower the fringe amongst Hindus. The US pressure following the 9/11 attacks forced Pakistan to dial down the rhetoric of jihad in Kashmir, but its energies since then have been spent primarily in keeping the Kashmiri population inflamed against the Indian state, and preventing peace and normalcy to return.\n\nPakistan eagerly awaits America's defeat and withdrawal from Afghanistan, before reigniting the flame in Kashmir again. In the meantime, before the assault on Kashmir is renewed, Pakistan will go around the world projecting Indian state's efforts to keep peace as \""gross human rights violations by India\"". But if democracy means anything, and if we want to continue to believe that liberal democracies are natural allies, then as duly elected legislators of one of the great democracies of the world, you are obliged to recognize Kashmir as a victim of Pakistan's unrelenting efforts to destroy it and its people by cross-border terrorism.\n\nIt is time the US stopped, directly or indirectly, helping the cruel, brutal, and unjust Islamic Republic of Pakistan in causing relentless violence against ordinary Kashmiri Muslims and other communities in India. Members of Congress concerned about Kashmir can indicate their sincerity by holding Pakistan accountable for its support of terrorism and grotesque human rights violations in Pakistan occupied Kashmir, Balochistan, and Sindh."
